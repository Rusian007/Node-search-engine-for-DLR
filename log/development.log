The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4.00/4.30 PM on 4.1.79. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward upto the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3.00/3.30 PM on the following day the accused were alleged to have been secen along with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs 11 & 12 . The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence-and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed.

But this burden is somewhat lighter than that of the prosecntion. The accused could be considered to have discharged his burden if he succeeds in creating a reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances that would absolve him of criminal liability, but the prosecution is to discharge its burden by establishing the guilt of the accused. An accused's burden 1s lighter, because the court is to consider his plea only after, and not before, the prosecution leads evidence for sustaining a conviction. When the prosecution failed to prove that the husband was in his house where his wife was murdered, he cannot be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence. The State Vs.

Power of a High Court to institute a contempt proceeding is a special juris- diction which is inherent in all courts of record and  the High Court Division can deal with it summarily  and adapt its own procedure. Normally contempt proceedings are disposed of by affidavits and counter-affidavits. Question of taking evidence would have arisen if the petitioners specifically denied the statements made in the petition for drawing up a proceeding for contempt. Badsha Mia Vs. Abdul Latif Majumder (Criminal) 10 <br> Criminal Trial <br> Last Seen—This is a case in which a minor boy, the victim of murder, was called away by and seen in the company of the two young accused for the last time before disappearance and then some time thereafter the body of the victim was found out. The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4.00/4.30 PM on 4.1.79. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward upto the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3.00/3.30 PM on the following day the accused were alleged to have been secen along with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs 11 & 12 . The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence-and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position, thercfore, comes to this that the third circumstance, that of, seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim's body was found was not satisfactorily established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab. The High Court Division has correctly applied the rule as to circumstantial evidence in the facts of the present case. The State Vs. Khasru @ Syed Mostafa Hossain (Criminal) 182 <br> Alibi—Magistrate cannot discharge accused persons on the plea of alibi that they were at different places at the time of commission of offences alleged by the prosccution—Magistrate's “finding\" in this regard is based on no evidence. Mere submission of some papers supporting alibi is neither sufficient nor admissible as the stage of adducing defence evidence was not yet come Magistrate's order of discharge was not sustainable as it was based on gross misconception of law. Nannu Gazi Vs. Awlad Hossain (Criminal) 63 <br> Alibi—Burden of proof—Burden of proving: alibi in a wife-killing case—It is true that the burden                of proving a plea of alibi or any other plea specifically set up by an accused-husband for absolving him of criminal liability lies on him. But this burden is somewhat lighter than that of the prosecntion. The accused could be considered to have discharged his burden if he succeeds in creating a reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances that would absolve him of criminal liability, but the prosecution is to discharge its burden by establishing the guilt of the accused. An accused's burden 1s lighter, because the court is to consider his plea only after, and not before, the prosecution leads evidence for sustaining a conviction. When the prosecution failed to prove that the husband was in his house where his wife was murdered, he cannot be saddled with any onus to prove his innocence. The State Vs.

Considering all aspects of the matter, there has been a manifest disregard of the accepted principles of appreciation of evidence and consequently a miscarriage of justice. State Vs. Abdus Sattar (Criminal) 44 Section 5—Chance witness—He is found to be at the place of occurrence by chance or coincidence at the time the offence was committed. His evidence need not be rejected outright, but it is to be weighed with caution and may be viewed with suspicion if witnesses are partisan or inimically disposed towards the accused. State Vs. Md. Shafiqul Islam(Criminal) 92 Section 5—Wife-killing case—In such a case, there could be no eye-witness of the occurrence, apart from inmates of the house who may refuse to tell the truth. The neighbours may not also come forward to depose. The prosecution is, therefore, necessarily to rely on circumstantial evidence. State Vs. Md.

The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4-00/4-30 PM on 4.1.79 . This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward upto the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3-00/3-30 PM on the following day the accused were alleged to have been scen along . with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs 11 & 12 . The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The posi- tion, therefore, comes to this that the third circumstance, that of, seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim's body was found was not satisfactorily established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab. The High Court Division has correctly applied the rule as to circumstantial evidence in the facts of the present case. State Vs.
