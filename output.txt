Acquisition and Requisition of
Immovable Property Ordinance
[11 of 1982]

Section 46— Rules of 1983 [r. 8(3)]—The
report relating to costs of the constructions made in
the acquired land filed by the Private Engineering
Firm ought not to have been taken into
consideration by the Arbitrator and having had taken
into consideration the said unauthorized report of
the Private Engineering Firm in assessing the costs
of constructions in the acquired land in awarding
costs for construction, the appellate Court was quite
correct in setting aside the judgment of the
Arbitrator and sending the case back on remand for
fresh trial. Land Acquisition Officer vs Md Abdul

Latif Biswas (Civil) 255

Administrative Tribunals Act
[VII of 1981]

Section 4—The
tribunal cannot grant gratuitous relief and if such a relief is granted the
same should be construed as relief granted in excess
of jurisdiction. The Act has not provided for any
such authority to the tribunal to give such a relicf as
has been given to the authority in the present case
before us. Government of Bangladesh vs Md
Anwarul Islam (Civil) 273

Anti-Corruption Commission Act
[V of 2004]

Sections 18 & 26—-Section 26 envisages that
before issuance of the notice, the Commissioner(s)
must be satisfied about the allegation. It is their
satisfaction and of nobody elses. But by sub-section
(2) of section 18, the Commissioners can only ratify
the 'satisfaction' of the Secretary which is certainly
not stipulated in section 26. Anti-Corruption
Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir
(Criminal) 290

Section 26—Satisfaction—Satisfaction must
be of the Commission itself constituted of no other
person than its Commissioners. The relevant order
to submit assets may be issued by any of ils
authorised officials but the decision to issue such an
/norder must be recorded by the Commissioner(s).
Anti-Corruption Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin

Khan Alamgir (Criminal) 290

Section 26—1f any person acts beyond his
authority, to the prejudice of any person, such acts
cannot be ratified or validated by post facto
legislation, his action remains void. Anti-Corruption
Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir
(Criminal) 290

Section 26—Notice—A notice must allow a
reasonable time to check-up the details of the assets
of a person, if necessary, on examination of his
records and after consultation with his lawyers and
other concerned persons. Section 26 certainly does
not envisage a notice upon a person who is in
detention and he is not expected to give any details
of his assets within the time specified. The person
concerned must be afforded a fair and reasonable
opportunity to respond to the notice, otherwise, it is
no notice in the eye of law. A notice issued under
section 26 of the Act to a detenu, away from his
hearth and home, cannot be said to be a fair and
bonafide exercise of power. Anti-Corruption
Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir
(Criminal) 290

Sections 26 & 27—Whether the appellant
has disproportionate wealth, he has concealed his
known source of income, there is mis-joinder of
charges and the trial of the appellant on facts
allegedly committed prior to the promulgation of
Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 constitute
an offence under the Durnity Daman Commission
Ain are disputed facts can only be decided on
evidence at the trial. Habibur Rahman Mollah vs
State (Criminal) 233

Sections 26 & 27—Since the prosecution
case is almost over and the appellant put his defence
by cross-cxamining the witnesses, in view of the

consistent views of the superior Courts of thig sub.
continent that the High Court Division Which
exercising its power under section 561A of the Code
should not usurp the jurisdiction of the trial Court
Habibur Rahman Mollah vs State (Criminal) 233

Section 26(2)—No legal impediment for the
Commission to issue fresh notice under section 2g
of the Act, if so advised, but not in those cases wher
the accused has already been acquitted on meri; of
the case as is in this case. Anti-Corrupyig,
Commission vs Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgy

(Criminal) 290

Section 27—Section 109 of the Penal Code is
included in paragraph 'Gha' of the schedule to the
ACC Act, 2004 for abetment to any offence under
the schedule is committed by any sort of
involvement or complicity. Such offence could
never be intended or could be a substantive offence,
The High Court Division held that no such offence
of abetment could be conceived of in respect of an
offence under section 26(2) or 27(1) of the ACC
Act, 2004. Accordingly, lodging of FIR, taking
cognizance, initiation of criminal proceedings
against the writ-petitioners are unwarranted,
unauthorized and without jurisdiction. Anfi-
Corruption Commission vs Shamima Begum (Civil)

277

Section 27—In the absence of any statement
of assets; there was no scope to submit any
explanation for acquisition of assets there was no
scope for him to submit any explanation for
acquisition of the assets. No citizen could ‘be
arraigned for such a severe offence in the absence
service of any notice or order for explaining the
source of income. Offence of abetment under
section 109 equally could not be conceived of with
regard to such an offence. Anti-Corruplion
Commission vs Nargis Begum (Civil) 279
