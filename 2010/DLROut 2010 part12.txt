Customs Act (IV of 1969)Section 25A9. Be it mentioned the RFP forms an integralrar of the Contract and it is apparent from the sametat the petitioners were to provide consultancyservices. Section 6 of the RFP reads as follows :<br>"2.4(c) PSI Company, at its own cost, shallassist National Board of Revenue in its capaci-ty building efforts through imparting training ofthe officers of Customs on any customs relatedmatter. The subjects of training shall include,inter alia, valuation, classification, post clear-ance audit, prevention of commercial forgeryand fraud risk management, intelligence man-agement etc. The training modules number andkind of trainees and locations to be decided inConsultation with National Board of Revenue.However, number of trainees in any month shallnot be less than 10(ten) and at least two inspec-tion programs of the PSI Company's overseasOffices, with a duration of 7(seven) days each,must be included in the modules.<br>2(d) PSI Company will assist NationalBoard of Revenue in developing a comprehen-sive Valuation Database and CommodityDatabase for HS Classification, profiling ofimporters, strengthening the existing automa-tion of customs processing as well as installa-tion of new system to ensure transparency andincrease efficiency of the customs department.PSI Company must share, free of charge, all ofits existing database resources, on customsrelated issues, maintained by its officers in dif-ferent countries as and when required by theNational Board of Revenue and deliver thesame in the formal asked for.<br>2(e) The PSI Company will supportNational Board of Revenue in developing aneffective automation Risk Management Systemin all customs stations. 2(h) Upon request fromexporters, PS] Company may provide informa-tion on the existing enactments, rules, regula-tions and standards followed in Bangladesh intrade related matters."10. The petitioners commenced work on IstOctober, 2008 immediately after entering into theContract. They rendered their invoices in accor-dance with Contract. Thereafter the petitionersreceived the impugned letters (Annexure A series)and came to know that the respondents had wronglytreated the petitioners as 'Surveyors' and deductedVAT at the rate of 13.04% (on the gross amount of theinvoice) from the petitioners’ invoice submitted tilldate. Though the petitioners by its letters dated 1-2-09and 23-4-2009 requested the respondent to deductVAT at the rate of 4.5% to which the respondent paidno heed thereto and in that stage the petitionersmoved this Division and obtained the present Rule.11. At the very outset we think it would be nec-essary to mention that after a long legal battle whichstarted from High Court Division and ended up inthe Appellate Division, it has been finally settled inthe case on National Board of Revenue Chairman vsIntertek Testing Services International Ltd 1] BLC(AD) 233 that the services rendered by PSI Agencyare vatable.12. Mr Fida M Kamal, Mr Akhter Imam, thelearned Senior Counsels and Mr Abdullah M Hasan,the learned counsel appeared in all these writ peti-tions. Mr Fida M Kamal, afer taking us in minutedetails each and every Annexures with the petitionpinpointed the different aspects to show that underthe new scheme pursuant to advertisement            (Annexure B-1) the services solicited by the respon-dents from the petitioners were absolutely as that of‘Consultants’. That is to say the petitioners wererequired only to render consultancy services as‘Consultants’ and not as ‘Surveyors’ but the petition-ers became aggrieved when they found that therespondents in utter disregard of VAT Act, and theVAT Rules of 1991, deducted VAT from the peti-tioners at the rate of 13.04% instead of 4.5% treat-ing them as ‘Surveyors’. He further submits that the"Instruction to Applicants" of the tender documentexpressly provides that the petitioners are and wouldbe treated as 'Consultants'. Moreover, the petitionershave been classified as 'Consultants' by Income TaxAuthority and they have been paying advanceincome tax under section 52A of the Income TaxOrdinance, 1984 as ‘Consultants’. To him it appearsthat the respondents are treating the petitioners as‘Surveyors' only for collecting more revenue.Further the petitioners were also given express rep-resentation by the Government that they would be‘Consultants’. The petitioners were appointedthrough QCBS method (which is only used forselection of Consultants) and different wings of therespondents i.e. Income Tax department, have clas-sified the petitioners to be ‘Consultants’.13. Further he submits that the scheme of theVAT regime in respect of the 'Surveyors' and‘Consultants' i.e. the PSI Agents were set out in theVAT Act and Rules and in particular in respect ofservices in 3 SROs being (i) SRO No.189-Ain-2008/49 1-Mushok, (ii) SRO No.193-Ain/2008/495-Musak and (iii) SRO No.197-Ain/2008/499-Mushak all dated 29-6-2008.14. SRO No.189-Ain/2008/491-Mushokdefines "Jarip Shangstha (Surveyor) and 'Consul-tant’ as follows :<br>So quotation 'So 20 So. 20 00' denote ‘JaripShangstha' and 'So © So ©2.00 denote consultan-cy firm and supervisory firm. In SRO No.197-Ain/2008/499-Mushok rate of VAT of those twohave been fixed at 15% for Surveyor and 4.5% forthe Consultant (Annexure-F series). He further sub-mits that functions of the petitioners do not fallwithin the functions carried out by a Surveyor. Hefurther submits that though SRO No.105-Ain/2009/513-Mushok dated 11-6-2009 modifiedthe definition of "Surveyor" the Finance Act, 2009made no change to the definition of "Consultants"which remained as before.15. Next he submits that the PSI Scheme, |which is acknowledged worldwide, had been intro-duced to implement the Government’s policy to setup an efficient Customs Department. As a means ofimplementation of the Government's policy throughthe PSI Agent, the Customs Act 1969 was amendedmaking PSI schemes mandatory and further impos-ing penalty if goods are imported in Bangladeshwithout CRF Certificate issued by the PSI Agencies.As such, it is clear that the PSI Agents, including thepetitioners are providing necessary support to theGovernment in implementation of its policy. To thisextent, the PSI Agencies, including the petitionershave been carrying out feasibility studies, assistingin implementation of project, providing advice to            the Goverment to implement ils project to increasethe eficiency of the Customs Department and alsowhieh is evi-dent trom the responsibilities of the petitioners, 3set out in Seetion 6 of the REP,supervising by working With it close16. From the obligations of the petitioners areferred to above it could be found that their primaryobligation is to give effect to the Government poli-cys the petitioners for all material purpose, areConsultants and as such the deduction of VAT at therate of 13.04% is without lawful authority and is ofno legal effect.17. His another branch of argument is that thegovernment has appointed the petitioner throughQCBS method under the Public Procurement Act,2006 and the Public Procurement Rules, 2008(which is used only for the appointment of consult-ants) the petitioners should, for all material purpos-es be treated as a ‘Consultant’ and as such, the res-pondents should collect VAT from the petitioners atthe rate of 4.5%18. Mr Akhter Imam, Senior Advocate, appear-ing in writ petition No.5737 of 2009 submits that thesettled proposition of law is that if there is any ambi-guity in the fiscal law arising out of any interpreta-tion in particular, the benefit will go in favour of thesubject. On this point the leamed Counsel referredto the decision of Sadharan Bima Corporation vsBengal Liner reported in_48_DLR (AD) 143 andreferred to paragraph 9 of the said decision wherethe said proposition “of law has been propounded,The learned Counsel emphatically submits that theVital decision of National Board of Revenue vsIntertek Testing Services International Lid 11 BLC(AD) 233 has only settled that the services of the PSIAgencies are vatable and nothing more. It is now tobe decided by this Division the status of the peti-tioners whether they would be termed as the‘Consultants’ or "Surveyors" since the earlier deci-sion has given no light on the point.20. He then submits that the procurementprocess provided for negotiation upon the terms ofthe contract, specifically, the financial bid, andhence the government had numerous opportunitiesto rectify its representation had there been any ambi-guity or inadvertent error therein. Any misrepresen-tation in the contractual documents could have beenremedied by making necessary amendments prior topetitioner signing the contract but yet the govem-ment did not do so; this is clear manifestation of theintention of the Government to treat the petitionersas Consultants for all material purpose. TheGovernment, is thus prevented from going backfrom its representation in the Tender Documentbecause of the doctrine of estoppel and the contrapreferentum rule of construction under which, it issettled by the Hon'ble Appellate Division in the caseas referred to above that in the event of any ambi-guity, which is denied, the document is to be inter-preted agianst the person who prepared the same.21. Mr Mahmudul Islam, the learned SeniorCounsel appearing with Ms Nahid Mahtab, thelearned Counsel on behalf of the respondents by fil-ing affidavit-in-opposition, reply to the supplemen-tary affidavit filed by the petitioner, on the otherhand, vehemently opposes the Rule and submits thatthis Rule should be discharged outright beingdevoid of any substance. Mr Islam categoricallydenied the submission made by the petitioners andsubmitted that respondents had decided to appointthe Pre-shipment Inspection Agencies (PSI) for anew term pursuant to the provisions provided in Pre-shipment Inspection Rules, 2002 (SRO No.255;Law/2002/1973/Customs dated 9th September2002 . The learned Counsel pointed out the maintasks of the PSI Agents as laid down in the Rulewhich are as follows :<br>            a. To verity the description of quantity andnd packing list supplied by the exporters,quality of goods as per invoice<br>b. To determine the correct HS Code of thegoods in accordance with the existinglaws and Rules.<br>c. To determine and certify correct value inaccordance with existing law and Rules.<br>d. To ensure compliance with shipment pro-cedures and container sealing with exist-ing law and Rules.<br>e. To issue CRFs and NNRF after under tak-ing proper inspection (physical and other-wise) prior to shipment of consignment tobe exported as per Rules,<br>f. To help prepare and sustain a valuationDatabase."22. He further submits that the above men-tioned services rendered by the PSI agencies areservices of the 'Surveyors" as held by the AppellateDivision in 77 BLC (AD) 233 the decision referredto above. The respondents have quite legally levied/AT upon the agencies as 'Surveyors' on the feesand commission received agianst the service ren-dered by the agency. Moreover, the services ren-dered by the agencies as mentioned above are in noWay come under the consultation services as allegedby the petitioners, He submits that the petitionersservices are not marked as having intellectual,strategic character of the consultants rather the serv-ices are of clerical in nature. The mere fact that theworks of the petitioners indicates additional servic-es of consultancy in a very limited manner does notrender them a Consultants when principally they arerequired under the agreement to perform the func-tions of Ba Az, (Surveyors).23. Further he submits that PSI agents are ren-dering diflerent kind of services, Consulting services from a small component of the responsibilities ofthe petitioners, The functions of PSI Agencies areprescribed in Clause 8 of the PSI Rules, 2002 . Inaddition to the functions under clause 8 the PSIagencies have some responsibilities under clause 9of the PSI Rules  24. Highlighting all these provisions thelearned Counsel finally submits that PSI agenciesconducts training programs/study tours/inspectionprogram as per requirement of law under the PSIRules, 2000 which is described in Appendix 1 of theContract agreement. Moreover, in the umbrella con-tract one on the small components, which is of con-sulting service, does not put them to the category ofConsultants, The petitioners have rightly treated assurveyors having agreed to do the work as per thecontract and there is nothing arbitrary action of therespondents, The writ petitions are misconceived                        and incorrect. Merely because QCBS method is tobe used for selection of PST agent, they do notbeeome Consultants, particularly when they havecontracted principally to do the work of Surveyors.Supplementary service as consultants by PSI agen-cies is negligible and they having performed thefunction of surveyors are entitled to pay VAT at therate of 15%. He also points out that the petitionersdo not have the license of a Consultant to show thatthey are consultants under the Shulka PoramarshokLicense Bidhimala, 2000, The said Bidhimala hasbeen annexed as (Annexure 1) of the affidavit-in-opposition.25. He adds that the government had decidedto appoint PSI agents for a further period of 16months commencing from Ist September 2008 andtheir functions and responsibilities are clearly statedin the Terms of Reference (TOR) (section 6). It isfurther submitted that the Government intended thepetitioners to provide consultancy service in addi-tion to the service rendered as ‘Surveyors’. It is theadditional duty of the petitioners to provide someconsulting service as per the terms of the contract.But these additional duties of the petitioner do notput them in the category of consultants. In thisregard Ms Nahid Mahtab, the learned Counsel alsosubmits that even in reported decision of //° BLC(AD) 233 this sort of additional duties of theConsultants were there and their Lordships of theAppellate Division decided that the service of thePSI Agency are vatable as surveyors. So she candid-ly submits that this is not a new phenomenon, itcannot be inferred since there are some additionalfunctions regarding consultancy that have beenattributed to the PSI Agencies they have becomeConsultants, this is absolutely agianst the rationable.Therefore, these Rules should be discharged as theyhave no substance.26. Mr SM Moniruzzaman the LearnedAssistant Attorney-General for the respondents inhis brief submission highlighted the definition of thePre-Shipment Inspection Agency (PSI) Mentionedin the section 2 (qq) and contends that as per saiddefinition the Pre-shipment: Inspection Agencyappointed under section 25A of the Customs Act andservice charge of the said PSI Agency mentioned insection 25C of the Customs Act. As per section 25CThe Government may, by notification in the officialGazette, impose pre-Shipment inspection servicecharge on imported goods required to be inspectedby pre-shipment inspection agencies at a rate notexceeding one percent of the value of such goodsand this charge shall be collected as if it were a cus-toms duty leviable under section 18(1). And as suchthe payment of service charge made by the importerto the pre-shipment inspection Agency (PSI) regard-ing to inspect of the imported goods and the saidact/service of the PSI Agency not consultancy, if ispurely G44 (Survey) as Sf Acg (surveyor). Thusthe PSI agent is liable to pay VAT @ 15%.We have heard the learned Counsel for the peti-tioners and the respondents at length and consideredtheir submissions. We have categorically perusedeach and every Annexure with the petitions. Wehave considered supplementary affidavit and replythe affidavit-in-opposition.The only question that falls for consideration bythis Division is whether the petitioners in terms oftheir services rendered to the respondents would fallunder the category of ‘Consultants’ or ‘Surveyors’and would be vatable instead of 13.04% to 4.5%.27. At the very out, set let us digress a little andtry to trace back the history of the PSI Agency. Asper provision of section 25A of the Customs Act1969 (inserted in the Customs Act by Finance Act16 of 1999 upon repealing section 25A which wasinserted by Finance Act 11 of 1994) as well in thelight of the provision of PSI Order 1999 the servicees of the PSI agency was meant for the purpose of"Verification and Certification" of the quality, quan-tity, price description and classification of any goodsto be imported in to Bangladesh.28. Section 25A as it stands now quotedbelow :<br>"[25A. Pre-shipment inspection agenciesand assessment on the basis of their certificates<br>             (1) For the purposes of this Act, the Govern-ment may, in the prescribed manner, appointshipment inspection agencies and deter-mine the scope and manner of their certificationand related matters,<br>(2) The Government may, by notificationin the oficial Gazette, declare that the quality,quantity, price, description and customs classi:fication of any goods verified and certified inthe prescribed manner by a_pre-shipmentinspection agency shall be accepted as the basisfor assessment.<br>(3) For the purposes of this section, "price"means value of the goods determined in accor-dance with sub-section (1) and (2) of section 25)."further section 25B of the Customs Act postulates:<br>5B Mandatory pre-shipment inspection-It is mandatory for the importers to have theirimportable goods inspected by a pre-shipmentinspection agency before or at the time of ship-ment of those goods on board a vessel, aircraftor other conveyance,Provided that the Government may, bynotification in the official Gazette exempt anyclass of goods or any goods imported by anyclass of importers or any goods importedthrough a customs port or a customs station orany area within such port or station from themandatory pre-shipment inspection."Section 25C states :<br>“Pre-shipment inspection service notifica-tion in official Gazette, imposes pre-shipmentinspection service charge on imported goodsrequired to be inspected by  pre-shipmentinspection agencies at a rate not exceeding onepercent of the value of such goods and thischarge shall be collected as if it were a customsduty leviable under section 18(1)."29. It may be mentioned that acceptance of thecertificate issued by the PSI agencies was optionalfor the customs authority and that the matter of get-ting imported goods verified and certified by PSIagencies was optional for the Customs Authorityand was not compulsory. Latter on the governmentby Finance Act 16 of 1999 substituted section 254of the Customs Act 1969, and with that certificateissued by the PSI Agency was made basis for assess-ment of customs duties and other levies and verifi-cation by PSI agency was made compulsory for theimporter in respect of the goods imported.30. From the provision enunciated and enactedin section 25A and 25B, it has been found that cer-tificate issued by PSI agency was made the basis ofassessment of customs duty and other levies and thatcertification by PSI agency was made compulsoryfor the importers in respect of goods. It may be men-tioned that under the provision of section 25A asenacted in 1999 for certification of the importedgoods the PSI agency was appointed by the govern-ment. Keeping all these things in view we can safe-ly say that to specify the provision or exacting theprovision of the dimension of PSI Agency, govern-ment by amendment made the very provisions ofsection 25A and 25B and 25C of the Customs Act1969 . The reason for bringing this is only to con-strue the terms and limitations of the services to berendered by the PSI Agency as compulsorily havebeen categorized by the Government.31. Now let us revert to (Annexure B-1) i.e. therequest for expression of interest for appoint of PSIAgency. This is an advertisement published on 21stMay 2008 in the ‘Daily Star’ pursuant to notificationSRO No.255-Law/20021973/Customs dated 19thSeptember 2002 . In that advertisement in paragraph3.0 the service required to be rendered by the PSIAgency have been categorized. It says :<br>"The main task of the PSI Agencies shallbe the following :<br>(a) To verify description, quantity and quali-ty of goods as per invoices and packinglists supplied by the exporters.<br>(b) To determine the correct HS Code of thegoods in accordance with existing lawand rules,<br>            (c) To determine and certify correct value inaccordance with existing law and rules.<br>(d) To ensure compliance with shipment pro-cedures and container sealing as per rulesand orders.(ec) To issue CREs or NNRF after undertakingproper inspection (physical or otherwise).(1) To held prepare and sustain a valuationdatabase.graph 5.0 says :—PSI Agencies willbe selected in accordance with the procedure set outin "Public Procurement Act, 2006 and PublicProcurement Rules, 2008" Interested Agencies mayobtain further information from the office of theundersigned between 10-00 AM and 25-00 PM onall working days. (Annexure-B-1).32. Mr Fida M Kamal, tried to impress upon usby pin pointing some salient features of request forProposal (RFP) Annexure-C-1 to the petition thatthe short listed applications who sent the letter ofinvitation and the RFP were to submit in that regarda proposal for supply of consulting service requiredfor the assignment.33. He further points out that the selectionmethod for awarding the final contract will followthe guidelines laid down under Quality and CostBased Selection (QCBS) process and in accordancewith Public Procurement Act, 2006 and PublicProcurement Rule 2008 of Bangladesh, howeveravailable is to be disclosed. He put emphasis that incase of any conflict between Public ProcurementAct, 2006, Public Procurement Rules, 2008 withthat of PSI Rules 2002 the procedure laid down inPublic Procurement Act, 2006 and PublicProcurement Rules shall prevail as far as procure-ment process is concerned. Mr Mahmudul Islam, thelearned Counsel for he respondents, on the otherhand. also put equal emphasis to this particularaspect and tried to impress upon us that the Ruleshall prevail only as for as procurement process isconcerned. (underlined by us)Mr Fida Kamal's contention is that with all thesetrappings as it has been already discussed, the serv-ice rendered by the PSI Agencies by implicationassumes the position of the Consultants.34. He has also drawn our attention to theterms of reference from where it could be found thatfor the entire period the newly appointed Ps}Agencies will take steps to enhance the capacity ofthe department and improve standard of both offi.cers and staffs of Bangladesh Customs and transferall requisites knowledge and technology to strength.en the customs department as a whole in order toenable the department to run efficiently. These stepsare_indeed to our mind noble but the questionremains whether all these efforts put the Ps)Agencies in the category of a Consultant? The deci.rules issue.35. From SRO 189/Ain/2008/491/Mushokunder VAT Act 1991 Annexure-F to the petition, wefound definition of Jarip Shangstha from explana-tion to Jarip Shangstha. It says:            36. Certainly, these two terms cannot be put onthe same footing. They express two different conno-tations. Let us now discuss what the functions of thePSI Agencies are. At the very beginning of thePublic Procurement Rules, 2008, in Rule 2(31) wefind definition of Paramarshak (Consultant).37. In the General Conditions of Contract foremployment of PSI agency it was to provide "cer-tain cargo inspection sei as defined in this con-tract". The definition of Services is as follows :1.1 (m) Services mean the task or activitiesto be performed and the services to be providedby the PSI agency pursuant to the contractAgreement as outlined in the Terms ofReference and pre-shipment Inspection Rules2002.38. The PSI agents are appointed by theGovernment to do certain works in connection withimportable goods i.e. inspection of the goods, whichis imported into Bangladesh, and they render servicein lieu of fees and commission. In the contract ofemployment of PSI agencies dated 22-6-2008 clause17 reads as follows :<br>"Taxes and duties 17.1 The PSI agency,sub-contractors and personnel shall pay suchtaxes duties, fees and other impositions as maybe levied under the governing, the amount ofwhich is deemed to have been included in thecontract price."39. On a close reading of all these definitions.isions we geta a clear picture that the servic-insviably connesicd with the affairs of survey,(Underlined by us)40. In the decision of NBR Chairman vsIntertex Testing Services International Lid. 11 BLC(AD) 233 their Lordships detined the word "Survey"with clarity. It has been explained in that decisionthat the word i lishDictionary means—amongst others the act of view-ing, examinii r inspecting in detail specially forsome specific purpose. The word ‘verity’ conveys,            amongst others, to ascertain or test the accuracy orcorrectness of (something), specifically by examina-tion or by comparison with known data and theword verification: among others means, the actionof establishing or testing the truth or correctness offaet, theory statement, ete, by means of specialinvestigation or comparison of data.41. The whole function of the PSI Agency asdescribed in 25A of the Customs Act and in the con-tract documents reveals in ascertainment of the cor-rectness of the statement made by the importer inrespect of the goods to be imported, particularly asto quality, quantity, price, description, HS Codeclassification or, in other words, classification ofany goods as well as valuation. Further, the CustomsAuthority rightly charged VAT on the services of thePSI Agency as the Surveyors particularly on thebackground of the explanation of the Surveyors.42. Mr Imam's argument fails since we couldnot find out any ambiguity that has arisen whileinterpreting fiscal law in this field when the relevantlaws and Rules with clarity classify the status of PSIAgency to that of surveyor and not of Consultant.43. There is no denying that in the new con-tract the petitioners have to provide consultancyservices in addition to the services rendered as‘Surveyors’ but it is only the additional duty of thePetitioners to provide some consultancy services asper terms of the contract. But the additional duties ofthe petitioners do not put them in the category of theconsultants because as per PSI Rules and terms ofthe contract, PSI Agencies are appointed to performthese additional duties, Pertinently we would like tomention here that even in the contract of the casereported in // BLC (AD) 233 it would be found thatPSI Agencies were required to perform these addi-tional work. Considering the said aspect. theirLordships in that Decision finally held ;<br>"It appears that the letter dated 11-3-2001was written by the personnel of the NationalBoard of Revenue being quite unmindful of thelaw and the facts and circumstances in the back-ground whereof PSI Agency signed theContract with the Government for TenderingPSI services and as such, the PSI Agency can-not take advantage of the said letter, Moreover,there was no occasion for dividing the serviceof the PSI Agency as seen from the letter dated11-3-2001 since the service of the PSI Agencyis a single transaction i.e. rendering of serviceby the PSI Agency is reaching Customs House,It is pertinent to mention that PSI Agency sub.mitted the bid being fully aware of the nature ofthe service it would render.Further in that decision it has been observed :<br>"It is seen from section 2(qq) of theCustoms Act that PSI Agency means a personappointed under section 25A of the Customs actas a Pre-shipment Inspection Agency andincludes a representative of the person. Fromthe provision of section 25A of the Customs Actas stated thereinbefore, it is seen that theGovernment for getting the services required tobe performed into Bangladesh would get thesaid services performed through certain Agencyand that the said Agency is Pre-shipmentInspection Agency. There is nothing in the pro-vision of section 25A of the Customs Act that itis the Government itself, which would performthe services as mentioned in the said section inrespect of the importable goods. That for havingthe things as mentioned in section 25A(2) of theCustoms act get done Government appointedPSI Agency and the PSI Agency does the thingsmentioned in section 25A(2) of the CustomsAct in exchange of fees or commission. In thatstate of the matter, we are of the view that theservices rendered by PSI Agency in connectionwith the goods imported into Bangladesh is theservices of the Agency itself and the said workof the PSI Agency is not the work of theGovernment. The services of the PSI Agency isthat service of an organization from whom serv-ice would be received by the Government onpayment of fees or commission for the serviceso rendered and as regard that provision hasbeen made in the VAT ACt...............            section 2(qq) of the Customs Act is to be readwith the provision of section 25A of the saidAct and that when the provision of section 25Aof the Customs Act is read keeping in view theTB to GAT Hee it will be seen that the per-son, establishment or organization while ren-dered service in respect of one of the categoriesof the matters mentioned in the HI, the 101and the definition in section 2(qq) of theCustoms Act are not inconsistent........ essethe service of the PSI Agency starts inBangladesh, as is seen from the provision ofPSI Order, 1999 and then, for the purpose ofcompleteness of the work PSI Agency requiredto perform the said agency after initiating itsfunction for the performance whereof andAgency has been appointed the PSI Agencygoes to the foreign territory and performs theremaining part of the work there, since it is therequirement of the law that the goods are to beverified/surveyed/inspected before shipmentfor importing into Bangladesh and upon doingpart of the service in the foreign territory thePSI Agency submits its certificate, i.e. when thework undertaken by the PSI Agency is complet-ed, in Bangladesh to the prescribed authority. Itmay be mentioned PSI Agency, while partici-pating in the bid being quite aware of the natureof the work it would be required to perform."44. Section 2(qq) deals with the definition ofpre-Shipment Inspection agency.<br>It's says:<br>"Pre-Shipment inspection agency" meansany person appointed under section 25A as aPre-Shipment inspection agency and includes arepresentative of that person.45. If we read section 2(qq) and section 25A(1)and (2) of the Customs Act (as already mentioned)together it becomes clear that whole scheme of thePre-Shipment inspection agency has been construedabsolutely in a restricted implication. That is to saytheir main function is to perform inspection is termsof section 25A(1) and (2), Manifestly, pre-ShipmentC 38agencies perform the work of Surveyors and by anystretch of imagination they cannot be blended asConsultants.46. Beside, we want to view the present issuefrom another angle also. If we deeply analyze theissue before us on the basis of discussion as madeabove one thing becomes latent and clear that thereare positive laws and rules concerning PSI Agencyin minute details and those Laws and Rules portraitservice rendered by PSI Agency as "Surveyor". Butnowhere in those Laws and Rules it could be foundthat there has been any deliberation given in anymanner highlighting the PSI Agency as"Consultant". In other words we can Say that noelaborations under the scheme of Laws and Rules inthat respect are there to made us think that PSIAgency are Consultants, Further in our query wealso asked the Counsel for the petitioner to show us.the Articles and Memorandum of Association oftheir respective companies to find out whether anyof their objective clauses expresses that PSI Agencycan do Consultancy but they failed to supply us theArticles and Memorandum of Association of thoseCompanies.47. That being the position, we are constrainedto hold that the service render by the petitioners inconnection with new contract is absolutely in thenature of ‘Surveyor’ and not that of ‘Consultants’.The submissions made by the learned Counsel forthe respondents merits substance and consequentlythese Rules should be discharged.48. In the result, all these Rules are dischargedbut without any order at to cost.The order of direction given at the time ofissuance of the Rule by this Division is herebyrecalled.<br>                        HIGH COURT DIVISION(Criminal Revisional Jurisdiction)<br>Salma Masud Abdus<br>Chowdhury J SattaMd Rezaul Hasan J<br>JudgmentApril 19th, 2010.<br>Sattar alias TakuPetitioner<br>State.<br>Arms Act (XI of 1878)Section 19AThe place of recovery being a public place itcannot be said that the appellant was in exclusivepossession of that place.

The prosecution case, as has been initiatedupon lodging a first information report (FIR) on 14-10-2002 by the informant PW 1 Md Jamiruddin, asSub-Inspector of Police, briefly is that, on 13-10-2002 at about 10-05 PM the officer in charge ofKotwali Thana received an information through asecret source that Md Abdus Sattar, suspectedaccused of Kotwali PS Case No. 21 dated 9-6-2002*Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 15398 of 2007.and Kotwali PS Case No. 8 dated 5-6-2002, wentinto hide in his residence or in the residence of hisbrother Rashid situated at village Barail, PSKotwali, District Dinajpur, Having received thesecret information, the informant along with otherpolice personnel rushed towards the place of occur-rence. At about 10-25 PM they had searched thehouse of the accused's brother and arrested theaccused Abdus Sattar. On interrogation he con-fessed that on 4-6-2002, he along with 8/10 persons,had stolen gun (44) from village Naiter under thesame Police Station. The gun was kept hidden in thebamboo clump of one Krishna Master. Accordingly,the informant along with other police personnelrushed towards the said bamboo clump. Thereafter,in presence of the witnesses they recovered thealleged gun at the showing of the accused. The gunwas kept inside a white polyethylene bag wrappedup in a sky blue colour polyethylene, tied by jutemade string, barrel and butt of the gun were founddisintegrated.3. Thereafter the police duly investigated intothe case and having found a prima facie case sub-mitted charge sheet No. 403 dated 1-10-2003 undersection 19A of the Arms Act, 1878 against the con-vict petitioner.4, Thereafter the case being ready for trial thesame was transferred to the Court of Special Tri-bunal No. 1, Dinajpur, for trial, wherein it has beenregistered as Special Tribunal Case No. 289 of 2003.Subsequently the case has been transferred to theCourt of Special Tribunal No. 4 Dinajpur, for trialand the learned trial Court framed charge against theconvict petitioner under section 19A of the ArmsAct, 1878 (the Act), by an order dated 17-1-2004and the charge was explained to the accused towhich he has pleaded not guilty and claimed to betried under the law,5. That the prosecution adduced 14 witnesses.to prove its case, while the defence examined none.However from the cross examination of the defence,the defence case appears to be that the arms in ques-tion was not recovered from the exclusive posses-            sion or control of the accused-petitioner inasmuchas the same was recovered from the bamboo clumpwhich is an open and public place and that the factof alleged seizure of the arms has not been provedby any cogent or consistent evidence and, as such,the fact of recovery is doubtful,6. After close of the prosecution case theJeamed trial Court has examined the accused undersection 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure whenhe was asked as to whether he pleads guilty, uponbringing all incriminating facts and materials thatwas adduced in the course of trial evidence, but theaccused pleaded not guilty. However, the defencedid not adduce any evidence either.7, The learned trial Court, whereupon, havingheard the learned advocates representing the partiesas well as having considered the evidence on recordhave found the accused guilty of the charges broughtagainst him and passed the impugned judgment andorder convicting and sentencing him as mentionedabove.8. Being aggrieved by the said judgment andorder the convict has filed this petition under 561Aand obtained the instant rule as because the statuarytime limited for preferring an appeal has expired.9, Learned Advocate Ms Nusrat Jahan repre-senting the convict petitioner, took us through thefirst information report as well as the evidenceadduced by the parties and then submits that thearms in question has not been recovered from theexclusive possession or control of the convict peti-tioner inasmuch as admittedly the arms in questionwas recovered from a bamboo clump of one KrishnaKanta which is an open place anybody havingaccess to the same. She next submits that there arecontradictions in the deposition of the prosecutionwitnesses as regards the recovery of the arms and assuch, the very fact of alleged recovery of the arms isdoubtful and is not based on any cogent or consis-tent evidence. Finally, referring to some other con-tradictions she submits that the prosecution has mis-erably failed to prove the case against this accusedbeyond reasonable doubt and, as such, there is noevidence on record to connect the accused with or tofind him guilty in respect of the charge broughtagainst him. Hence, the impugned judgment isliable to be quashed and the accused be acquitted.10. Ms Yeasmin Begum Bithi, the learnedAssistant Attorney-General representing the statesubmits that there are adequate, cogent and reliableevidence on record based on which the impugnedjudgment and order has been passed and, as such,this is not a case of no evidence, hence interferenceby this honorable Court under section 561A of theCode of Criminal Procedure (the Code) is not calledfor.11. The points for determination in this case iswhether the impugned judgment and order is basedon no evidence and as to whether the same is liableto be quashed.12. To arrive at the conclusion we have consid-ered for our selves the evidence on record, the peti-tion filed under section 561A of the Code and heardthe learned advocate for both sides.13. PW 1 Md Jamiruddin, Sub-Inspector ofPolice and the informant during his examination inchief deposed that, having received the secret infor-mation he along with the members of his force sur-rounded the house of the brother of the accused, atvillage Barail under PS Kotwali on 13-10-2002about 10-15 AM and they have apprehended theaccused from the house of his brother Abdur Rashid.When interrogated the accused informed the policethat he has taken away an one barrel gua while com-mitting dacoity at a village named Naiter (under thesame police station) and that he has kept the saidgun under the bamboo clump of one Kirshno Masterof village Barail. He went to the said bamboo clumptaking the accused along with some other peopleand he himself, by his own hands, recovered the saidgun, etc barrel and butt kept separately inside apolyethylene paper tied with rope, as shown by theaccused. The witnesses has seen the act of recoveryof the gun and that he prepared a seizure list at theplace of occurrence at about 11-45 AM and obtainedsignature of the seizure list witnesses. He has            proved the gun, the polyethylene and the rope whichwere marked as material exhibits 1, Hand TL. Hethen proceeded towards the police station andlodged the ejahar in writing on the following day atabout 1-30 PM. The first information report wasrecorded by the OC Shahid Shokrana, which wasregistered as Kotwali PS 23/447 from which arosethe GR Case No. 482 of 2002. He has also provedthe seizure list and his signature thereon respective-ly marked as Exhibit 1 and 1/A. He has also provedthe first information report and his signature thereonmarked as Exhibit 2 and 2/A. He has also provedthe first information report form and the signature ofthe Officer-in-charge, which were marked as exhib-it 3 and 3/A. PW No. | however, could not say thedirection at which the bamboo clump was situatedfrom the house of Krishna Master. He further stat-ed that he did not mention name of the seizure listwitnesses in the first information report.PW 2 Md Nazrul Islam, a police constable, dur-ing cross-examination, stated that he was present atthe time of apprehending the accused and recoveryof the gun. PW 3 Md Salim Hossen, police consta-ble, during his cross-examination by the accused,stated that he was present at the time of apprehend-ing the accused on 13-10-2002 and recovery of thegun, PW 4 Belal Hossen, a police constable, weretendered by the prosecution. During cross-examina-tion, he deposed that he avas present at the time ofapprehending the accused and recovery of the armson 13-10-2002.PW 5 Makbul Hossen, a police constable and aseizure list witnesses, He deposed during examina-tion in chief that he went to the place of occurrencealong with the informant and that the arms wasrecovered from the bamboo clump of one KrishnaMaster at the showing of the accused and that theseizure list witnesses has signed on the seizure list atthe place of occurrence. During cross-examinationthis PW 5 disposed that—The PW 6 Md Abdur Rahim, the seizure tig,witness No. 1, during his examination in chief stat.ed that on 13-10-1999 at about 11-30 PM he went tothe police station and the police took him to the vil-lage Barail and that the police went to the bambooclump along with him from which a gun was recoy-ered and thereafter he signed the seizure list aftercoming to the police station. During cross-examj-nation this PW 6 deposed that —PW 7 Sree Mohendra Chandra Roy was alsotendered. During cross-examination he states thathe lives about one kilometer far from the place ofoccurrence and there were about 42-50 houses situ-ated near by the place of occurrence and the bambooclump is used as latrine by the local people.PW 8 Md Fazlul Haque and PW 9 Md AbdulRashid, a Sub-Inspector of Police were also ten-dered by the prosecution.PW 10 Md Sabujer Rahman, a constable ofpolice and a member of RAB-5 Rajshahi, during hisexamination in chief deposes that he went to theplace of occurrence along with the officer-in-charge.The officer-in-charge interrogated the accused aboutthe gun stolen from the village Naitor and theaccused informed that the gun has been kept in thebamboo clump Krishna Master. Thereafter this PW,the officer-in-charge and the other members of theforce, at the showing of the accused, one single bar-tel gun was recovered. Thereafter the said gun wasseized, seizure list was prepared and theInvestigation Officer filed a case after coming to thepolice station.PW 11 Md Abul Hashem, a police constable.during his examination in chief deposed that, theyhave raided the house of the brother of the accused,found the accused there and apprehended theaccused and he was interrogated there, when theaccused admitted the fact of concealing arms in abamboo clump and he was taken by the police forceto the bamboo clump of Krishna Master wherefrom            the gun was recovered. The Investigation Officerprepared the seizure list, obtained signature of thewitnesses and retumed to police station along withthe accused and filed a case against him.PW 12 Md Asraffuzzaman, a police constable,during his examination in chief deposed that hewent to the village Barail along with the officer-in-charge and the informant SI Jamir and apprehendedthe accused on 13-10-2002. The accused was interinformed that a gun stolen from the village Naitor inhas been concealed by him in the bamboo clump ofone Krishna Master. Thereafter the police forcewent to the said bamboo clump along with thesccused and that the accused himself taken out theams from the bamboo clump wrapped up in poly-ethylene sheet and kept inside the bamboo clump.Thereafter the arms was seized and signature of theseizure list witnesses were taken and they cameback to Thana along with the accused. The accusedbeing absconded this PW_ was not cross-examined.PW 13 Sree Ananda Mohon, during his exami-nation in chief deposes that on 13-10-2002 policeapprehended him while he was going to home andtook him to the bamboo clump of Krishna Masterand recovered a gun from the bamboo clump andobtained his signature on the seizure list. Theaccused being absconded this PW was not cross-examined.PW 14 Md Abdur Rahman, Sub-Inspector ofpolice and investigation officer (10) during hisexamination in chief deposed that based on the firstinformation report lodged by the informant, the offi-cer-in-charge Shahid Shokrana has filed up the firstinformation report form on 14-10-2002 he hasproved his signature on the first information reportas Exhibit 2/B. Being entrusted with the duty toinvestigate into the case, he inspected the place ofoccurrence prepared a draft sketch map, proved andmarked as Exhibit 4 and also prepared an index,proved and marked as Exhibit 5. He has proved hissignature on the draft sketch map and on the index,which were marked as Exhibit 4/1 and 5/1. He hadproduced the accused before the Court and alsorecorded statement of the witnesses under section161 of the Court. He had examined the said articlesand deposed that the gun recovered wa: ed bythe informant and that in the course of his investiga-tion he, having found a prima facie case, has sub-mitted a charge sheet dated 1-10-2003. This PWwas not cross-examined by the defence, sinceabsconded.14. Now to arrive at the conclusion as towhether this is a case of no evidence we haveassessed for ourselves the deposition of the witness-es mentioned above as well as other materials onrecord and also heard the learned advocates repre-senting the petitioner as well as the state.15. Adverting to the deposition of the PW | wefind that PW 1 deposed that he himself, by his ownhands recovered the gun, the barrel and the butt ofthe gun kept separately, wrapped up in a polyethyl-ene paper and tied up by a rope, from the said bam-boo clump of Krishna Master of village Barail.During cross-examination he further deposed thatthe gun was not taken out by the accused and that itwas covered by leaves. On the other hand, PW 5,who is the seizure list No. 4, during his cross-exam-ination deposed that “SFT FS Bue Fst ca eraGR Tyeit anit fica wren fer) SPA fre ace aSafsca Tyee Ca FCA CA 1” On the other hand, PW 6,seizure list witness No. 1, deposed that, “ator 72051aqets aaafrerca tet wees fa 1” As such we findclear and vital contradictions as to the manner oftecovery of the gun and that cast serious doubt as tothe fact of the recovery of the gun.16. We, therefore, are constrained to hold thatthe evidence as regards the recovery of the gun isinconsistent and the prosecution has failed to provethe fact of recovery of the gun by any consistent,cogent and unimpeachable evidence. As such theevidence relied on to prove the fact of recovery ofthe gun is no evidence in the eye of law.17. PWS, inhis deposition, described the placefrom where the gun has been allegedly recovered asfollows:             Hence we find that there is no evidence to showthat the arms in question was recovered from theexclusive possession or control of the accused asalleged by the prosecution. The principle of law laiddown in 50 DLR 356 is applicable in the facts andcircumstances of this case. It has been held in thatcase that, the place of recovery being a public placeit cannot be said that the appellant was in exclusivepossession of that place. That being so, the appel-lant cannot be held liable under section 19A of theAmns Act.18. We have also noticed that, in the first infor-mation report it has been narrated that the gun wasstolen from a village named Naiter on 4-6-2002,PW 10 and PW 12 in their deposition also stated thatthe gun in question was stolen from the villageNaiter, but the informant while deposed as PW 1 tes-tified that the gun in question was taken away by theaccused while committing dacoity at the village ofNaiter. If the gun was either stolen or looted whilecommitted dacoity by the accused, as alleged by theprosecution, then there must be an owner andclaimant to whom belong the gun and the seized gunshould have been delivered to the person who isentitled to the legal possession thereof after conclu-sion of the trial as per provision of section 517 of theCode, but the act of forfeiting the gun in this case,cast a doubt on the prosecution case as to how thegun has come into the possession of the accused.This does not expel the possibility of a planted case,considered in the context of the prosecution caseitself.19. In view of the findings recorded above, weare of the view that the impugned judgment andorder is based on no evidence, accordingly we findmerit in this rule.20. In the result the Rule is made absolute andthe impugned judgment and order of conviction andsentenced dated 14-1-2007 passed by SpecialTribunal Judge, Special Tribunal No, 4, Dinajpur inSpecial Tribunal Case No, 289 of 2003 arising out ofKotwali Police Station Case No. 23 dated 14-10.2002 corresponding to GR No. 482 of 2002 convict.ing the petitioner under section 19A of the ArmsAct, 1878 and sentencing him to suffer rigorousimprisonment for 14 (fourteen) years is herebyquashed. The convict petitioner should be set at lib-erty immediately, unless his detention is required inconnection with any other case.21.

One Akbar Ali Sheikh, father of deceasedNazrul Islam, lodged a first information report on11-5-1992 with Pabna Police Station being No.9(5)92 under sections 364/342/325/302/34 of thePenal Code against the accused appellants and 16others,3. The prosecution case, in brief, is that on10-5-1992 night following Sunday informant's sonNazrul Islam, Helal, son of Seraj and Ekram, son ofNazumuddin, of village Gobindapur while patrol-ling the deep tubewell commissioned for irrigationof the 'IRRI' crops, then the accused Atahar,Mutahar, Sohrab, Bellal, Ishaque, Babu, Farid,Asadullah, Nabah, Waz Ali Biswas, MohirulBiswas, A Jalil, Azimuddin, Asrab, Abdul Karim,Sabed Ali, Sobhan, Khairul, Shafiqur Rahman(Shafi), Ibrahim, Rawsan Ali, Kafiluddin Biswasand Alam caught hold of informant's son NazrulIslam and his labourers Helal and Ekram by theorder of Kafiluddin Biswas and carried them over tothe house of Kafiluddin Biswas and that theaccuseds tied Nazrul Islam and two others on a falseallegation of theft of Irri paddy and started beatingthem mercilessly at which they raised hue and crywhereupon witness Ajai, Ansar and Fazlur Rahmancame to the house of the informant, It is further stat-ed that the informant along with his sons, relations,Hashem member and Habibur Rahman came to thehouse of Kafiluddin Biswas and found that his sonNazrul Islam was murdered and Helal and Ekramlying wounded; and that the informant and his com-panion asked Helal and Ekram about the incident atwhich they narrated the story that the accuseds allona sudden at night of 10-5-1992 entered into deeptubewell house, tied them up and carrying themthrough field by giving serious beating whereupon.Nazrul died on the way. It is further stated thatabout 10/12 years back son of Kafiluddin Biswaswas murdered and in that case the informant was anaccused wherefore Kafiluddin Biswas committedthe instant occurrence in taking revenge of thatcase.4. Afier filing of the case, Police took upinvestigation, visited the place of occurrence, seizedalamat as per seizure list, prepared sketch map withseparate index of the place of occurrence, examinedthe witnesses and recorded their statements undersection 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure andthereafter submitted charge sheet against theaccuseds being No. 182 dated 12-8-1992 under sec-            tions 364/342/302/325/323/34 of the Penal Codeagainst all the FIR-named_ accused persons.5. Afler filing of the charge sheet against theaccuseds, the case record was sent to the learnedSessions Judge, Pabna who transferred the same tothe Additional Sessions Judge, Pabna for trial.6. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,Pabna on the basis of material available on recordframed charge against the accused persons undersections 302/34/325/34 of the Penal Code and readit over to them in open Court and they pleaded notguilty and demanded for trial.7. The prosecution has examined 15 witness-es who were cross-examined by the defence and thedefence examined none.8. After closure of the prosecution witnesses,the accused persons were examined under section342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to whichthey repeated their innocence and the defence didnot adduce any evidence on their behalf.9. The defence case as could be gatheredfrom the trend of cross-examination is the totaldenial and their case, inter alia, is that the accusedsare innocent and they have been falsely implicatedin this case out of enmity and personal grudge.10. The further defence case is that thedeceased Nazrul Islam, Helal and Ekram might havestolen the IRRI paddy for which the mob assaultedthem for which deceased Nazrul Islam might havedied.11, Thereafter, in considering the evidence onrecord as well as the facts and circumstances of thecase, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Pabnafound the accuseds Atahar, Motahar, Bellal,Ishaque, Babu and Karim guilty under sections302/34 of the Penal Code and convicted each ofthem thereunder and sentencing each of them to suf-fer rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fineof Taka 5000 in default to suffer rigorous imprison-ment for 3(three) months more and the learnedAdditional Sessions Judge, Pabna found theaccuseds Kafiluddin Biswas, Asadullah aliasAsadul, Nawan alias Nubir, Sahed Ali, Ashraf,Ibrahim, Khairul, Sobhan, Rowshan, Abdul Jalil,Mohirul, Owisuddin, Azimuddin alias Azim, andFariduddin not guilty under sections 302/34 of thePenal Code and acquitted them thereunder.12. The accused appellants being aggrieved byand dissatisfied with the conviction under sections302/34 of the Penal Code have come up with thepresent appeal which is opposed by the respondentState.13. Mr JBM Hasan, the learned Advocate forthe appellants, took us through the FIR, chargesheet, charge so framed, the deposition of the prose-cution witnesses, impugned judgment and materialpapers included in the paper book and submits thatthe investigation of the case was held in a perfunc-tory way which prejudiced the defence; that thecharges framed against the accused appellants werevague, ambiguous and non speaking allegationsseriously prejudicing the accused appellants indefence of their cases; that in the examination of theaccused appellants under section 342 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure, they were afforded with noinformation as to the circumstances and accusationwhich they were to explain, resulting in an illegalityvitiating the entire trial; that no independent and dis-interested eye-witness deposed in the case and eventhere is no unbroken chain of circumstances Provingthe case beyond all reasonable doubts and that therebeing no independent and disinterested eye-witness-es in support of the prosecution case. It is furtherstated that the learned Additional Sessions Judgeought to have held that for non-examination of inde-pendent and disinterested charge sheeted witnessesa presumption under section 114(g) of the EvidenceAct be applicable and had those witnesses beenexamined, it is possible that a different case wouldhave come out; that the learned Additional SessionsJudge on surmise and conjecture and without appre-ciating the evidence on record in their true perspec-tive arrived at a decision occasioning failure of jus-tice.            14. The learned Advocate for the appellantcited the decisions in the case of Abdul Gafur vsState reported in 1992 BLD (AD) 90, in the case ofAnnadi alias Avenuddin vs State reported in 6 BLC310, in the case of Shah Alam ys State reported in42 DLR (AD) 31 and in the case of Mahiruddin vsState reported in 1986 BLD (AD) 318 in support ofhis contention,15. Mr Rabiul Ahsan Habib, the learnedAssistant Attorney-General for the State, opposesthe appeal and submits that the prosecution provedits case against the appellants by most consistent,corroborative and overwhelming evidence of com-petent witnesses. He further submits that theleamed Additional Sessions Judge, Pabna was per-fectly justified in convicting and sentencing theappellants on the basis of cogent and reliable evi-dence and his judgment does not suffer from anymis-reading and non-reading of evidence. Theleamed Assistant Attorney-General further submitsthat all the prosecution witnesses are natural, proba-ble and competent witnesses and there is no internalpoints of falsehood in their evidence on any pointand, as such, the impugned judgment calls for nointerference by this Court.16. The only point for determination in theappeal is, whether the learned Additional SessionsJudge, Pabna is justified in convicting and sentenc-ing the accuseds appellants under sections 302/34 ofthe Penal Code.17. To appreciate the legality and improprietyof the impugned judgment, it is necessary to scruti-nise the law and evidence relating to the facts of thecase,18. The allegation against the accused appel-lants is that in the night on 10-5-1992 while thedeceased Nazrul Islam along with Helal and Ekramwere guarding deep tubewell, the accused personstook them to the house of Kafiluddin and assaultedthem on the plea of stealing IRRI paddy and thatbecause of such assault Nazrul Islam succumbed tohis injuries. :ne 3919. On the other hand, defence totally deniessuch allegation stating that due to stealing of paddythe mob assembled at the place of occurrence whomight have assaulted the victim Nazrul Islam andothers.20. The allegations against the accused appel-lants have no legal value unless these are substanti-ated by cogent and reliable evidence.21. The fundamental and basic presumption inthe administration of Criminal Law and justicedelivery system is the innocence of the allegedaccuseds and till the charges are proved beyond rea-sonable doubt on the basis of clear, cogent, credibleor unimpeachable evidence, the question of punish-ing the accuseds does not arise.22. In a criminal trial, the burden of provingthe guilt of the accused beyond all reasonabledoubts always rests on the Prosecution and on itsfailure, it cannot fall back upon the evidenceadduced by the accused in support of his defence torest its case solely thereon. In Criminal cases, it isfor the prosecution to bring the guilt home to theaccused.23. Where the accused raises the plea of alibiburden lies on him to substantiate that fact at least tothe extent of a reasonable probability. Even if theevidence produced is capable of creating a doubtwhether the accuseds took part in the occurrencethen the accuseds are entitled to benefit of doubt.24, Now let us see how far the prosecution hassucceeded in proving the case and how far evidenceof PWs inspire the confidence of the Court.First of all, we like to scan the evidence of pros-ecution as regard the place of occurrence, time ofoccurrence and manner of occurrence. We find seri-ous contradictions in the evidence on record.25. In the FIR Form, the place of occurrencewas shown at Pargobindapur under Neyamotpurmouza and in the body of FIR, the place of occur-rence was shown in the house of Kafiluddin undermouza Hamchapur which is 3(three) miles away            from Pargobindapur. PW 9, Abdul Quddus Khanwas called for treatment of victim Nazrul Islam who.found the dead body of Nazrul Islam by the side ofroad which was out side the house of KafiluddinBiswas. Supporting PW 9, PW 4, Seraj alsodeposed that Nazral Islam was not found in thecourtyard of Kafiluddin Biswas and the dead bodyof Nazrul Islam was found by the side of road. Thuswe find divergent evidence as regard the place ofoccurrence and as a matter of fact, the place ofoccurrence has been shifted which has seriouslyprejudiced the prosecution case,26. The time of occurrence was shown in theFIR Form at 1-00 PM dated 11-5-1992. In thecharge sheet, it is stated that the accused personsbrought out Nazrul Islam from the shed of deeptubewell at 1-00 PM and assaulted him mercilesslywhereby he died, PW 1, Ali Akbar, testified thatoccurrence took place at night following 11-5-1992.27. PW 9, Abdul Quddus deposed that theoccurrence took place in the early morning when itwas a bit dark. Thus we also find divergent evi-dence as regard the time of occurrence which castsdoubt lin the prosecution case.28. The pertinent question for consideration inthis appeal is, the manner of occurrence. Thoughmotive is not the important factor for consideration,still it rings our mind that why would the accusedssuddenly attack the victim Nazrul Islam and others,we find no reason of such attack.29. The prosecution stated in the FIR that theaccused persons assaulted Nazrul Islam, Helal andEkram taking a false plea of stealing IRRI paddy.30. It appears from the evidence of eye-witnessMd Helal that 20/30 people attacked them and there-afier 50/60 people assembled there. PW 9 AbdulQuddus Khan deposed that 200/300 people gatheredthere. The evidence of prosecution supports thedefence version that Nazrul Islam, Helal and Ekrammight have stolen IRRI paddy for which the mobbeat them as a result of which the victim NazrulIslam had died, The above facts and evidence plain-ly disclose that the occurrence took place over steal.ing of IRRI paddy for which many people assaultedNazrul Islam, Helal and Ekram as thieves. It gener.ally happens in our country that when the thieves arecaught they are given public beating. Such incidentsare not uncommon in our country, particularly in thevillage area. It is not uncommon to see that when aperson is apprehended on the allegation of theft orother offence passions run high and people whogather round the unfortunate person try to give a fistand blow often forgetting that they themselves areindulging in an act which is culpable and may evencost the life of the victim. Such thing has happenedin the present case. In such circumstances, it is verydifficult to assess the liability of the accuseds. Allthese facts go to show that the learned trial Courtclearly failed to ascertain the cause of the death ofdeceased Nazrul Islam. From the above evidence, itis at least capable of creating doubt whether theaccuseds were there at the time of happening orwhether they assaulted victim Nazrul Islam and, insuch circumstances, the accused persons are entitledto get benefit of doubt because the defence alibi hasgot support by the evidence of the prosecution. Thedefence plea is reasonably probable to us.31. Moreover, it appears from the evidence ofPW 1 Akbar Ali that the fathers of the deceasedNazrul Islam, Helal and Ekram were accuseds in themurder case of Shafi member. The relatives of thevictim filed that case. Thus it appears that there wasprevious enmity between the parties. Enmity cutsboth ways. It is the contention of the defence thatafter stealing IRRI paddy by the deceased NazrulIslam and others and the victim Nazrul Islam wasbeaten by the mob and taking this advantage, theaccused persons have been falsely implicated in thiscase out of previous enmity and grudge. From thetestimonies of the PWs, it clearly reveals that theymade contradictory statements regarding place ofoccurrence, time of occurrence and manner ofoccurrence as a result of which the prosecution hasfailed to prove time, place and manner of occurrencebeyond any shadow of doubt.            32. Now let us see whether the prosecution hassucceeded to prove that the accused persons killedthe victim Nazrul Islam,33. The prosecution has examined 15 witness-es. PW 1 Md Akbar Ali who is the father of thedeceased Nazrul Islam, PW 2 Md Helal and PW 6Ekram Hossain are eye-witnesses who accompaniedthe victim Nazral Islam. PW 4 Seraj, PW 5 BelayetAli Sheikh, PW 8 Azmot Ali Sheikh are co-villagersand PW 9, Abdul Quddus Khan is a village doctor,PW 10 Fazlul Hoque and PW 11 Md Ansar AliSheikh who went to the house of kafiluddin Biswasof village Hamichapur and saw that Nazrul Islam isdead and Helal and Ekram were injured.34. PW 3 Md Tasiruddin and PW 13 AbdulQuashem are the seizure list witnesses. PW 12 MdEjibor Ali Shah is tendered, PW 7 Md Jewel Amin,Sl of police who filled up the FIR Form. PW 14, DrMd Nuruzzaman was the medical officer, Pabnawho held the post mortem, PW 15 Abdul BatenShah is the investigating officer of this case.35. In this case PW 2 Helal and PW 6 Ekramare the only eye-witnesses and all other witnessesheard of the occurrence from them. PW 2 Helaldeposed that he is the labourer of the informant whonarrated the case to the effect that two years ago on27th Baishak at 1-00 PM, he, Ekram and Nazrulwere sleeping in the pump house at night; that hear-ing cry of Nazrul Islam he woke up and saw that20/30 men gheraoed the pump house who assaultedthem; that Nazrul Islam died at the time of Fazarprayer. He deposed no where in his deposition as towho assaulted Nazrul Islam by which he died. Hisdeposition also supported the defence plea that amob assaulted him for which he died.36. PW 6 Md Ekram Hossain like Helaldeposed that he, Nazrul Islam and Helal were sleep-ing in the pump house and at about 1-00 PM hewoke up hearing the cry of victim Nazrul Islam; thatthey were drivers of Nazrul Islam; that 8 to 10 peo-ple entered into the pump house and others wereoutside the room; that they tied the face of Nazruland Helal and brought them outside of the room;that those persons brought them to the house ofKafiluddin Biswas located at Hamchiapur; that theytold the other persons that thieves were brought onroad passing through by the side of the house ofKafiluddin Biswas and the persons present started toassault them; that he lost his sense; that Helal wasbrought to the hospital where he stayed for twodays.37. In the cross-examination, the witnessesdeposed that they were taken to the house ofKafiluddin Biswas and they were beaten there.Ekram as PW 6 stoutly deposed that he could notTecognise any accused persons as they were the menof other village. He denied the suggestion that hehas deposed falsely. If any witness tells the truth, heshould not be declared hostile. Though this witnesswas declared hostile, there is no reason to disbelievethe deposition of this witness.38. Scanning the evidence of prosecution wit-nesses, it appears that PW 2 Helal and PW 6 EkramHossain are the only eye-witnesses. PW 2, Helal,could not identify any accused persons who assault-ed the victim Nazrul Islam.39. PW 6 Ekram Hossain also could not identi-fy any accused person as they were villagers of othervillage.40. The learned trial Court found KafiluddinBiswas, Alam, Asadullah alias Asadul, Nawab aliasNubir, Shahed Ali, Ashraf, Ibrahim, Khairul,Sobhan, Rowashan, Abdul Jalil, Mohirul,Owisuddin, Azimuddin alias Azim and Farid arefound not guilty under sections 302/34,325/34 of thePenal Code. Thus we find that the learned trialCourt did not believe one part of the prosecutioncase and believed the other part.41. It appears from the evidence on record thatthe victim Nazrul Islam died at the last part of nightwhen it was dark. The recognition of the accusedPersons during last part of night is very much doubt-ful, rather it is impossible. In this respect we mayfurther add here that the prosecution failed to comewith a lunar calendar to show that the night of occur-            rence was moonlight night. So, the re-cognition ofthe accused in such dark night is quite impossible.We find supports of the above view in the case ofAnnaddi alias Avenuddin vs State reported in 6 BLC310.42. In a criminal case the accuseds are notrequired to set up their case in writing, such as awritten statement of the defendant of a civil suit, norare they required to give evidence to prove theirinnocence, or even to establish their pleas, except aspecial plea within the meaning of section 105 of theEvidence Act and it is entirely for the prosecution toestablish the guilt of the accuseds. Defence case hasbeen made out by cross-examining the prosecutionwitnesses and making suggestions and whendefence version gets support from the prosecutionwitnesses and attending circumstances which maybe sufficient for their acquittal. Defence may put toprosecution witness any suggestion they think prop-er and the accused may take any pleas includinginconsistent pleas and for such inconsistent pleas,the defence case will not be affected. Even if bothsuch pleas are rejected by Court as not established,still he has a right to acquittal if the prosecution evi-dence is not sufficient to prove his guilt beyond rea-sonable doubt. Or if the accused may plead just notguilty and remain silent all through. But nothingadverse therefrom can be presumed against him.Whether his pleas are established or not and whetherhe leads evidence or not that is not material. Thecardinal principle of criminal justice that theaccused shall be presumed to be innocent until hisguilt is proved shall be followed at all stages of thetrial.43. In the instant case, the defence has got sup-port from the prosecution witnesses and from theattending circumstances. Here in this case, PW 2Helal and PW 6 Ekram Hossain are the only eye-witnesses who accompanied the deceased NazrulIslam but Helal could not specify any accused whoassaulted deceased Nazrul Islam and Ekram alsocould not recognise any accused. Thus the prosecu-tion has totally failed to prove its case.44, It is not possible to arrive at any conclu.sion without assessing the entire evidence of bothsides. Court is to consider the evidence of prosecu-tion witnesses along with all other evidence and cir-cumstances appearing in the case and only then theCourt can be in a position to weigh the testimonyand probabilities with the requisite decree of thor-oughness before reaching its conclusion.45. In the instant case, if we place defence ver-sion and its supporting evidence and circumstancesand the prosecution case side by side in order toarrive at a correct decision, it will appear to us thatthe defence version of the case will come out promi-nently in order to defeat the prosecution case but thelearned trial Court did not virtually consider thedefence version. If the defence put forward an alibion behalf of the accused which seems to be true, theaccused is entitled to a verdict of benefit of doubt.There is a basic rule of criminal jurisprudence that iftwo views are possible on the evidence adduced in acase of circumstantial evidence, one pointing to theguilt of the accused and the other to his innocence,the Court should adopt the view favourable to theaccused. In the instant case, if we consider theentire evidence we can safely conclude that theProsecution has totally failed to prove its case,moreso, the version put forward by the defence hasa reasonable possibility of being true. Hence theaccused is entitled to get benefit of doubt not as amatter of grace but as a matter of right.46. In our country a witness has a tendency toexaggerate, embroider and to implicate someonefalsely out of grudge and enmity. Justice is a divinefunction and the Court dispensing justice dischargesdivine functions. The Court is to examine the entireevidence carefully and must distinguish the chafffrom the grain. The entire evidence is to be tested,scrutinised and assessed along with circumstancesin order to disengage the truth from falsehood. It isnot justified to convict a man merely on surmise andconjecture. On a careful scrutiny of the evidence ofprosecution witnesses, it appears to us that the pros-ecution evidence are full of discrepancies and incon-            sistencies and these evidence are unworthy of ered-it which strike at the root of the prosecution case andhave made the prosecution case doubtful.47. The learned trial Court without properlyserutinising the evidence on record convicted theaccused Atahar, Mutahar, Sohrab, Bellal, Ishaque,Babu and Karim under sections 302/34 of the PenalCode on surmise, conjecture and on emotion. Courtor Tribunal administering any judicial matter mustadminister justice according to law and must notallow itself to be influenced by emotion or personalnotion, however heinous the offence involved in thecase may be. A dispassionate and balanced approachso the vital aspect of the case and the law bearing onthe subject is a precondition for administering even-handed justice. Law, equity and good consciencedemand that justice should not only be done but itmust also be seen to have been done. The supremeconsideration for a Court of law is to do justicebetween the parties In the instant case, the prosecu-tion has hopelessly failed to prove its case beyondall shadow of doubt.48. The learned trial Court without consideringthe evidence on record erroneously convicted theaccused appellant without observing any norms oflaw.49. We find merit in the appeal.50. In the result, the appeal is allowed. Theimpugned judgment and order dated 30-3-1997passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,Pabna in Sessions Case No. 87 of 1993 is set asideand the appellants Atahar, Mutahar, Sohrab,Ishaque, Babu, Bellal and Abdul Karim alias Karimare found not guilty of the charge levelled againstthem and Atahar, Ishaque, Babu, Bellal and AbdulKarim alias Karim be set at liberty forthwith if notwanted in any other case and accused appellantsMutahar and Sohrab be discharged from theirrespective bail bond.Send down the LCR at once.Ed.HIGH COURT DIVISION(Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction)Siddiqur Rahman Miah J | Khalil @ Khalilir &Md Abdul Hafiz J man and ors.ah-AppellantJudgmentJuly 20th, 2008vsStatess..:.42 Respondent”Evidence Act (1 of 1872)Section 30The confession of an accused person againsta co-accused is not evidence in the ordinary senseof the term. Such a confession can only be usedto lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused. The judge may call in aid the confessionand use it to lend assurance to the other evidence.A confession is an admission made at any time by aheperson charged with a crime, stating or suggestioninference that he committed that crime. A confessionmust either admit in terms the offence, or at any rate sub-stantially, all the facts which constitute the offence. Inorder to decide whether a statement is confessional or not.it must be read as a whole. Prudence and justice demandthat such evidence cannot be made the sole ground of con-viction. It may be used only as a corroborative piece ofevidence. The rule of prudence does not require that eachand every circumstance mentioned in the confession withregard to the participation of the accused person in thecrime must be separately and independently corroborated,nor is it essential that the corroboration must come fromfacts and circumstances discovered after the confessionwas made, Deliberate and voluntary confessions of guilt.if clearly proved, are among the most effectual proofs inlaw. The Court should apply two tests.Is it Voluntary? Is it true?On scrutiny of the confessional statements made bythe accused Abul Hossain, Azad Hossain Lalu andAzimuddin it appears that the confessional statements aretrue and voluntary. $7)*Criminal Appeal Nos. 3698, 3282 and 3604 of 2001.            Ustar Ali vs State 3 BLC (AD) 53 ref.Aminul Hug Helal with Mamtaz Uddin Fakir andKalipada Mridha, Advocates-—For the Appellants,Umme Kulsum Begum, Deputy Attorney-Generalwith SM Shahjahan Kabir, Assistant Attorney-General—For the State Respondent.JudgmentSiddiqur Rahman Miah J: These criminalappeals being No, 3698 of 2001 at the instance ofaccused Khalil @ Md Khalilur Rahman; CriminalAppeal No, 3282 of 2001 at the instance of MdMoazzem Hossain and Criminal Appeal No. 3604 of2001 at the instance of accused Nurul Islam undersection 408 of the Code of Criminal Procedure aredirected against the judgment and order of convic-tion and sentence dated 31-7-2001 passed by thelearned Assistant Sessions Judge, First Court,Naogaon in Sessions Case No. 51 of 1998 convict-ing the appellant Khalil @ Md Khalilur Rahman,Moazzem Hossain and Nurul Islam and others undersection 395 of the Penal Code sentencing each ofthem to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten)years and to pay a fine of Taka 5000 in default tosuffer rigorous imprisonment for 3(three) monthsmore.2. These appeals having sprouted up out ofthe common Judgment dated 31-7-2001 in SessionsCase No. 51 of 1998 arising out of Porsha PoliceStation Case No. 1 dated 11-12-1994 and, as such,these appeals are being heard and are being disposedof by this single Judgment.3. The prosecution case, in short, is that, on10-12-1994 the informant Md Moslem Uddin(Officer-in-Charge Saraigachhi Food Godown) aftercompleting his official duty at about 2-00 PM helocked up the said godown's door and handed overall responsibility to one Rezaul Karim who is theguard of the godown; that on the following day atabout 8-00 AM the informant came to know fromSharudar Ekram that 10/12 unknown persons com-mitted dacoity at Food godown at about 1-00 atnight; that thereafter the informant went to the saidgo down and found that the door of the go down No,3 was broken and that the dacoits took away 12>bags of rice from the go down and the price of thelooted goods is about Taka 1,10,678.40. It is furtherstated that after completing dacoity, the dacoits wentto Saraigachhi road and thereafter, guard and sweep.cr informed the same to local people about the inci.dent and that thereafter the local people and policevisited the place of occurrence and then informantlodged the FIR.4. SI Saidur Rahman, took up the investiga.tion, visited the place of occurrence, prepared thesketch map with separate index of the place ofoccurrence, examined the witnesses and recordedtheir statements under section 161 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure and collected alamats,Thereafter he submitted charge sheet being No. §dated 8-3-1996 against the accused persons undersections 395/412 of the Penal Code since the primaJacie case was made out against them.5. After filing of the charge sheet, the casewas transmitted to the learned Sessions Judge,Naogaon which was registered as Sessions Case No.51 of 1998 and thereafter the case was transferred tothe learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Naogaon, whoon the basis of the materials available on record |framed charge against the accused persons undersections 395/412 of the Penal Code and read it overto the accuseds present in open Court to which theypleaded not guilty and demanded trial.6. The prosecution examined 14 witnesseswho are cross-examined by the defence.7. After close of examination of the prosecu-tion witnesses, the accused persons were examinedunder section 342 of the Code of CriminalProcedure to which they repeated their innocenceand the defence did not adduce any evidence ontheir behalf.8. The defence case, as it transpires from thetrend of cross-examination of the PWs and the sug-gestions put to the witnesses, in short, is that they            are innocent. The further defence case is that theinformant in collusion with the sweeper and nightquand misappropriated 122 bags of rice and theaccused persons have been falsely implicated tosave themselves,9. Onconsideration of the evidence on recordgs well as the facts and circumstances of the case,the leamed Assistant Sessions Judge, Naogaonfound the accuseds Nurul Islam, Khalil @ KhalilurRahman and Moazzem Hossain and 14 others guiltyunder sections 395/412 of the Penal Code and con-yicted them thereunder to suffer rigorous imprison-ment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Taka 5000 indefault to suffer rigorous imprisonment for threemonths more.10. The accused appellants being aggrieved byand dissatisfied with the conviction and sentencedated 31-7-2001 passed by the learned AssistantSessions Judge, Naogaon in Sessions Case No. 51 of1998 have come up with these appeals.11. Mr Aminul Huq Helal, the learnedAdvocate appeared on behalf of the appellant Khalil@ Md Khalilur Rahman in Criminal Appeal No.3698 of 2001, Mr Mamtaz Uddin Fakir, the learnedAdvocate appeared on behalf of the appellant MdMoazzem Hossain in Criminal Appeal No. 3282 of2001 and Mr Kalipada Mridha, the learnedAdvocate appeared on behalf of the appellant MdNurul Islam in Criminal Appeal No. 3604 of 2001and took us through the FIR, charge sheet, charge soframed, the deposition of the prosecution witnessesand the impugned judgment and the materials avail-able in the paper book and submit that the appellantsare innocent; that the informant in collusion with thesweeper and night guard misappropriated 122 bagsof rice and that they have falsely implicated them inorder to save themselves. They further submit thatthe trial Court failed to consider the evidence; that/no independent and disinterested witnesses came todepose in support of the prosecution case and thewitnesses who deposed are interested and partisanwitnesses and that the Court below illegally con-victed the appellants on the basis of confessionalstatements of the co-accused, ‘They further submitthat the confessional statements have not been cor-roborated by the evidence of independent witnessesand that the prosecution failed to prove theagainst the accused beyond all reasonable doubtthat the impugned judgment and order of convictionand sentence is bad in law as well as on fact and, assuch, the impugned judgment and order is liable tobe set aside.12. Mr Aminul Huq Helal, the learnedAdvocate for the appellant, cited the decision in thecase of Ustar Ali vs State reported in 3 BLC (AD) 53in support of his contention.13. Mrs Umme Kulsum Begum, learnedDeputy Attorney-General along with Mr SMShahjahan Kabir, the learned Assistant Attorne:General, for the State, on the other hand, submitsthat the prosecution has proved its case against theappellants by most consistent, corroborative, over-whelming and competent witnesses; that the leamedAssistant Sessions Judge, is quite justified in con-victing and sentencing the appellants on the basis ofthe most cogent and reliable evidence and that theconfessional statements are corroborated by the evi-dence of other independent witnesses and that hisjudgment does not suffer from any misreading andnon-reading of evidence. She further submits thatall the prosecution witnesses are natural, probableand competent witnesses and there is no internalpoints of falschood in their evidence on any pointand, as such, the impugned judgment calls for nointerference by this Court.14. The only point for determination in theseappeals is, whether the learned Assistant SessionsJudge, Naogaon was justified in convicting and sen-tencing the accused appellants under section 395 ofthe Penal Code.15. In the face of arguments advanced by thelearned Advocates of the contending parties, we arenow called upon to scrutinise the material evidenceon record in order to come to a proper decision inthese appeals.            16. PW 1, Md Moslem Uddin is the Officer-in-Charge, Saraigachhi Food Godown, He corroborat-ing the FIR case deposed to the effect that a gang ofdacoits numbering 10/12 committed dacoity in thegodown No. 3 in the night following 10-12-94 at 10-00 PM and looted away 122 bags of rice; the dacoitsloaded the rice in a truck and went towards Sapahar;that they committed dacoity fastening the hands andlegs of night guard and sweeper; that each bag con-tains 80 Kgs and price of rice of cach bag stands atTaka 3908 and thus the price of rice of 122 bags.stands at Taka 1,10,678.40; that after the departureof the dacoits, the night guard and sweeper unfas-tening themselves, came to the locality andinformed the matter to Nur Mohammad Master,Shahjahan, Azimuddin, Kalim Uddin and later onthey informed the matter to the informant wholodged the FIR.17. He further deposed that police seized threepieces of saries, 3 pieces of chadors, some ropeattached with paper, lace of mosquito net, two bro-ken 'globe' Chinese locks, a bended Kora, ete in hispresence through a seizure list Exhibit 2 and his sig-nature therein is marked Exhibit 2/1.18. He stated in his cross-examination that hekept rice of Helal Rice Mills in godown No. 3; thatcounting the looted bags, he filed ejahar, that he iden-tified the seized articles which are marked materialExhibits I, II, II] and IV; that police recovered 93 bagsof rice and seized the same through seizure list.19. He denied the defence suggestion that nodacoity was committed and that the informant incollusion with night-guard and sweeper misappro-priated the alleged rice.20. PW 2, Md Rezaul Karim, is one of thenight guards who deposed that in the night follow-ing 10-12-1994 at about 10-00 PM while he was onduty, he saw a truck with some persons and theninformed the matter to sweeper Naimuddin; that,hurriedly some dacoits entering into the godownpremises and tied their hands and legs and kept themat the OC's residence and threatened them not toraise alarm; that they heard the sound of breakingthe lock and sound of truck; that after the departure ofdacoits, they saw that the lock is broken and thedacoits looted away some bags of rice and heinformed the occurrence to Ahmed Ali and others andthat thereafter he, Tuku and Zahurul went to localpolice station and informed the matter to the police.21. PW 3, Mosleuddin, is the Imam of localmosque who deposed that occurrence took place in thenight following on 10-12-1994; that he resided withingodown premise; that he heard the sound of enteringof a truck in the godown premises, that he tried tocome out from the room but his room was closed fromoutside; that when Rezaul and Naimuddin opened thedoor from outside, then he came and saw the occur-rence and informed the matter to the local peoplethrough the mike of mosque and thereafter the localpeople came and saw the occurrence.22. PW 4, Mohammad Ali, is a local person,who deposed that in the next morning of occurrence,he went to the place of occurrence and saw a brokenlock of the door of godown No. 3 and after somedays he came to know that some bags of rice wererecovered from Shantahar.23. PW 5, Naimuddin, was tendered by theprosecution and the defence declined to cross-exam-ine him.24. PW 6, Md Helal Uddin, deposed that he isarice merchant and he supplied rice to food go downin the year 1994.25. PW 7, Md Mahbubuzzaman, deposed thatpolice seized some articles from food go down in hispresence through a seizure list marked Exhibit 2 andhis signature therein is marked Exhibit 2/1.26. PW 8, Md Shahiduzzaman, is a Magistrate,First Class, Naogaon. He testified that on 14-12-1994 he recorded the confessional statements ofaccused Azad Hossain alias Lalu and of accusedAbul Hossain on 5-1-1995, that he also recorded theconfessional statement of accused Azimuddin undersection 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure andthat he identified the statements which are markedExhibits 3, 4 and 5,            27. In the cross-examination, he stated that theconfessional statements were taken observing. alllegal formalities. He denied the defence suggestionthat the confessional statements were obtainedthrough torture and coercion and that they did notconfess voluntarily.28. PW 9, Mustafizur Rahman, deposed that hecairies on rice business taking the godown ofAzimuddin on rental ba:29. When he deposed that police did not seizeany tice from his godown, this witness was declaredhostile,30. In the cross examination, he denied theprosecution suggestion that police seized 95 bags ofrice in his presence, in the body of seized rice bagsthere is written Saraigachhi Food Godown. Headmitted his signature in the seizure list.31. PW 10, Mohammad Alam, and PW 11, MdBablu, were tendered and the defence also declinedto cross-examine them,32. PW 12, SI Saidur Rahman, is the investi-gating officer who deposed that taking the task ofinvestigation, he visited the place of occurrence,prepared the sketch map with separate index there-of, recorded the statements of the witnesses undersection 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure andplaced accused Abul Hossain, accused Emran Aliand Azimuddin for recording their confessionalstatements by the Magistrate. He further testifiedthat the looted goods were recovered by the Officer-in-charge, Naogaon and that finding prima faciecase, he submitted charge sheet being No. 2 dated 7-11-1994 against the accused persons under sections395/412 of the Penal Code.33. In the cross-examination, he categoricallystated that the dacoits looted 122 bags of rice fromgodown No, 3; there is a mentioning of Helal RiceMill and WQCP in the bag and that 16.55 metrictonnes of rice were recovered from accusedAzimuddin in his presence.34. He denied the defence suggestion that theinformant in collusion with Night Guard andWe 40Sweeper misappropriated the alleged rice and thatthe informant filed the case against the asons on false plea in order to save them35. PW 13, ASI Md Zahirul Hoque, who veri-fies the names and addresses of Bachehu Miah andothers and their antecedents but found no othercases excepting the case under review,36. PW 14, Inspector Ruhul Amin who wasOfficer-in-Charge Nogoaon Police Station on 12-12-1994. He deposed that getting a message fromPorsha Police Station regarding dacoity ofSaraigachhi Food Godown, he searched the matterand came to know that dacoits kept the looted rice inthe rice mill of Mustafizur Rahman and the ricé millis located at New Sahapur under Naogaon policestation. He making a GD No. 367 dated 12-12-1994went there and came to know that the godown ofthat mill was owned by Azimuddin on rental basis.He testified that they recovered and seized 92 baysof looted rice from north, south side of that godownas per the pointing out of Azimuddin in presence ofMd Alam and Bablu; that they arrested Azimuddinthrough seizure list that there is writing ofSaraigachhi Food Godown on each bag of 1993-1994; that the seizure list is marked Exhibit 3 andhis signature is marked as Exhibit 3/1; that onenquiry, accused Azimuddin confessed his guilt andas per his Statement he arrested accused AzadHossain and Mokbul and that he handed over theaccuseds and the looted goods to the Officer-in-Charge, Porsha Police Station.37. He stated in his cross-examination thataccused Azimuddin told him that he purchased theseized rice.38. These are all the evidence adduced by theprosecution.of Criminalthing39. Fundamental _ principleJurisdiction is that onus of proving everessential to the establishment of chargeaccused lies upon the prosecution which must provecharge substantially as laid down i.e, to prove to the            hilt beyond all reasonable doubt on strength of clear,cogent, credible and unimpeachable evidence.Proof of charge must depend upon judicial evalua-tion of totality of evidence, oral and circumstantial,and not by an isolated scrutiny of evidence.Prosecution version is, also required to be judgedtaking into account the overall circumstances ofcase with a practical, pragmatic and reasonableapproach in the appreciation of evidence. It isalways to be remembered that the graver the charge,the greater is the standard of proof required.The doctrine of Presumption of Innocence isalways in favour of accused. The accused personmust be presumed to be innocent until the guilt isproved by cogent and credible evidence.40. A Judge does not preside over a CriminalTrial merely to see that no innocent person is pun-ished. A judge also presides to see that a guilty mandoes not escape. Both are public duties. A judge isto sift grain out of chaff, Therefore, he cannot affordany favour other than truth and only the truth,41. In the touchstone of above stated principlesof Criminal Jurisprudence, the points formulated arebeing addressed.42. It appears that convict appellants NurulIslam, Khalil @ Md Khalilur Rahman and MdMoazzem Hossain were convicted under section395 of the Penal Code.43. For better appreciation, let us reproducesection 395 of the Penal Code in the following lines:Section 395; Punishment for Dacoity—whoever commits dacoity shall be punishedwith imprisonment for life or with rigorousimprisonment for a term which may extend toten years, and shall also be alible to fine."44. There are three ingredients of this section:1. Five or more persons were jointly con-cerned in the crime.2. One or more out of them committed orattempted to commit robbery.3. Others were present and aided the com-mission or attempt to commit robbery.45, Now let us see whether the charges ofoffence under section 395 of the Penal Code havebeen substantiated in view of the evidence on recordand in the light of principles of law formulatedunder this section.46. The allegations against the convict appel-Jants are that they along with others committeddacoity in No. 3 godown of Saraigachhi FoodGodown in the night following 10-12-1994 andlooted away 122 bags of rice worth Taka1,10,678.40.47. There is no mentioning of names of theaccused persons in the FIR.48. The accused Abul Hossain, Azimuddin andMd Azad Hossain Lalu made confessional state-ments implicating some accused persons.49. Accused Abul Hossain who is a truck driv-er made confessional statement on 14-12-1994before Md Shaiduzzaman, Magistrate, First Class,narrating that accused Khalilur Rahman and Emranasked him to arrange some labourers to give a tripand accordingly, he arranged Lalu, Akram, Rustomand Samad and started for Naogaon for giving trip.On the way 4/5 persons got up in the truck and asper their directions, they placed the truck at the doorof Godown No. 3 Saraigachhi Food Godown andthey took about 100/120 bags of rice and unloadedthe rice in the rice mills of Azimuddin.50. Azad Hossain Lalu is another confessingaccused who is one of the labourers of that truckwho corroborating Abul Hossain gave the same ver-sion,51. Accused Azimuddin is another contesaccused who is a rice merchant. He made a conte:sional statement that he purchased 99 bags of ricefrom Imran through his relative Moazzem Hossainpaying Taka 90,500.52. PW 8, Md Shahiduzzaman, Magistrate,First Class, Naogaon deposed that observing all            legal formalities, he recorded the confessional state-ments of accused Azad Hossain Lalu and AbulHossain on 14-12-1994 and also recorded the con-fessional statement of accused Azimuddin on 5-1-1995 under section 164 of the Code of CriminalProcedure which are made Exhibits 3, 4 and 5 andhe also identifies his signatures therein. He furtherdeposed that the confessional statements are volun-tary and on inquiry, they replied that nobody tor-tured them and that the confessional statements aretrue and voluntary.53. The confession of an accused personagainst a co-accused is not evidence in the ordinarysense of the term. Such a confession can only beused to lend assurance to other evidence against aco-accused. The judge may call in aid the confessionand use it to lend assurance to the other evidence.54. According to section 24 of the EvidenceAct, a confession by an accused is irrelevant if it iscaused by inducement, threat or promise.55. A confession is relevant—(1) if it is made after the impression causedby any such inducement, threat or promise hasbeen fully removed.(2) if it is not made to a police officer; or(3) if it is made in the presence of aMagistrate when the accused is in the custodyof a police officer.56. A confession is an admission made at anytime by a person charged with a crime, stating orSuggesting the inference that he committed thatcrime. A confession must either admit in terms theoffence, or at any rate substantially, all the factswhich constitute the offence. In order to decidewhether a statement is confessional or not, it mustbe read as a whole. Prudence and justice demandthat such evidence cannot be made the sole groundof conviction. It may be used only as a corrobora-tive piece of evidence. The rule of prudence doesnot require that each and every circumstance men-tioned in the confession with regard to the participa-tion of the accused person in the crime must be sep-arately and independently corroborated, nor is itessential that the corroboration must come from factsand circumstances discovered after the confessionwas made. Deliberate and voluntary confessions ofguilt, if clearly proved, are among the most effectualproofs in law. The Court should apply two tests.57. Is it voluntary? Is it true?On scrutiny of the confessional statementsmade by the accused Abul Hossain, Azad HossainLalu and Azimuddin it appears that the confessionalstatements are true and voluntary.58. PW 8 Shahiduzzaman, Magistrate, FirstClass, stoutly testified that the confessionalStatements of the accused persons are voluntary andon enquiry accused persons clearly stated that theyare not tortured by the police, so it is clearlyrevealed that confessional statements are true andvoluntary.59. Now let us see whether the charges againstthe convict appellants, namely Khalilur Rahman,Moazzem Hossain and Nurul Islam, have been provedin view of evidence and confessional statements.60. It appears from evidence on record thatingredients of section 395 of the Penal Code havebeen proved, because it appears from the evidencethat 5 or 6 persons jointly committed the crime andsomeone or more out of them committed or attempt-ed to commit robbery, others were present and aidedthe commission of dacoity.61. It is to be seen who amongst the appellantspated in the commission of dacoity.parti62. On perusal of the record, it appears that theconfessing accused Azad Hossain Lalu, AbulHossain and Azimuddin are not the appellants. Itappears that confessing accused Azimuddin hasbeen acquitted by the trial Court.63. No confessing accused mentioned thename of Nurul Islam in their confessional statement.There is no other evidence on record to connect himwith the occurrence. So he should be acquitted tromthe charge.            64. As regards the allegation against the con-vict appellant Moazzem Hossain, there is a solitaryevidence that the accused Azimuddin purchased thelooted rice from accused Imran through his relativeaccused Moazzem Hossain. No other witness hasmentioned his name any where in the evidence. Sosuch solitary evidence of confessing accused with-out any corroboration cannot be the basis of convic-tion. So he should be acquitted.65. Now let us see the evidence against theconvict appellant Khalil @ Khalilur Rahman.66. The confessing accused Abul Hossain whois the truck driver clearly stated in his confessionalstatement that the accused Khalil @ KhalilurRahman and Nurul Islam asked him to arrange somelabourers to give trip and accordingly he arrangedLalu, Akram, Rustom and Samad and they startedfor Naogaon as per their direction for giving the tripof goods and they placed the truck at the door of thegodown No. 3 Saraigachhi and they took away100/120 bags of rice and unloaded the rice in themill of accused Azimuddin. Confessing accusedLalu who is one of the labourers of the said truckcorroborated the confessional statement of AbulHossain stating that as per the direction of Khalilalias Khalilur Rahman and Nurul Islam, they placedthe truck at the door of Godown No. 3, Saraigachhiand took away 100/120 bags of rice and unloadedthe same in the rice mill of accused Azimuddin. Theconfessing accused Azimuddin, in his confessionalstatement, stated that he purchased 90 bags of ricefrom Imran through his relative Moazzem payingTaka 90,500.67. Thus, it clearly appears from the aboveconfessional statements that Khalil @ Md KhalilurRahman directly participated in the commission ofdacoity and under his direction and presence, thedacoity was committed.68. It further appears from the evidence of PW14 Investigating Officer, Ruhul Amin who was offi-cer-in-charge of Naogaon Police Station that gettingthe message from Porsha police station regardingdacoity of Saraigachhi Food Godown, he searchedthe matter and came to know that looted goods werekept in the rice mill of Mustafizur Rahman locatedat Sahapur under Naogaon police station. He furtherdeposed that getting such information he along withhis force went to the godown of that mill and recov-ered and seized 92 bags of looted rice from the northand south sides of godown in presence of Alam andBablu. He further testified that there is writing ofSaraigachhi Food Godown on each bag and that heseized the looted rice. Thus it appears from theabove evidence on record that the contents of con-fessional statements are directly corroborated by therecovery and seizing of looted rice of SaraigachhiFood Godown with label and marks of that godown,which cannot be denied at all. Generally dacoity isa very heinous crime, particularly dacoity in theinstant case is more serious because it is the dacoityin the government store which has been proved byconfessional statements of three co-accused andwhich have been corroborated by direct evidence ofrecovery of looted rice. The leamed Advocate forthe convict appellant fervently argued for decreas-ing the term of punishment. Since allegation ofdacoity against appellant Khalil @ Khalilur Rahmanhas been proved beyond reasonable doubt, we donot fee inclined to decreasing the term of punish-ment in such heinous crime like dacoity in the gov-ermment store.69. In the light of the above mentioned factsand circumstances of the case and evidence onrecord, we are of the view that the allegation againstaccused Khalil @ Khalilur Rahman has been provedbeyond all reasonable doubt.70. Regard being had to the facts and circum-stances of the case, we are of the view that theCriminal Appeal No. 3282 of 2001 filed byMoazzem Hossain and Criminal Appeal being No.3604 of 2001 filed by Nurul Islam succeed andCriminal Appeal No. 3698 of 2001 filed by Khalil@ Khalilur Rahman fails.71. In the result, Criminal Appeal Nos. 3282 of2001 and Criminal Appeal 3604 of 2001 are allowedand Criminal Appeal No. 3698 of 2001 is dismissed.|            The judgment and order of conviction and sentencedated 31-7-2001 is set aside in respect of appellantsMd Moazzem Hossain and Nurul Islam andaffirmed against appellant Khalil @ Md KhalilurRahman. The appellants Md Moazzem Hossain andNurul Islam are found not guilty under section 395of the Penal Code and they are acquitted from thecharge levelled against them and discharged fromtheir respective bail bond. The appellant Khalil @Md Khalilur Rahman is found guilty under section395 of the Penal Code and his conviction and sen-tence is affirmed and he will get benefit of section35A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Send down the LCR at once.Ed.HIGH COURT DIVISION(Criminal Revisional Jurisdiction)AKM Asaduzzaman J | Nurun Nabi (Md)..Md Rezaul Hasan ].........

The case of the complainant-opposite partyNo. 1, in short, is that the complainant has filed apetition of complaint before the Chief MetropolitanMagistrate, Dhaka against the petitioner, on 3-6-2007, under section 138 of the Negotiable Instru-ments Act, 1881 (The NI Act) stating that, the, com-plainant is an established businessman of rod andcement. The accused petitioner is the proprietor ofMessrs Global Intemational and used to purchaserod and cement from the complainant and in thecourse of business they got acquainted with eachother. Taking advantage of this acquaintance, theaccused had been able to earn trust of the com-plainant. In this way the accused petitioner, on dif-ferent dates, took on credit rod and cement from thecomplainant worth Taka 13,74,429 and to dischargethe said liability the accused-petitioner had drawn 3cheques numbering 2172956, 2172957 and 2172958dated 19-12-2006, 24-12-2006 and 30-3-2007respectively, in favour of the complainant, for anamount of Taka 12,84,600 in total. The chequeswere presented for encashment on different dates,but the same were dishonoured for insufficientfunds and the fact of repeated dishonour of thecheques were duly informed to the accused-petition-er. The cheques were lastly dishonoured on 3-4-2007 and 15-4-2007. Hence, the complainant hadissued, upon the accused, a demand notice dated 19-4-2007, under section 138 of the NI Act, anddemanded payment of Taka 12,84,600, being theamount due under the said 3(three) cheques, within30 days of the receipt of the demand notice, hencethe complainant filed on 3-6-2007, a petition undersection 138 of the NI Act.3. Upon receiving the complaint petition theChief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka took cog-nizance of the case on 3-6-2007, against the peti-tioner, under section 138 of the NI Act. Thereafterthe accused petitioner surrendered on 19-12-2007before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka,and obtained bail.sion Judge, Dhaka wherein,it has been registered as Sessions Case No. 790 of2008 and the case was ultimately sent to the learnedJoint Metropolitan Sessions Judge, 5th Court,Dhaka for trial.5. The said transferee Court has framed ;charge against the accused-petitioner under section;138 and 141, Negotiable Instruments Act fixing |].8-2008 for hearing. At this stage the accused-peti.tioner has moved the above mentioned petitionunder section 561A of the Code of Crimina|Procedure and obtained the instant Rule.6. Dr Rafiqur Rahman, the learned Senio;Counsel, appearing for the accused-petitioner main.ly submits that the complainant having served singl,notice dated 19-4-2007 for 3(three) cheques, hencethe proceedings initiated thereupon is not sustain.able in law and that the continuation of the saidproceedings under section 138 of the Negotiabl;instruments Act is a sheer abuse of the process o/the Court. In support of his contention, the learnedCounsel has cited before us an unreported decisiongiven by another bench of the High Court Divisio;in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 15742 of2005.7. Mr SM Shahjahan along with Mr MéShafiqur Rahman, learned Advocates appearing forthe opposite party No. | drawing our attention tothecomplaint petition, annexed as Annexure-"A" to thepetition under section 561A, mainly submits théthere is no legal bar under section 138 of theNegotiable Instruments Act in issuing a singlenotice for dishonor of 3(three) cheques or in lodgin:a single petition of complaint, if the demand made inthe said notice is not satisfied within the statutoyperiod of 30 days of receiving the notice. He alsosubmits that, all the 3(three) cheques were present-ed for honour well within time, that is betorebecoming stale and the notice of demand, as con-templated under section 138(1)(b), has also beenissued well within the statutory period and that            thereafter the complaint petition has also beenlodged as per section 141(1) of the NI Act within thetime preseribed by the law, He further submits thatin this case, a single notice of demand being servedfor all the 3(three) cheques and the demand being.mt satisfied, there has arisen a single cause of actionfur lodging a single complaint, as contemplatedwiler section 141(1) of the Negotiable Instrumentsact. As such, there was no illegality in lodging onecomplaint petition based on the single cause ofis therefore, not liable tojon and the proceedbe quashed8. The learned Advocate also submits that, theproceeding before this Court under section 561A ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure has been initiatedfor callatal purpose to cause delay in the disposal ofthe complaint petition pending before the trialCourt, not to secure ends of justice. As such theaccused-petitioner has not come in clean hands andhe is not entitled to have any shelter of this Courtunder section 561A, In support of his contention,the leamed Counsel has cited the case betweenZahid Hossain vs State, reported in 61 DLR 386.9. Point for decisions in this case is, whetherfiling of the complaint based on single notice for3 (three) cheques and continuation of the proceed-ings under section 138 of the Negotiable Instru-ments Act amounts to abuse of the process of theCour.10. It appears that, to secure payment of hisbusiness liability, the accused has drawn, in favourof the complainant 3(three) cheques, Nos. 2172956,2172957 and 2172958 and dated on 19-12-2006, 24-12-2006 and 30-3-2007 respectively. All thesecheques were placed several times for honour andfinally on 3-4-2007 and 15-4-2007, but each timethe cheques were dishonoured for insufficient fund.11. Thereafter, a single notice demanding pay-nent of the total amount of the 3(three) cheques,mounting to Taka 12,84,600, was issued on 19-4-007, as per clause (b) of section 138 (1) of the NI\c, within the statutory period. But the accused‘failed to make the payment of the said amountfof Taka 12,84,600, within 30 days, in spite of hishaving received the notice.12. Hence, the complainant has filed a petitionof complaint under section 138(1) of NegotiableInstruments Act on 3-6-2007, before theChief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka, which has,in due course, been transmitted before the JointMetropolitan Sessions Judge, Court No. 5, Dhakafor trial and the case was fixed for hearing, when theabove mentioned application under section 561Ahas been filed seeking quashment of the impunedarmedproceedings.13. It further appears from the complaint peti-tion thus annexed that, the said 3(three) chequesbeing dishonoured for insufficiency of fund, a singlenotice of demand had been issued upon the accused,well within time, as per clause (b) of sub-section (1)of section 138 of the NI Act, and the accused, be:the drawer of the cheque, having failed to make thepayment of the "said amount of money" to thepayee, (the complainant), within 30 days of receiv-ing the notice of demand, as stipulated in clause (c)of sub-section (1) of section 138, cause of action hasarisen to lodge a complaint petition as per provisionof section 141(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Actand a complaint has accordingly been filed withinthe statutory period as mentioned in clause (b) ofsection 141. As such, as it appears from record, thecomplainant has complied with all the legal formal-ities as laid down in section 138 and 141 of theNegotiable Instruments Act, for lodging the com-plaint petition. We, therefore, have found no ille-gality in lodging the complaint petition, in the man-ner as it has been filed.14. Now the only question that falls for ourdetermination is, whether a single notice can beissued for dishonour of 3(three) cheques. In otherwords, whether the initiation or continuation of theimpugned proceedings for dishonour of 3(three)cheques in any way amounts to abuse of the processof the Court,15. To arrive at our conclusion, we have con-sidered section 138 along with section 141 of the            Negotiable Instruments Act. Clauses (a) (b) and (c)of sub-section (1) of section 138 reads as follows:"(a) the cheque has been presented to thebank within a period of six months from:the date on which it is drawn or withinthe period of its validity, whichever isearlier;(b) the payee or the holder in due course ofthe cheque, as the case may be, makes ademand for the payment of the saidamount of money by giving a notice, inwriting to the drawer of the cheque,within thirty days of the receipt of infor-mation by him from the bank regardingthe return of the cheque as unpaid, and(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to makethe payment of the said amount ofmoney to the payee or, as the case maybe, to the holder in due course of thecheque, within thirty days of the receiptof the said notice."16. Looking at the provision, as laid down inclause (b), we find that the notice of demand con-templated in clause (b) requires demanding the“amount of money" due under the dishonouredcheque. Similarly, clause (c) of section 138(1), alsostipulates that if the drawer of the cheque fails tomake the payment of the "said amount of money" tothe payee, then cause of action to lodge a complaintpetition would arise. The emphasis put under clause(b) and (c), quoted above, is on the obligation of thedrawer to pay the "amount of the money" which heis liable to pay under the cheque or cheques drawnby him. No where in clause (b) or (c) of sub-section(1) of section 138 of the Act, it has been stipulatedor in any way been required that for each chequethere should be a separate notice. The expression“said amount of money", as used in clauses (b) and(c) as quoted above, may cover the amount ofmoney that may be due under only one dishonoredcheque as well as the amount of money due undermore than one dishonoured cheque. The duty of thepayee is to demand the ‘amount of money’ due tohim and that may be due under one or more than onedishonoured cheques and not to issue a separate ordistinct notice for cach dishonoured cheque, if thereare more than one such dishonoured cheques. Assuch, we are of the considered view that, in case ofdishonour of more than of cheque, it is the discretionor convenience of the payee to decide as to whetherhe should issue a single notice or more than onenotice for each cheque. This may well depend uponseveral considerations like the need of the payee, thetime gap between the cheques and the payee's desireto avoid multiplicity of proceedings, excessive legalcost and delay in the disposal of a case, etc. But, thelegislature cannot be inflicted with the intent torequire the payee to resort to multiplicity of pro-ceedings, if the payee considers one proceeding jspracticable or otherwise advisable, in case he hap-pens to be the payee of several cheques drawn in hisfavour by the same drawer. Any other interpretationof section 138 (1) of the NI Act would not only frus-trate the intent and purport of a piece of beneficiallegislation like this, rather would be absurd and con-tradictory to the express provision of section 138(1)of the Act.17. Thereafter, considering sub-section (1) ofsection 138 along with clause (b) of section 141 ofthe Negotiable Instruments Act, we further find thatclause (b) of section 141 makes provision for filingthe complaint within one month of the date onwhich the "cause of action" arises under clause (c)of section 138(1) of the Act. Apparently, this section141 also does not contemplate more than one causeof action, while it is now settled that cause of actionunder clause (c) of section 138 (1) arises once thepayee fails to pay the amount demanded within 30days of receiving the notice. Rather clause (b) ofsection 141, read with sub-section (1) of section 138of the Negotiable Instruments Act, clearly signifiesthat dishonour of a cheque per se would not bringthe drawer of the dishonoured cheque within themischief of sub-section (1) of section 138. Theremust have arisen a cause of action for taking cog-nizance under clause (1) of section 141 of the ActSuch cause of action arises upon failure of the draw-            er of cheque to make payment of "the amount ofmoney", Within 30 days of receiving the noticedemanding payment of the amount under the dis-honoured cheque and not within 30 days of dishon-our of a cheque.18. It is, therefore, abundantly clear that foreach cause of action, whether arises for failure topay the amount due under a single cheque or formore than one cheque, depending upon the amountchimed there should be a single petition of com-plaint. In this case, since, in the demand notice thetotal amount of the 3(three) cheques amounting toJoka 12,84,600 has been demanded and the drawerofthe cheque having failed to make payment of the"said amount of money" within 30 days, only onecause of action has arisen and, legally, for one causeof action there should be one complaint petition,which has exactly been done in the impugned pro-ceeding. As such, we do not find any illegality orany abuse of the process of the Court in issuing asingle notice for 3(three) cheques, as because noticehas been served and the demand has been madewithin the stipulated period of time. We also findsupport of our views from the case between StalionShox (Pvt) vs Auto Teisions (Pvt) Ltd reported in(1994) 79 Company Cases 809 (Delthi), wherein thehonourable Court has declined to quash a similarcomplaint petition under section 561A of the CrPCas because the petitioner could not point out anyprejudice to be cause to the petitioners by filing ofone complaint in respect of dishonouring of 11cheques. Besides a decision cited by the learnedCounsel for the opposite party No. 1, reported in 6/DLR 386, Zahid Hossen vs State, also supports ourview, in which the complainant issued a singlenotice of demand for 8(eight) dishonoured chequesand initiated a single proceedings and the petitionfor quashment challenging the said proceedingsfailed.19. We have also considered the unreporteddecision cited by the learned Counsel for the peti-tioner and we are unable to agree with reasoning by“eir Lordships given in the said case.sa20. Section 141, clause (c) of the NegotiableInstruments Act has provided for trial of such caseby a senior Court, namely the Court of Sessions.Thereafter, by a subsequent amendment dated 9-2-2006, the carlier section 138 A, regarding filing ofappeal against the judgment of the trial Court, hasalso been replaced and substituted by a new section138A of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In the newsection, restriction has been imposed in preferringappeal against the judgment of the trial Court.Unless an amount not less then 50% of the amountof the dishonoured cheque is deposited before filingthe appeal in the Court which awarded the sentence,no appeal would be admissible. As such, the inten-tion of the legislature is very much clear that, theNegotiable Instruments Act, being a special law andspecial provision being made to restrain lingering ofthe disposal of such cases and also to discouragepreferring frivolous appeals. This piece of legisla-tion by its nature is a beneficial one and the cheque-defaulter should not be indulged in a manner so thatthe legislative intent is allowed to be frustrated.21. We have also considered that the provi-sions regarding framing of charges has been incor-porated under Chapter XIX of the Code of CriminalProcedure. Section 225 of the Code reads as fol-lows:"225, Effect of Errors: No error in statingeither the offence or the particulars required tobe stated in the charge, and no omission to statethe offence or those particulars shall be regard-ed at any stage of the case as material, unlessthe accused was in fact, misled by such error oromission, and it has occasioned a failure of jus-tice."22. Even looking at this case from that point ofview, we do not find that the accused has in any waybeen misled or that framing of one charge for dis-honouring of 3(three) cheques, in the manner afore-said, has occasioned a failure of justice. Indeed, nosuch contention has been made before us by thelearned Counsel for the petitioner.            23. Mere contention that, an impugned pro-ceedings amounts to abuse of the process of theCourt, without there being any basis or material tosubstantiate such contention does not warrant interference by this Court under section 561A.24. Accordingly, we find no merit in this Ruleand the Rule is hereby discharged. The trial Courtis directed to proceed with the case as expeditiouslyas may be practicable.25. The order of stay granted earlier by thisCourt shall stand vacated.Communicate the order at once.Ed.HIGH COURT DIVISION(Civil Revisional Jurisdiction)SAK Md Dabirush | Jahangir Alam ChowdhuryShan J (MG) sassvcrscseesenes PetitionervsZabun Nahar ChowdhuraniJudgment and ONES cescessceseseese-Opposite Parties*May 8th, 2008Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908)Section 115The High Court Division while exercising itsrevisional jurisdiction is competent to reverse thejudgment of the Courts below when the same hasbeen made either upon mis-reading or non-con-sideration of the material evidence causing fail-ure of justice,Md Oziullah, Advocate—For the Petitioner.Abdul Kalam Chowdhury, Advocate—For OppositeParty No.*Civil Revision case 661, 662 of 2006,Mohsena Khatun vs Habib Knitting Mills 1997 BLt(AD) 47; Hussain Ahmed Chowdhury vs Md Nurul Amin47 DLR (AD) 162 and Habibullah vs Sher Ali Khan 57DUR(AD) SS ref sacal (15, 17-19)JudgmentThese two Rules in Civil Revision Nos.661 of2006 and 662 of 2006 were issued calling upon theopposite party Nos. | and 2 to show cause as to whythe judgment and decree dated 25-1-2006 and 31-}-2006 respectively passed by the learned JointDistrict Judge, Ist Court, Feni, in Title AppealNos.113 and 114 of 2004 allowing the appeals andreversing the judgment and decree dated 20-10-2004 and 27-10-2004 respectively passed by thelearned Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni, inTitle Suit Nos. 29 of 2003 and 8 of 2004 heard anal-ogously and disposed of by a single judgmentshould not be set aside.2. Since the two Rules were issued and tworevisions were filed out of same judgment let boththe Rules be disposed of by this single judgment.3. The petitioner here as plaintiff filed TitleSuit No.63 of 2003 in the Court of Assistant Judge.Feni Sadar, Feni for declaration that the gift deedNo.6457 dated 25-11-2001 registered with FeniSadar Sub-registry Office executed by the defendantNo.2 in favour of the defendant No.1 is illegal, col-lusive, void, inoperative and not binding upon him.The case was subsequently transferred to the Courtof Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni and re-num-bered as Title Suit No. 8 of 2004.4. The brief fact of the plaintiff's case is thatthe plaintiff is an eye consultant (eye specialist) ofFeni Sadar Hospital at present. The plaintitf afterpassing MBBS he joined at Kalidah Sub-Centre asMedical Officer and while serving there the father ofdefendant No.2 requested him to marry his daughteri.e. the defendant No.2, and on being satistied hegave consent and ultimately the marriage wassolemnised in 1988. During their wedlock they got            one daughter and one son, The plaintiff appeared atBCS examination of Health Cadre and qualifiedhimself and also subsequently passed FCPS in eye.As an eye specialist he earned good reputation athome and abroad. He went to Saudi Arabia throughGovernment and served there for a long time withthe satisfaction of the authority by high paid salary.He did not acquire any foreign decree as alleged bythe defendants. The father-in-law of plaintiff Dr MdJahangir Alam Chowdhury advised him through dif-ferent letters not to send money to the brothers ofMd Jahangir Alam and others because they will mis-yse his money. Then he advised his son-in-law, ifyou atall sent money for your future security he cansend it to his father-in-law and according to hisadvice he started sending money to his father-in-law. It may be mentioned here that Dr Md. JahangirAlam went to Saudi Arabia along with his wife andchildren and stayed in Saudi Arabia more than oneyear and came back again and joined at Feni SadarHospital as eye consultant. While he was serving inFeni Sadar Hospital he used to live with his wife andchildren in a rented house at Mizan Road in Fenitown and he also set up an eye clinic there. Hebrought many gold ornaments for his wife defendantNo.2 when they were coming back to Bangladesh.While he was running his practice and clinic busi-ness he asked his father-in-law to give account ofabout Taka 10 (ten) lac which was sent to him fromSaudi Arabia. His father-in-law told him that he hasinvested the money in his business and he wouldrepay the money latter on. The defendant No.2, thewife of Dr Md Jahangir Alam, was very muchannoyed and displeased with him as he asked for hismoney to his father-in-law. Thereafter the defendantNo.2 started pick to up quarrels with her husband ondifferent pleas and she became very much disobedi-ent and unloyal to her husband. While residing atMizan Road, Feni Town she used to frequently visither father's house without seeking any permissionfrom her husband and started a reckless life.Subsequently the relationship between the husbandand wife became very bitter and they used to pick-up quarrels frequently, That the plaintiff also startedgiving pressure upon his father-in-law to get backhis money. As a result the defendant No.2, the wifeof Dr Md Jahangir Alam, without seeking any per-mission went to her father's house along with herchildren and stayed some days there and again shecame to her husband's house. The defendant No.2started leading her life according to her sweet willand used to go out from her husband's house fre-quently to visit her father's house and relations’house. At last finding no other alternative, the plain-tiff sent a divorce notice to the defendant No.2 on 4-10-2001 through local Pourashava. After receipt ofthat notice a Salish was held on 18-11-2001 at oldBar Library building Feni. The Salish was presidedover by Dr Shahidullah who was the then Presidentof the Feni Doctors’ Association and in presence ofbrother of defendant No.2 Manjur Wahab and twoadvocates of Feni Bar Md Nurul Amin and MdSaidur Rahman and close relation of defendant No.2Md Zahirul Hoque and both the plaintiff and thedefendant Nos. 2 were present in the Salish. Aftermuch negotiation and also after looking at the wel-fare of the children the Salishdar came to a agree-ment to the effect that Dr Md Jahangir Alam willwithdraw his divorce notice and the defendant No.2Kamrun Nahar will make a gift of 3'/, decimal ofland in the name of her husband Dr Md JahangirAlam Chowdhury which was gifted to KamrunNahar by her father defendant No.3. Accordingly aSalishnama (Raida) was prepared but since thefather-in-law of Dr Md Jahangir Alam denied that hedid not take or receive 10 lac Taka from SaudiArabia sent by Dr Md Jahangir Alam as such it wasnot written in the Salishnama. The Salishnama wassigned by all the persons present in the Salishincluding the plaintiff and the defendant. Thereafterthe Salishnama or Raida was authenticated by aNotary Public and it was settled up in the Salish thatboth plaintiff and defendant will abide by the deci-sion of the Salish, Thereafter Dr Md Jahangir Alamon the same date withdrew his divorce notice and on29-11-2001 the defendant No.2 Kamrun Nahar exe-cuted a gift deed No. 6511 dated 29-11-2001 at FeniSub-Registry Office in presence of the attesting wit-            nesses No.1 Advocate Md Nurul Amin, Md SaidurRahman and Manjur Wahab and Kamrun Nahar wasidentified by her full brother Manjur Wahab, In pur-suance of Salishnama and gift deed subsequently DrMd Jahangir Alam constructed a three-storied build-ing and set up an eye clinic and chamber under thename and style of Feni Eye Centre in ground floorand first floor and the plaintiff along with his wifeand children used to stay on the second floor andthey were peacefully and harmoniously living there.Meanwhile after the lapse of about two years whilesettlement operation was going and the name of DrMd Jahangir Alam Chowdhury was published in thedraft khatian or Mat-parcha then a dispute case waslodged before the attestation officer by the defen-dant No.3 on behalf of defendant No.1 father-in-lawand mother-in-law to the plaintiff respectively to theeffect that the schedule land was gified to defendantNo.1 the mother of defendant No.2 Kamrun Naharby a registered gift deed No. 6457 dated 25-11-2001i.e. prior to the gift made by Kamrun Nahar to herhusband on 29-11-2001 as such the khatian cannotbe prepared in the name of Dr Md Jahangir Alam.Thereafter Dr Md Jahangir Alam gave a search inthe Sub-Registry Office, Feni to obtain the certifiedcopy of said Gift Deed No.6457 dated 25-11-2001.Meanwhile he received summons along with a copyof the plaint of Title Suit No.52 of 2003 subsequent-ly re-numbered as 29 of 2003 filed by the defendantNo.2 Kamrun Nahar.5. After going through the plaint, the plaintiffcame to realise that his wife Kamrun Nahar alongwith her father and mother only to deceive the plain-tiff fraudulently executed the gift deed beingNo.6511 dated 29-11-2001. As a matter of factKamrun Nahar made a gift deed to her mother on25-11-2001 prior to the gift executed by KamrunNahar to her husband on 29-11-2001. It may bementioned here that Dr Md Jahangir Alam mutatedhis name and obtained Kharija Khatian No.910DCR thereof, he paid the rent in his own name forthe suit land and he also submitted the constructionplan of his three-storied building before the FeniMunicipal Office and also paid municipal taxes inhis own name because the holding number was pre.pared in his name. He also obtained the trade licencefrom municipal office in his own name for setting upthe Feni Eye Centre and electric connection, tele.phone connection, every thing was made in thename of the plaintiff.6. Finding no other alternative Dr MdJahangir Alam was compelled to institute the instantSuit No.63 of 2003 re-numbered as 8 of 2004 for adeclaration to the effect that Gift Deed No.6457dated 25-11-2001 registered with Feni Sub-RegistryOffice executed by defendant No.2 in favour ofdefendant No. 1 was collusive, fraudulent, inopera-tive, void and not binding upon the plaintiff.Thereafter both the cases were heard analogously bythe learned Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feniand disposed of by a single judgment decreeing thesuit in favour of plaintiff of Title Suit No.8 of 2004and dismissed the Title Suit No.29 of 2003 by hisjudgment and decree dated 20-10-2004 and 27-10-2004.The brief fact of the Title Suit No. 29 of 2003which was instituted by the plaintiff Kamrun Naharagainst her husband Dr Md Jahangir AlamChowdhury is that the plaintiff and defendant are thehusband and wife and they got married on 11-2.1998 and they have | daughter and one son out oftheir wedlock. At the time of their marriage herfather gifted many valuable goods and articlesincluding ornaments and furnitures to the defendanthusband and his father-in-law also gave Taka $ lacto the defendant for taking higher education fromabroad. The defendant is a man of very bad naturewho always used to give pressure on her to takemoney from her father's house and used to tortureher both physically and mentally for giving himdowry. Considering the future of the plaintiff herfather made a deed of gift in the name of plaintiff on25-4-2000 measuring 3'/, decimal of land situatedat Feni town. Her father built up a 3-storied buildingwith a foundation of 5-storied building by spendinghuge amount of money and she had been livingthere with her husband and children since 2001. The            defendant again created pressure on the plaintiff totransfer the suit land to him in the name of defendantin writing in licu of dowry and when she refused todo so a notice of Talak was given upon her on 4-10-2001. The plaintiff transferred the suit land measur-ing 3'/, decimal of land to her mother by a gift deedon 25-11-2001 considering her future security andsafety in the absence of her husband, After issuanceof said Talak notice a Salish was held on 29-11-2001where it was decided to settle up the dispute and towithdraw Talak notice by the defendant and in pur-suance of that decision of Salish the defendant with-drew the notice of Talak by an affidavit and thenthey started living their conjugal life as husband andwife peacefully.7. Again the defendant told her to transfer thesuit land in the name of the defendant for runninghis practice as eye specialist and failing of which shewould be divorced. In order to maintain conjugallife peacefully and considering the future of the chil-dren she executed and registered the gift deedNo.6511 dated 29-11-2001 in favour of the defen-dant. But on the date of execution and registration ofdeed of gift she had no right and title to transfer thesuit land.But without taking any permission from his firstwife plaintiff and the concerned Pourashava, defen-dant married a girl of Dhaka named Asha andbrought in her house on 27-4-2003 and tried to staythere but she prevented them and thereafter defen-dant shifted his all machineries and equipment of hiseye clinic and chamber to a rented house and startedliving there with his second wife Asha. For that theplaintiff filed CR Case No.75 of 2003 under section6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1962 inthe Court of Magistrate, Ist Class, Feni against thedefendant but the plaintiff could not prove thecharge under section 6(5) of the Muslim FamilyLaws Ordinance of 1962 as such the case was dis-missed, Subsequently she instituted the Civil Suitbeing No.29 of 2003 on 5-6-2003 for cancellation ofgift deed dated 29-11-2001 under section 39 of theSpecific Relief Act to cancel the deed as the deedwas forged, collusive, fabricated, null, void andinoperative.8. The defendant husband Dr Md JahangirAlam Chowdhury contested the suit by filing writ-ten statement denying all the material allegationsmade in the plaint stating, inter alia, what he lystated in the plaint of his Title Suit No.63 of 2003subsequently re-numbered as 8 of 2004, Both theTitle Suit No.29 of 2003 and 8 of 2004 tried by theSenior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni and heardanalogously and disposed of by a single judgmentdated 20-10-2004.9. During the course of trial the learnedSenior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni after exam-ining the evidence on record and perusing the docu-ments and exhibits produced by both the parties insupport of their respective suits and came to hisfinding that the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 8 of 2004successfully proved the case, on the other hand, theplaintiff of Title Suit No. 29 of 2003 Most. KamrunNahar miserably failed to prove her case, as such,the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Fenidecreed the Title Suit No. 8 of 2004 in favour of theplaintiff and dismissed the Title Suit No. 29 of 2003by his judgment and decree dated 2-10-2004 and 27-10-2004 respectively,10. Being aggrieved by the judgment anddecree passed by the trial Court the defendants ofTitle Suit No. 8 of 2004 and the plaintiff of Title SuitNo. 29 of 2003 preferred 2 appeals before thelearned District Judge, Feni which were subsequent-ly heard by the Joint District Judge, Ist Court, Fenion transfer. Both the appeals were heard analogous-ly and disposed of by one judgment by the learnedJoint District Judge, Ist Court, Feni after hearingboth the appeals and their learned lawyer allowedthe appeals and set aside the judgment and decreepassed by the trial Court by his judgment and deereedated 25-1-2006 and 31-1-2006 respectively.11. Being aggrieved by and dissatistied withthe judgment and decree passed by the learned JointDistrict Judge, Ist Court Feni the defendant-respon-            y dent-petitioner of Title Suit No, 29 of 2003 andplaintif-respondent petitioner of Title Suit No, 8 of2004 Dr Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury preferredtwo revisional applications being Civil RevisionNos. 661 of 2006 and 662 of 2006 under section 115of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained thepresent Rule.12. The learned Counsel Mr Md Oziullah,appearing on behalf of the plaintiff-respondent-peti-tioner in Civil Revision No. 661 of 2006 and defen-dant-respondent-petitioner in Civil Revision No.662 of 2006 submits that the lower appellate Courtis absolutely wrong and erroneous in allowing theappeals and reversing the judgment and decreepassed by the learned trial Court, the learnedAssistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni on considerationof the evidence on records, documents, exhibits andother connected papers passed in the judgment anddecree in favour of the petitioner Dr Md JahangirAlam which was absolutely proper and justified.The learned Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram,Feni observed that the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 8 of2004 Dr Md Jahangir Alam has been able to provethe case that the deed of gift was duly executed andregistered in pursuance of terms and conditions ofSalish held in Feni Bar Association Building inpresence of the plaintiff Dr Md Jahangir Alam andhis wife defendant Most Kamrun Nahar, her brotherManjur Wahab and two Advocates Mr Md NurulAmin and Saidul Hoque of Feni Bar Association andall of them were signatories of the Salishnama.According to the decision of the Salish, plaintiff DrMd Jahangir Alam withdraw the Talak notice anddefendant Most. Kamrun Nahar also executed adeed of gift of 3'/, decimal of land and the documentwas duly registered on 29-11-2001 and the posses-sion of the suit land was also duly delivered to theplaintiff. Thereafter plaintiff Dr Md Jahangir Alamfor constructing a three-storied building submitted aplan in the Feni Municipality for approval anddeposited the necessary fees in his name and afterapproval he constructed a three storied building byhis own expense. He set up Feni Eye Clinic in theground floor of that building and set up his chambe,in the first floor and started his roaring practice andhe along with his wife and children used to live jnthe 2nd floor of the building. In this way they wereliving peacefully and harmoniously in their conjugaylife in the newly constructed house for about twoyears. Meanwhile, he has mutated his name byopening a separate khatian and by paying rent andalso a new municipal holding number was preparedin his name. Thereafter when a settlement operationwas going on an attested khatian was prepared in thename of Dr Md Jahangir Alam, a dispute case waslodged to the concerned attestation officer by thefather-in-law of Dr Md Jahangir Alam and by fatherof the defendant No. 2 to the effect that the disputedland was gifted to the mother of Kamrun Nahar on25-11-2001 by a gift deed No. 6457 by KamrunNahar as such, the subsequent gift deed executed byKamrun Nahar, the defendant No. 2 on 29-11-2001with regard to the same suit land has become infruc-tuous. The learned Counsel next submits that mean-while plaintiff of Title Suit No. 8 of 2004 receivedsummons along with a copy of the plaint of Title Suit No. 29 of 2003 wherefrom Dr Md Jahangir Alam came to realise about the dishonest and deecp-tive intention of his wife, father-in-law and motherin-law and was constrained to file the declarationsuit No. 8 of 2004. The learned trial Court after dis-cussing all the documentary evidence and the oral evidences and after applying his judicial mind and also after proper assessment of the evidence bothoral and documentary came to a correct and justified finding that if at all the another gift deed was madeby Kamrun Nahar 3 days prior to 29-11-2001 it wasdormant or sleeping deed and which was not actedupon and no delivery of possession was made assuch, by this sleeping deed no title was passed. Thelearned Counsel further submits that Kamrun Naharhas got no locus-standi to file the Title Suit No, 29of 2003 as plaintiff according to her own claim shewas no longer the owner of the suit land but hermother Zebun Nahar Chowdhurani was the properpersons to file the suit under section 39 of theSpecific Relief Act as such, the suit of Kamrun            Nahar as plaintiff is not maintainable. He also sub-mits that under section 92 of the Evidence Act thedocumentary evidence will prevail upon the oralevidence and draw the attention of the Court to therecital of the gift deed No, 6511 dated 29-11-2001wherein it has been clearly stated that the suit landwas null and vacant land. He further submits thatthe claim of the plaintiff in Title Suit No. 29 of 2003js barred by waiver and acquiescence because sheherself deposed that she had gifted the suit land inthe name of her mother prior to the gift deed exe-cuted in the name of her husband Dr Md JahangirAlam. Finally the leamed Counsel submits that thejearned lower appellate Court without discussing theevidence on record and without perusing theexhibits and documents came to a wrong and falla-cious finding being guided by emotion and senti-ment and recollecting the poem written by RabindraNath Tagore "32 faq Gf", The lower appellateCourt totally ignored the legal aspect of the case thatthe suit of the plaintiff Most. Kamrun Nahar beingTitle Suit No. 29 of 2003 is not maintainable accord-ing to her own version and deposition. The lowerappellate Court in his judgment termed the gift deedexecuted by Kamrun Nahar on 25-11-2001 as secu-rity deed or as a shield against her husband. He alsosubmits that in legal proceedings there is no scopeor opportunity to do anything which is not permissi-ble by law. The lower appellate Court while allow-ing the appeals and reversing the judgment of thetrial Court is required to reverse the finding of thetrial Court with reference to the evidence on recordbut the lower appellate Court without making’suchobservation and without consideration of the docu-mentary evidence and legal aspect of the casepassed a judgment absolutely guided by emotionand sentiment and, as such, liable to be interfered bythis Court hence the Rule should be made absolute.13. On the other hand, the learned Counsel MrAbul Kalam Chowdhury with Mr AT Obaidul Hye,appearing on behalf of the opposite party No. 1, sub-mits that the lower appellate Court was absolutelycorrect and justified in allowing the appeals andreversing the judgment and decree passed by thetrial Court. In this connection he referred the casewhich was also cited in the judgment of the lowerappellate Court in Title Suit No. 29 of 2003 6 DLR(AD) 97 wherein it has been stated that:"Initial onus of undue influence is on theperson who raises the plea—Initial onus with-out discharge, the burden shifis on the otherside to prove the contrary".14. Next he submits that the lower appellateCourt rightly observed that the plaintiff of Title SuitNo. 8 of 2004 Dr Md Jahangir Alam creating pres-sure of giving notice of Talak in a deceitful mannerobtained the gift deed from his wife on 29-11-2001.This gift deed in the eye of law has got no value andliable to be cancelled under section 39 of theSpecific Relief Act. The learned Counsel finallysubmits that the lower appellate Court after consid-ering the facts and circumstances of the case andalso discussing the evidence came to a right and jus-tified finding in allowing the appeals and reversingthe judgment and decree which is not liable to beinterfered by this Court in revision under section115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.15. On a meticulous examination of therecords, exhibits, documents and the judgment ofboth the Courts below and also the connected papersit appears that the trial Court discussed the evidenceon record and also perused the documents andexhibits and considered the material evidence andmade his observation. It further appears from thejudgment of both the Courts below that the lowerappellate Court in reversing the judgment of the trialCourt did not refer the evidence on record and thecontents of the finding of the trial Court with refer-ence to the evidence on record, The decision whichwas referred by the appellate Court is not applicablein the facts and circumstances of the instant case.The lower appellate Court totally ignored the legalaspect of the case and being guided by emotion andsentiment passed the judgment of reversal withoutany cogent and justified reason or ground. Theappellate Court while reversing the judgment of thetrial Court required to reverse the material finding of            the trial Court with reference to the evidence onrecord. In this connection I like to refer the decisionin the case of Mohsena Khatun vs Habib KnittingMills reported in 1997 BLD (AD) 47 wherein it hasbeen held: "While reversing the judgment of the trialCourt the appellate Court is required to reverse thematerial findings of the trial Court with reference tothe evidence on record.”16. In judgment of the trial Court it appearsthat in its finding the said Court carefully consideredthe material evidence on record. The learned trialCourt did not commit any error of law and also com-mitted no illegality in arriving at his finding becausethe plaintiff Dr Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhurycould be able to prove the case successfully. Thelower appellate Court committed an error of law andcame to a wrong finding occasioning failure of jus-tice in not considering the documentary evidence,exhibits and other vital documents. The appellateCourt being guided by emotion and sentimentpassed the judgment without the legal basis. Theappellate Court ought to have considered whetherthe deed of gift was duly executed and registeredand acted upon and the validity of the deed of giftand also whether the title was passed by this deed ofgift or not. Without determining’ this vital legalaspect of the case the appellate Court reversed thejudgment and decree passed by the trial Court whichis liable to be set aside. In this connection I like torely on the case of Hussain Ahmed Chowdhury vsMd Nurul Amin reported in 47 DLR (AD) 162wherein it has been held :"If there is misreading of evidence andnon-consideration of some material evidencethen it was incumbent on the revisional Court toconsider the same and to arrive at a proper find-ing on the material evidence on record and tofinally dispose of the case."17. Another decision can also be cited in thecase of Habibullah vs Sher Ali Khan reported in 57DLR (AD) 55 wherein it has been stated:"The High Court Division while exercisingits revisional jurisdiction is competent toreverse the judgment of the Courts below whenthe same has been made either upon mis-read.ing or non-consideration of the material evi-dence causing failure of justice.”18. In view of the facts and legal position ofthe case I find that the lower appellate Court isabsolutely wrong in reversing the judgment anddecree passed by the trial Court, as such, the judg.ment and decree passed by the lower appellate Couris liable to be set aside.19. The discussion made above and the factsand circumstances of the case and also the legalposition of the case the impugned judgment anddecree dated 25-1-2006 and 31-1-2006 respectivelypassed by the leamed Joint District Judge, Ist Court,Feni, in Title Appeal Nos.113 of 2004 and 114 of2004 allowing the appeals and reversing the judg-ment and decree dated 20-10-2004 and 27-10-2004respectively passed by the learned Senior AssistantJudge, Parshuram, Feni, in Title Suit Nos. 29 of2003 decreeing the Title Suit No.8 of 2004 is here-by set aside and the judgment and decree passed bythe trial Court is hereby affirmed.20. In the result these two Rules are madeabsolute without any order as to the costs.21. The order of stay granted earlier by thisCourt at the time of issuance of the Rule is herebyvacated. ,Lower Courts record be sent down at once witha copy of the judgment.Ed.            HIGH COURT DIVISION(Special Original Jurisdiction)Syed Refaat Ahmed J | Ataur Rahman (Md)...Moyeenul Islam «PetitionerChowdhury J vsJudgment Bangladesh and others......February 4th, 2010, seeeeseeeeeeeeeekespondents*Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972Article 31Article 31 of the Constitution contemplatesthat (0 enjoy the protection of the law, and to betreated in accordance with law, and only inaccordance with law, is the inalienable right ofevery citizen, wherever he may be, and of everyother person for the time being withinBangladesh, and in particular no action detri-mental to the life, liberty, body, reputation orproperty of any person shall be taken except inaccordance with law.District Judges have the inalienable right to be treat-ed in accordance with the law declared by the AppellateDivision. So they have a legal right to pray for issuance ofa Writ of Mandamus and the respondent No.1 has a legalduty to comply therewith by placing the District Judgesappropriately in the Table of the Warrant of Precedence asper the dictates of the law clearly enunciated in MasdarHossain's case by the Appellate Division.Article 152(1)Warrant of Precedence—Directions—As theConstitution is the supreme law of the land, allconstitutional office-holders are to be placed firstin order of priority in the Table of the newWarrant of Precedence; Thereafter the constitu-tionally recognized and referred post-holders,namely, District Judges and Chiefs of Staff of theDefence Services of Bangladesh etc. are to beplaced in the said Table; albeit they are persons+n the service of the Republic; Members of theJudicial Service holding equivalent judicial posts*Writ Petition No.11685 of 2006.© 42of District Judges are to be paced along withDistrict Judges at the jal number of theTable; Since as per Article 152(1) of the Constitu-tion, District Judge includes Additional DistrictJudge, Additional District Judges are to beame se!placed at the serial number immediately afterthat of District Judges. see LOD)New Warrant of PrecedenceThe respondent No.1 is directed to make anew Warrant of Precedence in accordance withthe 8(eight) point directives mentioned in thebody of the judgment within a period of 60(sixty)days from the date of receipt of a copy thereofand to place the District Judges, Members of theJudicial Service holding equivalent judicial postsof the District Judges, Additional District Judges,Chief Judicial Magistrates and Chief Metropoli-tan Magistrates in appropriate places in theTable of the new Warrant of Precedence. ....(102)PrecedenceAs per the impugned Warrant of Precedence,the Table will be observed with respect to theprecedence of persons named therein. So themeaning of the word 'precedence' is very crucialrelating to the placement of the District Judges inthe said Table. 'Precedence' means the order orpriority in place or time observed by or for per-sons of different status (such as political dignitaries) on the basis of rank during ceremonialevents and another meaning of the word is gen-erally the act or state of going before somethingelse according to some system of priorities."Precedence! means priority and that priori-ly predicated uponatus' is a perty is necessarily and essentione's status.

The case of the petitioner as set out in theWrit Petition, in short, is as follows:3. The petitioner is an Additional District andSessions Judge and the Secretary-General of theBangladesh Judicial Service Association. He is @conscious citizen of Bangladesh. He is keen lvuphold the fundamental rights of the citizensenshrined in the Constitution of the People’sRepublic of Bangladesh. He has served a good            number of years in the Sub- ordinate Judiciary and isthus conscious of the dignity, prestige and honour ofthe Judiciary. He is aware of his duty as a citizen inconsonance with Article 21 of the Constitution toensure the observance of the Constitution and theJaws of Bangladesh, As a conscious member of thesociety and the Secretary-General of the BangladeshJudicial Service Association, the Petitioner feelsaggrieved by the impugned notification No. CD-10/1/8S-Rules/361 dated 11-9-1986 (Annexure-A),He has filed the Writ Petition in his capacity as aconcemed, affected and aggrieved citizen to protectthe interest of indefinite number of people ofBangladesh and, to uphold the Rule of Law by wayof public interest litigation and to prevent illegal andarbitrary placement of the members of the judicialservice and the constitutional office-holders in inap-propriate places in the Warrant of Precedence inderogation of their dignity and status in public per-ception. The petitioner being committed to the wel-fare of Republic and to uphold the Rule of Lawbrings this action "pro bono publico” challengingthe impugned Warrant of Precedence.4. In the Table of the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh beingthe head of the judicial organ has been placed atserial No.4. Some constitutional office-holders likethe Attorney-General for Bangladesh, Comptrollerand Auditor-General and Ombudsman have beenplaced at serial No.15 while the employees of theRepublic like the Cabinet Secretary, Chiefs of Staffof the Army, Navy and Air Force and PrincipalSecretary to the Government have been placed atserial No. 12 in the said Table. District Judges havebeen placed at serial No. 24 equating them withDeputy Commissioners who are the mid-levelemployees of the Republic. The impugned Warrantof Precedence does not provide for any rationalbasis and, as such, it is arbitrary. In the scheme ofour Constitution, the post the District Judge is thehighest post of the Bangladesh Judicial Service.The required qualification for appointment to thepost of the District Judge is 15(fifteen) years serviceincluding two years experience as an AdditionalDistrict Judge. However, in spite of the directionsgiven by the Appellate Division in the ease of theSecretary, Ministry of Finance vs Masdar Hossainreported in 52 DLR (AD) 82 (hereinafter referred toas Masdar Hossain’s case), the Government hasfailed to introduce a separate pay scale for the mem-bers of the Judicial Service. The initial pay scale ofa District Judge being at grade 3 of the National P:Scale of 2005 is equivalent to that of a Joint-Secre-tary to the Government. The Additional DistrictJudge is the second highest post of the JudicialService enjoying 4th grade of the said National PayScale of 2005. The members of the other tiers of theJudicial Service are Joint-District Judges, SeniorAssistant Judges and Assistant Judges.5. The Judicial Service is not 'service’ in thesense of employment. The Judges are not employ-ees. As members of the Judiciary, they exercise thesovereign judicial power similarly as the membersof the Cabinet exercise the executive power and themembers of the Legislature exercise the legislativepower of the Republic. In a democracy such as ours,the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary con-stitute the three pillars of the State and by such aconception, it is intended to be conveyed that thethree essential functions of the State are entrusted tothe three organs of the State and each one of them intum represents the authority of the State. Thosewho exercise the State-power are Ministers, Lelators and Judges and not the members of their staffwho implement or assist in the implementation oftheir decisions. So in that view of the matter, themembers of the Judicial Service cannot be equatedwith administrative executives; rather as the wield-ers of the State-power, they are on a par with politi-cal executives and legislators. Judicial independ-ence cannot be secured by making mere solemnproclamations about it. It has to be secured both insubstance and in practice. The society has a stake inensuring the independence of the Judiciary and noprice is too heavy to secure it. Anyway, Sub-ordi-nate Courts occupy a special place in the Constitu-tion under Articles 114 to LLOA, The recruitmentand conditions of service of the members of the            Judicial Service are regulated by the Rules made bythe President under Article 115 of the Constitution,Si as per Note: 1 of the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence, the order therein is to be observed forState and ceremonial occasions as well as for allpurposes of the Government, it has lowered themdown in the estimation of the people. It is necessaryfor them in the public interest and in the interest ofjustice to be seen to be of a rank sufficient to com-mand obedience to their judgments and orders. Asthe Warrant of Precedence has an effect on the pub-lic psyche, it should necessarily reflect the rank, sta-tus and precedence of the District Judges properly.So the relative ranking of the functionaries in theTable of the Warrant of Precedence is of a signifi-cant nature, and not merely of a ceremonial nature.This, in fact, affects the ability of the District Judgesand other Judicial Officers to perform their func-tions effectively and independently without virtual-ly being or being seen to be inferior to certain cate-gories of civil servants. The placement of theDistrict Judges at serial No. 24 in the Table of theimpugned Warrant of Precedence is derogatory tothe dignity of their office and is violative of Article31 of the Constitution. The impugned Warrant ofPrecedence fails to appreciate that all constitutionalposts, such as the Judges of the Supreme Court ofBangladesh, Attorney-General, Comptroller andAuditor-General, Members of Parliament andMembers of the Judicial Service etc. are not parts ofthe Civil Service of the Republic and they cannot becompared with the servants of the Republic and themembers of the Civil Service and the Armed Forcesin particulary Hence, the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence is liable to be struck down as being arbi-trary, malafide and wltra vires the Constitution.6. In the supplementary-affidavit filed onbehalf of the petitioner, it has been averred that dif-ferent countries like Canada, Australia, England andSri Lanka have made Warrants of Precedence con-sidering their respective Constitutions and laws.7. The respondent Nos, | and 3 has contestedthe Rule by filing three separate A flidavits-in-Oppo-sition, The averments made in the Affidavits-in-Opposition of the respondent No. | and the respon-dent No. 3 are almost similar, Their case as set outin the Affidavits-in-Opposition, in brief, runs as fol-lows:8. The Writ Petition is incompetent as a pub-lic interest litigation. The impugned Warrant ofPrecedence, 1986 is an executive flat and, as such, itis not judicially reviewable. According to the Cons-titution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, thePresident is the Head of the State and all the execu-tive actions of the Government are expressed to betaken in the name of the President. In accordancewith the Constitution, the appointments of the PrimeMinister, Chief Justice of Bangladesh, Judges of theSupreme Court, Ministers, Attorney-General, Chiefs,of Staff of the Defence Services, Comptroller andAuditor-General, Chief Election Commissioner andElection Commissioners, Chairman and Membersof the Public Service Commission, Members of theServices of the Republic, Members of the JudicialService etc. are made by the President. He is theguardian of all the three organs of the State, namely,the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.The impugned Warrant of Precedence was promul-gated in pursuance of his direction. It is true that theDistrict Judges and Deputy Commissioners havebeen placed along with others at serial No. 24 in theTable of the Warrant of Precedence. But the post ofthe Deputy Commissioner is not a mid-level post ofthe Republic. According to the charter of duties, thepost of the Deputy Commissioner is the highest postof the district administration. In that view of thematter, the District Judges have been equated andplaced together with the Deputy Commissioners atserial No. 24 in the Table.9. Prior to framing of the Warrant of Prece-dence in 1986, the Secretaries’ Committee examinedits draft prepared by the Cabinet Division and thisCommittee made recommendations — thereon.Eventually, the recommendations were placed in ameeting before the Council Committee headed byRear Admiral Sultan Ahmad, DCMLA, Chief’ ofNaval Staff and Minister for Ports, Shipping andInland Water Transports to review the proposal of            the Warrant of Preceden In that meeting, theposition and status of different functionaries wereexamined in order to maintain appropriate equiva-Jence in the allied bodies. Thereafter, the CouncilCommittee made recommendations for makingrequired changes in the then Warrant of Precedencewhich were ultimately approved by the President.Ry the way, in the Warrant of Precedence ofpakistan, it is found that the position of the DistrictJudges and that of the Deputy Commissioners are atserial No. 27, On the other hand, in India and Nepal,the positions of the District Judge and the DeputyCommissioner have not even been included in theirrespective Warrants of Precedence, However, as theguardian of all the three organs of the State, thePresident properly determined the placements ofvarious functionaries in the Table of the Warrant ofPrecedence in 1986 and since then it was updated in1987, 1988, 1991 and 2000.10. The President, Prime Minister, Speaker,Ministers, Judges of the Supreme Court, Attorney-General, Comptroller and Auditor-General, ElectionCommissioners and the like are no doubt constitu-tional office-holders; but it can not be said by anystretch of imagination that the members of theJudicial Service are constitutional functionaries.They are persons in the service of the Republic andtheir jurisdictions are circumscribed by territoriallimits and that being so, they cannot be equated withand placed together with the constitutional incum-bents in the Table of the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence.11. Chapter 1 of Part IX of the Constitutiondeals with the services of Bangladesh generally.Persons belonging to the Judicial Service are notmembers of the civil executive services, though theyare in the service of the Republic. But it does notmean or imply that they enjoy higher status than thatof the persons belonging to the defence services,local Government and civil executive services, Theservice conditions stipulated under Articles 133 and135 of the Constitution do equally apply to the judi-cial officers as well as the civil executive officers.Therefore, civil executive officers are also withinthe scheme of the same Constitution and they maycertainly be different in respect of powers and func-tions from judicial officers. But for that reason, civilexecutive officers cannot be treated as inferior tojudicial officers and vice versa. Different serviceslike defence services, local Government, judicialservice and all other services of the Republic havebeen duly considered, contemplated, recognised anddealt with at different places and under differentArticles of the Constitution, as were deemed appro-priate by the framers of the Constitution keeping inmind the broad principles of separation of powers inthe scheme of the Constitution. Nowhere in theConstitution, it has been contemplated that the judi-cial service shall enjoy a higher rank and status orposition than other services of the Republic. Theterms and conditions of services of the constitution-al functionaries are regulated and determined byspecial laws, and not by rules, as mandated byArticle 147 of the Constitution. The attempt of thepetitioner to raise the judicial officers to the level ofthe constitutional functionaries by filing the instantWrit Petition is an unscrupulous attempt to under-mine the dignity, status and position of the constitu-tional functionaries. Since the judicial officers arepersons in the service of the Republic, the DistrictJudges have been rightly and properly placed at seri-al No. 24 in the Table of the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence. District Judges hold district-level postslike Deputy Commissioners and at the district-level,they have been shown at the highest serial numberabove Civil Surgeons and Superintendents of Police.Deputy Secretaries to the Government are nationallevel posts and for that reason, they have beenshown at serial number 25 not as being within theirrespective charges. It is an unfounded claim thatDistrict Judges being the highest post-holders in theBangladesh Judicial Service are on the same footingwith political and legislators. Such a claim has nolegal or constitutional basis.12. The political executives formulate the poli-cies of the Government and supervise the enforce-ment of the laws and policies. But the actual workof enforcing the laws and policies of the            Government is done by the administrative execu-tives. The Constitution assigns to the Legislature,the Executive and the Judiciary clearly demarcatedroles; each controlled by constitutional provisions.The responsibility of seeing that no functionary ofthe State oversteps the limit of his power is, ofy, On the Judiciary; but this does not renderthe judiciary a superior organ of the State. Itremains as a co-ordinate and co-equal organ with theother two organs of the State, namely, the Executiveand the Legislature, though it has to perform the del-icate task of ensuring compliance with the provi-sions of the Constitution by all the organs of theState. The separation of the lower judiciary fromthe executive organ of the State and its independ-ence from the executive influence do not mean thatthe judicial officers are above the administrativeexecutives. They are independent in the dischargeof their judicial functions subject to the provisionsof the Constitution, Since the judicial officers arepublic servants like the administrative executives;the placement of District Judges together withDeputy Commissioners at serial No, 24 in the Tableof the Warrant of Precedence is lawful. As the pol-icy decision of the Government, the Warrant ofPrecedence is not subject to judicial review.13. The respondent No. | has also filed a sup-plementary affidavit-in-opposition virtually reiterat-ing the averments made in the original A ffidavit-in-Opposition. So the statements made in the supple-mentary affidavit-in-opposition are not repeated.14. The case of the respondent No. 2 as set outin the Affidavit-in-Opposition, in brief, runs as fol-lows:The petitioner has no /ocus standi to file theWrit Petition as a public interest litigation. Theimpugned Warrant of Precedence, 1986 was madeby the Cabinet Division according to the directive ofthe President. The placement of District Judges inthe Table of the Warrant of Precedence is the sub-ject-matter of the Administrative Tribunal and bythat reason, the instant Writ Petition under Article102 of the Constitution is misconceived, It is truethat the post of the District Judge is these highestpost of the subordinate judiciary. Since the DistrictJudge is the highest post at the field-level, so is thecase with the Deputy Commissioner at the field.level in the executive side. So both District Judgesand Deputy Commissioners have been placedtogether at the same serial number 24 in the Table ofthe Warrant of Precedence. The subjective satisfac-tion of the authority cannot be questioned in respectof placement of the persons in the said Table.15. At the outset, Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud.the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the peti-tioner, submits that the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence, 1986 does not provide for any objectivestandard or yardstick on which it is based and. assuch, it is ex facie clear that the same was arbitrari-ly framed and in this view of the matter, it is with-out lawful authority and of no legal effect.16. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud further submitsthat pursuant to Article 55(6) of the Constitution, theRules of Business, 1996 were framed and Schedule1 of the Rules of Business deals with allocation ofbusiness among the different Ministries andDivisions and as per the said Schedule | of the Rulesof Business, the Cabinet Division has been allocat-ed the subject "Warrant of Precedence’; but theCabinet Secretary upon opaque considerations hasplaced himself along with the Chiefs of Staff of theArmy Navy and Air Force and the PrincipalSecretary to the Government at serial No. 12 where-as some constitutional functionaries like the Attor-ney-General for Bangladesh, the Comptroller andAuditor-General and the Ombudsman have beenplaced at serial No. 15 in the Table of the Warrant ofPrecedence and this placement of the CabinetSecretary and others above those constitutionalfunctionaries is an affront to the scheme of theConstitution and this is why, the said Warrant ofPrecedence is liable to be struck down as beingunconstitutional.17. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud next submitsthat the Sub-ordinate Judiciary occupies a specialplace in Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution:but that was inexplicably disregarded at the timeframing of the impugned Warrant of Precedence and            pistrict Judges exercising the judicial power of theRepublic should have been placed above thesceretaries to the Government of Bangladesh inclu-ding the Cabinet Secretary in theWarrant of Precedence, regard being had to the ‘ratiodecidendi’ in all India Judges' Association case (AIR1903 SC 2493) and Masdar Hossain's case (52 DLR(AD) $2),Table of the18. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud also submits thatour Appellate Division in Masdar Hossain's case hasadopted the ‘ratio’ enunciated in the case of All Indiajudges’ Association that the Judges of the Sub-ordi-nate Judiciary are also the wielders of the judicialpower of the Republic and they represent the author-ity of the republic just like the political executives andthe legislators and as such the District Judges shouldhave been placed at an appropriate place in the Tableof the Warrant of Prece-dence.19. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud also Submitsthat since the Constitution is the supreme law of theRepublic, the constitutional office-holders musthave precedence in the Table of the Warrant ofPrecedence first and thereafter the constitutionallyreferred, defined or recognized posts like the postsof the District Judge and the Chiefs of Staff of theDefence Services of Bangladesh are to be placed inthe said Table followed by the placement of otherpublic functionaries and this having not been doneby the respondent No.1, the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence is malafide and of no legal effect.20. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud also submitsthat the impugned Warrant of Precedence, havingnot been based on reason, logic, rationality and theconstitutional scheme is liable to be knocked down.21. Mr Rokanuddin Mahmud further submitsthat excepting the Cabinet Secretary and the Princi-pal Secretary to the Government, the other Secre-taries have curiously been placed at serial No.16 inthe Table of the impugned Warrant of Precedenceand since the Principal Secretary, the CabinetSecretary and the other Secretaries stand on thesame footing, it does not stand to reason as to whythe Cabinet Secretary and the Principal Secretaryhave been placed for above the other Secretaries inthe Table and this scenario is indicative of the capri-ciousness, Whimsicality and unreasonableness onthe part of the respondent No.1 in framing theimpugned Warrant of Precedence, though it is pur-ported to have been framed at the directive of thePresident.22. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud nest submitsthat it is a public interest litigation, pure and simpleand the petitioner being a member of the judicialservice and the Secretary-General of the JudicialService Association has the standing or locus standito file the Writ Petition and he represents a vast mul-titude of persons who can not come up with WritPetitions individually on the self-same avermentsbefore this Court and over and above, the petitioneris not an interloper or a busybody and he has tried tovindicate the dignity, prestige and honour of theoffice of the District Judge in the perception of thepeople by challenging the placement of the DistrictJudge at serial No.24 in the Table of the impugnedWarrant of Precedence. In support of the standing ofthe petitioner, Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud has drawnour attention to Masdar Hossain's case, 52 DLR(AD) 82 and BELA's case, 49 DLR (AD) 1.23. Dr M Zahir, another learned Counselappearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits thatconstitutionally, functionally and structurally, themembers of the judicial service are a class apart andin that view of the matter, they can not be comparedor equated with the members of the civil executiveservices and it has been categorically and unequivo-cally held in the case of All India Judges' Associa-tion and the case of Masdar Hossain that even thejudges of the sub-ordinate judiciary stand on a parwith the political executives and the legislators andas such, if any comparison is to be made, then thatshould be made between the judges and the politicalexecutives and the legislators; but curiously enough,the District Judges have been placed at serial No.24in the Table of the Warrant of Precedence which isderogatory to their dignity and status and this willhave negative impact on the public psyche resultingin loss of respect of the people for them.            24. Mr Asaduzzaman, another leamed Counselappearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits thatplacing of the District Judges at serial No.24 in theTable of the Warrant of Precedence is a publicwrong as well as a public injury and the petitionerbeing a conscious citizen and the Secretary-Generalof the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association hascome up with the present Writ Petition to redress thesaid public wrong and public injury. As to the stand-ing of the petitioner under Article 102 of theConstitution, Mr Asaduzzaman adverts to the ETV'scase reported in 54 DLR (AD) 130.25. On the contrary, Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury,the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the res-pondent No.1, submits that the President in his wis-dom directed the framing of the impugned Warrantof Precedence and the wisdom of the President cannot be questioned by filing this Writ Petition and assuch, the Writ Petition should be held to be no main-tainable under Article 102 of the Constitution.26. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury further submitsthat the impugned Warrant of Precedence is a policydecision of the Government and from this stand-point, it is not judicially reviewable unless it iscapricious, whimsical and arbitrary. In support ofthis submission, he refers to two decisions of theIndian Supreme Court reported in AIR 1973 SC 588(State of Maharashtra vs Lok Shikshan Sanstha andothers) and AIR 1994 SC 2311 (State of UP vs UPUniversity Colleges Pensioners’ Association).27. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury next submitsthat the petitioner has no /ocus standi to prefer theWrit Petition under Article 102 of the Constitutionin view of the fact that he has not come up toespouse a public cause and as such the Writ Petitionshould be held to be incompetent.28. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury also submitsthat the Writ Petition is an amalgam of both a Writof Certiorari and a Writ of Mandamus and as thePetitioners has no legal right to pray for issuance ofa Writ of Mandamus, the respondent No.1 can not bedirected to revise the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence or to frame a new one.29. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury further submitsthat the petitioner being a public servant shouldhave invoked the jurisdiction of the AdministrativeTribunal for redress of his grievance in respect ofplacement of the District Judges at serial No.24 inthe Table of the impugned Warrant of Precedence;but this having not been done, he has not standingunder Article 102 of the Constitution.30. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury further submitsthat as per the National Pay Scale of 2005 and there-after, as per National Pay Scale of 2009, the scale ofDistrict Judge has been fixed as Grade 3; but none theless, they pay scale in not the determining factor fordetermination of precedence of a functionary in theTable of the Warrant of Precedence and though theDistrict Judges are getting the pay scale of JointSecretaries to the Government of Bangladesh, butregard being had to the functions of the JointSecretaries pervading throughout the country, theyhave been placed above the District Judges in the saidTable and since a District Judge is a District-level offi-cial, he has been rightly placed with the deputyCommissioner at serial No.24 in the Table and thisbeing the state of affairs, no exception can be takenthereto.31. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury also submits |that this Court should exercise self-restraint andrefrain from judicially reviewing the impugnedWarrant of Precedence inasmuch as it is the functionof the Executive to frame it and the Executive hasthe expertise in determining the precedence of thepersons named in the Table.32. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury next submitsthat all the three organs of the State, that is to say,the executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary haveto function within the parameters set by theConstitution itself and the Judiciary should notmake any incursion upon the provinces assigned tothe Executive and the Legislature and in this per-spective, ‘this Court should wash its hands of thematter.            33. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury also submitsthat at the most, the impugned Warrant of Prece-dence may be reviewed administratively, but notjudicially.34. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury further submitsthat following the decision in the case of All IndiaJudges’ Association, the current Warrant of Prece-dence in India has not been amended as yet and itappears that the decision rendered in that case by theIndian Supreme Court is yet to be implementedfully.35. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury next submitsthat the impugned Warrant of Precedence cannot beassailed in that it is predicated upon internationalpractices, customs and usages,36. Mr Md Nazrul Islam Talukder, the learnedDeputy Attorney-General appearing for the respon-dent No.2 and Mr SM Rezaul Karim, the learnedAdvocate appearing for the respondent No.3, adoptthe submissions advanced by Mr Abdur RobChaudhury.37. We have heard the submissions of MrRokanuddin Mahmud, Dr M Zahir and Mr Asad-uz-zaman and the counter-submissions of Mr AbdurRab Chaudhury and perused the Writ Petition,Supplementary Affidavit, A ffidavits-in-Opposition,and Supplementary A ffidavit-in-Opposition and therelevant Annexures annexed thereto.38. In the first place, we are to determine as towhether the petitioner has the Jocus standi to file theWrit Petition. In other words, we are to determine asto whether he can cross the threshold stage vis-a-visthe impugned Warrant of Precedence.39. In judicial review, the Court is concernedwith the question whether the impugned action inlawful or unlawful and the basic power of the Courtin relation to an illegal decision are to quash it. If thematter has to be decided again, it must be done theoriginal deciding authority. The Court exercises thepower of judicial review on the basis that powerscan be validly exercised only within their limits anda public functionary is not to be allowed to trans-gress the limits of his authority conferred by theConstitution or the laws. The Court also exercisesthe power of judicial review if an impugned actionor decision is malafide and in case of violation offundamental rights.40. Judicial review is a common law remedy inEngland. In "Administrative Law", by HWR Wade,6th edition, it has been mentioned at page 280 "TheCourts of law have inherent jurisdiction, as a matterof common law, to prevent administrative authori-ties from exceeding their powers or neglecting theirduties." The power of judicial review conferred byArticle 102 in our jurisdiction is a basic feature ofthe Constitution and in view of the decision inAnwar Hossain Chowdhury's case 1989 BLD (Spl) 1= 41 DLR (AD) 165, it cannot be taken away or cur-tailed even by amendment of the Constitution,41. Under Article 102 of our Constitutionexcept for an application for habeas corpus or quowarranto, a Writ Petition can be filed only by a 'per-son aggrieved’, Thus in order to have locus standi toinvoke the jurisdiction, an applicant has to show thathe is an aggrieved party in an application for certio-rari, mandamus or prohibition.42. The leading English case on /ocus standi isex parte Sidebotham, (1880) 14 Ch D 458 whetherthe Court held that a person aggrieved is a man"who has suffered a legal grievance, a man againstwhom a decision has been pronounced which has.wrongly deprived him of something, or wrongfullyrefused him something, or wrongfully affected histitle to something.” The same view was taken in sub-sequent cases. The Pakistani and Indian Courts weregreatly influenced by these English decisions, In thecase of Tariq Transport Company, Lahore vsSargodha-Bhera Bus Service, Sargodha reported in11 DLR (SC) 140, the Supreme Court of Pakistanobserved. ".....a person seeking judicial review mustshow that he has a direct personal interest in the actwhich he challenges before his prayer for review isentertained." That Writ Petition was filed underArticle 170 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1956.The same view was taken in respect of locus straniunder Article 98 of the Constitution of Pakistan,            1962. Therefore, an association, though registered,did not have /ocus standi to vindicate the personal orindividual grievance of its members, But in the caseof Mian Fazal Din vs Lahore Improvement Trustreported in 27 DLR (SC) 225, the Pakistan SupremeCourt took somewhat liberal view stating—he right considered sufficient formaintaining a proceeding of this nature is notssarily a right in the strict juristic sense; butenough if the applicant disclose that he hada personal interest in the performance of thelegal duty, which if not performed or performedin a manner not permitted by law, would resultin the loss of some personal benefit or advan-tage or the curtailment of a privilege or libertyor franchise."43. The Indian Supreme Court also followedthe English decisions in the matter of standing bothfor the enforcement of fundamental rights and forother constitutional remedies.44. The traditional view of locus standi has an“adverse effect on the rule of law. Schwartz andWade commented in "Legal Control of Govern-ment" (1972) edition) at 291:"Restrictive rules about standing are ingeneral inimical to a healthy system of admin-istrative law. If a plaintiff with a good case isturned away, merely because he is not suffi-ciently affected personally, that means thatsome government agency is left free to violatethe law, and that is contrary to public interest."45. Before we proceed further in quest of themeaning of the term ‘person aggrieved’ in Article102 of our Constitution, it will be worthwhile tonote the development in other jurisdictions in thisregard.46. With the increase of governmental func-tions, the English Courts found the necessity of lib-eralizing the standing rule to preserve the integrityof the rule of law. When a public-spirited citizenchallenged the policy of the police department not toprosecute the gaming clubs violating the gaminglaw, the Court heard him, though no clear-cut anddefinitive answer to the standing question wasgiven. (RV Metropolitan Police Commissioner ex pBlackburn [1968] 1 All ER 763) The Court alsoheard Mr Blackburn challenging the action of theGovernment in joining the European CommonMarket. (Blackburn vs Attorney-General [1971] >All ER 1380) Again, Mr Blackburn was accordedstanding in enforcing the public duty owed by thepolice and Greater London Council in respect otexhibition of pornographic films. (RV MetropolitanPolice Commissioner ex P Blackburn [1973] All ER324). In all the cases mentioned above, the dutyowed by the public authorities was to the generalpublic and not an individual or to a determinateclass of persons and the applicants were found tohave /ocus standi as they had ‘sufficient interest’the performance of the public duty.in47. In India, the concept of public interest liti-gation (public-spirited citizens bringing matters ofgreat public importance) was initiated by Mr VRKrishna lyer, J in the case of Mumbai KamgarSabha, Bombay vs Ms Abdul Bhai reported in AIR1976 SC 1466. However, a definite jurisprudentialbasis was laid down .in the case of SP Gupta vyPresident of India reported in AJR 1982 SC 149where several advocates of different Bars chal-lenged the action of the Government in transferringsome Judges of the High Courts. In that case, inaccording standing to the petitioners, Justice Bhag-wati observed in paragraph 17:"17, Where a legal wrong or a legal injuryis caused to a person or to a determinate class ofpersons by reason of violation of any constitu-tional or legal right or any burden is imposed incontravention of any constitutional or legal pro-vision or without authority of law or any suchlegal wrong or legal injury or illegal burden isthreatened and such person or determinate classof persons is, by reason of poverty, helplessnessor disability or socially or economically disad-vantaged position, unable to approach the Courtfor relief, any member of the public can main-tain an application....... seeking judicial redressfor the legal wrong or injury caused to such per-son or determinate class of persons."            48. The wave of this development also reachedPakistan, In the case of Benazir Bhutto vs Federa-tion of Pakistan, PLD 1988 SC 416, the PakistanSupreme Court held that as the provision of Article184(3) (which corresponds to Indian Article 32) isopen-ended, the proceedings could be maintainedby an individual whose fundamental rights areinfracted or by a person bona fide alleging infractionof the fundamental rights of a class or a group ofpersons, as there is no rigid incorporation of thenotion of ‘aggrieved party’ in Article 184 (3).In the case of Bangladesh SangbadpatraParishad vs Bangladesh reported in 43 DLR (AD)J26, the Association of newspaper-owners chal-lenged an award given by the Wage Board and theHigh Court Division dismissed the petition holdingthat the Association had no locus standi, TheAppellate Division upheld the finding of the HighCourt Division. Dealing with the Indian decisionsregarding public interest litigation, the AppellateDivision observed in paragraphs 9 and 10:"9. In our Constitution, the petitioner seekingenforcement of a fundamental right or constitu-tional remedies must be a ‘person aggric-ved."Our Constitution is not at pari materia with theIndian Constitution on this point. The IndianConstitution, either in Article 32 or in Article226, has not mentioned who can apply forenforcement of fundamental rights and constitu-tional remedies. The Indian Courts only hon-oured a tradition in requiring that the petitionermust be an ‘aggrieved person.’ The emergencein India of pro bono publico litigation, that is lit-igation at the instance of a public-spirited citizenespousing causes of others, has been facilitatedby the absence of any Constitutional provisionas to who can apply for a writ. In England, var-ious tests were applied. Some-times it was saidthat a person must be ‘aggrie-ved' or he musthave ‘a specific legal right’ or he must have 'suf-ficient interest’, Now after the introduction ofthe new Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 53Rule 3, any person can apply for ‘judicialreview’ in England under the Supreme CourtAct, 1981 if he has ‘sufficient interest.’10. Therefore, the decisions of the Indianjurisdiction on public interest Jithardly apt in our situation, We must confineourselves to asking whether the petitioner is an‘aggrieved person’, a phrase which has receiveda meaning and a dimension over the years."49. In that case, public interest litigation wasnot involved. There was no difficulty on the part ofthe newspaper-owners to challenge the award them-selves. So the Appellate Division denied standing tothe Association of newspaper-owners. The observa-tion quoted above must be understood in the light ofthe facts of that case.50. In the case of Bangladesh Retired Govern-ment Employees' Welfare Association vs Bangladeshreported in 46 DLR 426, the High Court Divisionaccepted the standing of the said Association hold-ing—"Since the Association has an interest inventilating the common grievance of all itsmembers who are retired Government employ-ees, in our view, this Association is a 'personaggrieved'..."51. In the case of Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman vsBangladesh reported in 26 DLR (AD) 44 (common-ly known as Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman's case), it washeld, inter alia, in paragraph 17:It appears to us that the question of focusstandi does not involve the Court's jurisdictionto hear a person but of the competency of theperson to claim a hearing, so that the question isone of discretion which the Court exercisesupon due consideration of the facts and circum-stances of each case."52. The Appellate Division settled seven gen-eral principles in Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman's case asto the standing of a person aggrieved, namely, (1)the High Court Division does not suffer trom anylack of jurisdiction under Article 102 to hear a per>son; (2) the High Court Division will grant /ocus            srandi to a person who agitates a question affecting,a constitutional issue of grave importance, posing athreat to his fundamental rights which pervade andextend to the entire territory of Bangladesh; (3) if'afundamental right is involved, the impugned matterneed not affect a purely personal right of the appli-cant touching him alone it is enough if he shares thatright in common with others; (4) in interpreting thewords ‘any person aggrieved’, consideration of‘Fundamental Rights' in Part IIT of the Constitutionis a relevant one; (5) it is the competency of the per-son to claim a hearing which is at the heart of theinterpretation of the words "any person aggrieved";(6) it is a question of exercise of discretion by theHigh Court Division as to whether it will treat thatperson aggrieved or not; and (7) the High CourtDivision will exercise that jurisdiction upon the con-sideration of the facts and circumstances of eachcase.53. Article 102 of our Constitution speaksabout ‘person aggrieved’, What is the meaning ofthis expression? The Constitution has not definedthe expression, nor has it mentioned ‘personallyaggrieved person’. An expression occurring in theConstitution cannot be interpreted out of context oronly by reference to the decisions of foreign juris-dictions where the constitutional dispensations aredifferent from ours. In interpreting the expression‘person aggrieved’, it cannot be overlooked that theEnglish Courts which ‘introduced the restrictive ruleof standing vastly shifted from their traditional viewwhich was ultimately changed by legislation. Theexpression has to be given a meaning in the contextof the scheme and objectives of the Constitution andin the light of the purpose behind the grant of theright to the individuals and the power to the Court.Any interpretation, which undermines the scheme orobjectives of the Constitution, or defeats the purposefor which the jurisdiction is created, is to be dis-carded. It has to be noted that the framers of theConstitution envisioned a society in which the ruleof law, fundamental human rights and freedom,equality and justice (political, economic and social)would be secured for all citizens, They spoke abouttheir vision in the Preamble in no uncertain terms,To give full effect to the rule of law, substantive pro.vision has been made in Article 7, which states thatall powers in the Republic, shall be exercised onlyunder and by the authority of the Constitution, Thevision of the society has been re-stated in Article §and elaborated in other Articles of Part II. Article8(2) specifically states that the principles of Statepolicy set down in Part II will be fundamental to thegovernment of Bangladesh. To ensure the funda-mental human rights and freedom and equality andjustice, the Constitution has guaranteed a host ofrights in Part IIIf as fundamental rights. And toensure that the mandate of the Constitution. isobeyed, the Supreme Court has been given the widepower of judicial review. In this background, canthe expression ‘person aggrieved’ be given a mean-ing in consonance with the traditional view of locusstandi and thereby producing a result deprecated bySchwartz and Wade as inimical to a healthy systemof administrative law and contrary to the publicinterest? The Appellate Division has answered thequestion in the negative in the case of Dr MohiuddinFarooque vs Bangladesh reported in 49 DLR (AD) |(popularly known as BELA's case).54. The expression ‘person aggrieved’ means aperson who even without being personally affectedhas sufficient interest in the matter in dispute. Whena public functionary has a public duty owed to thepublic in general, every citizen has sufficient inter-est in the performance of that public duty.55. In BELA’s case, his Lordship Mr JusticeMostafa Kamal of the Appellate Division held inparagraph 40:"40, We now proceed to say how we inter-pret Article 102 as a whole. We do not givemuch importance to the dictionary meaning orPunctuation of the words ‘any personaggrieved.' Article 102 of our Constitution isnot an isolated island standing above or beyondthe sea level of the other provisions of theConstitution. It is a part of the over-all scheme,objectives and purposes of the Constitution.And its interpretation is inextricably linked withthe (i) emergence of Bangladesh and framing of            its Constitution, (ii) the Preamble and Article 7,(iii) Fundamental Principles of State Policy, (iv)Fundamental Rights and (v) the other provi-sions of the Constitution.”56. The Constitution, historically and in realWrit petitions, each repretion of concern, In so farnting his own por-t concerns publicwrong or public injury or invasion of funda-mental rights of an indeterminate number ofpeople, any member of the public, being a citi-zen, suffering the common injury or commonterms, is a manifestation of what is called "thePeople's Power". The people of Bangladesh are,therefore, central, as opposed to ornamental, to theframing of the Constitution. It was further held ininvasion in common with others or any citizenor an indigenous association, as distinguishedfrom a local component of a foreign orzaniza-A'S case in paragraph 47:The Supreme Court being a vehicle, amedium or mechanism devised by theConstitution for the exercise of the judicialpower of the people on behalf of the people, thepeople will always remain the focal point ofconcern of the Supreme Court while dispensingjustice or propounding any judicial theory orinterpreting any provision of the Constitution.Viewed in this context, interpreting the words“any person aggrieved" meaning only andexclusively individuals and excluding the con-sideration of people as a collective and consol-idated personality will be a stand taken againstthe Constitution, There is no question ofenlarging /ocus standi or legislation by Court.The enlargement is writ large on the face of theConstitution."57. Ultimately Mr Justice Mostafa Kamal heldin the same case in paragraph 48:"48.0...The traditional view remains true, validand effective till today in so far as individualrights and individual infraction thereof are con-cerned. But when a public injury or publicwrong or infraction of a fundamental rightaffecting an indeterminate number of people isinvolved, it is not necessary, in the scheme ofour Constitution, that the multitude of individu-als who have been collectively wronged orinjured or whose collective fundamental rightshave been invaded are to invoke the jurisdictionunder Article 102 in multitude of individualtion, espousing that particular cause is a personaggrieved and has the right to invoke the juris-diction under Article 102."58. Where there is a written Constitution andan independent judiciary and the wrongs suffered byany section of the people are capable of being raisedand ventilated publicly in a Court of law, there isbound to be greater respect for the rule of law. ThePreamble of our Constitution really contemplates asociety where there will be unflinching respect forthe rule of law and the welfare of the citizens.59. In the decision in the case of Ekushey Tele-vision Ltd vs Dr Chowdhury Mahmood Hasanreported in 54 DLR (AD) 130 (popularly known asETV case), it was held in paragraph 48:"48. What is meant by ‘sufficient interest isbasically a question of fact and law which shallhave to be decided by the Court. None of thefundamental rights like rule of law is subject tomechanical measurement. They are measuredour human institutions i.e. the Courts and byhuman beings i.c. the Judges, by applying law.Therefore, there will always be an element ofdiscretion to be used by the Court in givingstanding to the petitioner. From the above, itappears that the Courts of this jurisdiction haveshifted their position to a great extent from thetraditional rule of standing which continesaccess to the judicial process only to those towhom legal injuries are caused or legal wrongis done. The narrow contines within which thetule of standing was imprisoned for long yearshave been broken and a new dimension is beinggiven to the doctrine of Jocus standi."            60. The petitioner, as already observed, is amember of the Judicial Service and the Secretary-General of Bangladesh Judicial Service Association,In view of the averments made in the Writ Petition,he does not appear to be cither an officious by-stander or an interloper or a busybody; rather byway of invoking the Writ Jurisdiction of the HighCourt Division under Article 102 of the Constitu-tion, he has brought to our notice a public wrong ora public injury and that is no doubt justifiable.Furthermore, his membership of the Judicial Serviceand office held with the Bangladesh Judicial ServiceAssociation eminently equip him both with the suf-ficiency of interest and the insight and ability toarticulate and realize the concerns as find place inthis petition. In this connection, it may be pointedout that Masdar Hossain's case was filed by the thenSecretary-General of the Judicial Service Associa-tion along with some members of the JudicialService and that case was found to be maintainableboth by the High Court Division and the AppellateDivision. Precisely speaking, the petitioner, there-fore, has the competency to claim a hearing underArticle 102 of the Constitution. The principlesenunciated in Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman's case, theBELA's case and the ETV case as to the doctrine oflocus standi referred to above are, to our way ofthinking, applicable to the facts and circumstancesof the present case. So we do not find any plausiblereason for coming to a conclusion other than that theinstant Writ Petition is competent and maintainable.Having regard to the above discussions, we have nohesitation in holding that it is a pro bono publico lit-igation and the petitioner is a ‘person aggrieved’with- in the meaning of Article 102 of theConstitution. In the result, we find that the WritPetition is maintainable at the instance of the peti-loner,61. It is the submission of Mr Abdur RabChaudhury that the impugned Warrant of Prece-dence is a policy decision of the Government and itcannot be judicially reviewed unless it is found to bewhimsical, capricious and arbitrary, We haveTepeatedly asked Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury to pointout the objective standards or yardsticks, if any, onwhich the impugned Warrant of Precedence mayand has to be predicated. But he has simply failedto reply to our queries in this regard. He has insteadsubmitted that the impugned Warrant of Precedenceas prepared as per the directive of the President can-not be questioned. Such a response, for want of fur-ther substantiation, is found to be untenable. In theAffidavit-in-Opposition filed by the respondent No,2, it has been averred with greater forthcomingnethat the basis of the placement of various func-tionaries in the Table of the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence is indeed the subjective satisfaction ofthe concerned authority. So professedly there are nodiscernible subscription to any objective guidelinesor criteria or yardsticks as regards placement of var-ious constitutional and public functionaries in thesaid Table. We concur with the submission of MrAbdur Rab Chaudhury that a policy decision of theGovernment is not subject to judicial review underArticle 102 of the Constitution unless it is arbitrary,whimsical and capricious. However, the facts andcircumstances of the cases of the State of Maha-rashtra vs Lok Shikshan Sanstha (AIR 1973 SC 588)and State of UP vs UP University Colleges Pen-sioners' Association (AIR 1994 SC 2311) adverted tobe Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury are quite distinguish-able from those of the instant case. So the decisionsrendered in two Indian cases do not seem to be ofany avail to him. In the absence of evidence of anydiscernible guidelines, objective standards, criteriaor yardsticks upon which the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence is or ought to be predicated, we fell con-strained to hold that the said Warrant of Precedencecannot shrug off the disqualification of being arbi-trary, irrational, whimsical and capricious and is, |therefore, subject to judicial review under Article102 of the Constitution.62. The constitutional implication of Article114 is that the Sub-ordinate Judiciary, unlike theSupreme Court of Bangladesh, is not a creature ofthe Constitution but of law. In other words, theSupreme Court is a creature of the Constitution; bulthe Subordinate Courts are creatures of laws.            Against this backdrop, the judicial officers manningthe Subordinate Courts cannot be on a par with theJudges of the Supreme Court.63. It has been asserted in unmistakable terms.in the Writ Petition that the members of the JudicialService are on a par with the constitutional func-tionaries and they are not persons in the service ofthe Republic. In course of hearing of the Writpetition and on being asked by this Court to refer tothe constitutional scheme and structure, Mr Asad-yz-zaman has candidly conceded that the judicialofficers are not constitutional functionaries. So thequestion of placement of the District Judges in theTable of the Warrant of Precedence on a par with theconstitutional office-holders does not stand to con-stitutional scheme.64. In that regard, we note that in Article152(1) of the Constitution, ‘Judicial service’, 'theservice of the Republic’ and ‘District Judge’,amongst others, have been defined. "Judicial serv-ice” means a service comprising persons holdingjudicial posts not being posts superior to that of aDistrict Judge. "The service of the Republic" meansany service, post or office whether in a civil or mil-itary capacity, in respect of the Government ofBangladesh, and any other service declared by lawto be a service of the Republic, "District Judge"includes Additional District Judge.65. It has been clearly held in MasdarHossain's case that the judicial officers are in theService of the Republic and they are subject to theAdministrative Tribunals Act, 1981. So the questionas to whether the judicial officers are in the serviceof the Republic or cannot be re-opened in this WritPetition. That question has been clinched by theAppellate Division in Masdar Hossain's case. So itleaves no room for doubt that the judicial officers,or, for that matter, the members of the JudicialService are persons in the service of the Republic.In this context, it may be said that the term 'Serviceof the Republic’ is a genus while the term ‘JudicialService’ is a species.66. In the case of All India Judges’ Avsovia-tion, AIR 1993 SC 2493 (Review Petition No, 249 of1992), it was held by the Indian Supreme Court inparagraphThis Court has, in the judgment underreview, pointed out that the linkage between theservice conditions of the judiciary and that ofthe administrative executives was a historicalaccident. The erstwhile rulers constituted onlyone service, viz, the Indian Civil Service forrecruiting candidates for the Judicial as well asthe Administrative Services and it is from; among the successful candidates in the exami-nation held for such recruitment, that somewere sent to the administrative side while oth-ers to the judicial side. Initially, there was alsono clear demarcation between the judicial andexecutive services and the same officers used toperform judicial and executive functions. Sincethe then Government had failed to make the dis-tinction between the two services right from thestage of the recruitment, its logical conse-quences in terms of the service conditions couldnot be avoided. With the inauguration of theConstitution and the separation of the StatePower distributed among the three Branches.the continuation of the linkage has becomeanachronistic and is inconsistent with the con-stitutional provisions."67. In the self-same case of All India Judges’Association, it was also held in paragraph 4:We cannot, however, help observing thatthe failure to realize the distinction between thejudicial service and the other services is at thebottom of the hostility displayed by the reviewpetitioners to the directions given in the jument. The judicial service is not service in thesense of ‘employment’. The judges are not            employees, As members of the judiciary, theythe sovereign judicial power of theState.

However, those who exercise the State-power are the ministers, the legislators and thejudges, and not the members of their staff whoimplement or assist in implementing their deci-sions. The council of ministers or the politicalexecutive is different from the secretarial staffor the administrative executive, which carriesout the decisions of the political executive.Similarly, the legislators are different from thelegislative staff.

Our Appellate Division in the decision inMasdar Hossain's case in paragraph 44 has adoptedthe above findings and observations made by theIndian Supreme Court in the case of All IndiaJudges' Association. So the natural corollary is thatthe Appellate Division has declared a law to theeffect that the members of the Judicial Service areon a par with the political executives or the legista.tors and above the administrative executives. Thislaw declared by the Appellate Division in MasdarHossain's case is binding upon the High CourDivision in view of the mandate of Article 11] ofour Constitution.69. It will not be out of place to mention thatMasdar Hossain’s case is still pending in the Appe}-late Division and the various directives given in thatcase are being implemented by the Government inphases. Contempt Petition No. 7 of 2004 was filedin the Appellate Division against some public func-tionaries for their wilful disobedience of some of thedirectives and this Contempt Petition No. 7 of 2004along with Civil Appeal No. 79 of 1999 (MasdarHossain's case) are being heard together. Reitera-ting the earlier stance, the Appellate Division passedan order dated 9th August, 2009 therein. The rele-vant portion of that order runs as under:"It should be noted that the attitude of thesupposed parallelism of the Judicial Servicewith the Executive Services is not the intentionof the relevant provisions of the Constitution.The notion of such parallelism that existed inthe past has been abandoned by the framers ofthe Constitution and the constitutional realityhas to be materialized in the relevant areasincluding pay and allowances of the members |of the Judicial Service."70. Mr Asaduzzaman has drawn our attentionto another order of the Appellate Division dated 8thDecember, 2009 passed in Masdar Hossain's case.The relevant extract of the order is as follows:"However, the learned Attorney-Generalverbally submitted that he would do his best tohighlight the legal position in this regard to theconcerned authorities of the Government thatthe Pay Scale of the highest post of the JudicialService should be refixed having regard to therecommendation of the Judicial Service PayCommission and should not be below the GradeNo. 1 of the National Pay Scale."            71. Itis admitted fact that the pay scale of thepistrict Judges has been fixed at Grade-3 in theNational Pay Scale of 2005 (now National Pay Scaleof 2009). This pay scale is equivalent to that of aJoint-Seeretary to the Government of Bangladesh,Our view is that the pay scale of'a public functionaryjs not the sole determining factor of his status orrank or precedence in the Warrant of Precedence;put nevertheless his pay scale is pre-eminently adetermining factor in that regard. In any event, ittranspires from the order dated 8th December, 2009that presumably the upgradation of the pay scale ofthe District Judge at least to Grade 1 in the Nationalpay Scale of 2009 is being considered by theGovernment,72. The three organs of the State, namely, theExecutive, the Legislature and the Judiciary areheaded by the Prime Minister, the Speaker and theChief Justice respectively and the three organs are toperform their respective functions within the boundsset by the Constitution. The political executives, thatis to say, the Ministers including the Prime Ministerexercise the executive power while the Judges ofboth the Higher Judiciary and the Sub-ordinateJudiciary exercise the judicial power of theRepublic. It must not be lost sight of the fact that inthe case of Mujibur Rahman vs Bangladesh, 33 DLR(AD) 111, it was held in paragraph 71 that both "theSupreme Court and the Sub-ordinate Courts are therepository of judicial power of the State."Constitutionally, functionally and structurally, judi-cial service stands on a different level from the civiladministrative executive services of the Republic.While the function of the civil administrative exec-Utive services is to assist the political executives informulation of policies and in execution of the poli-cy decisions of the Government of the day, the func-tion of the judicial service is neither of them. It is anindependent arm of the Republic, which sits onjudgment over parliamentary, executive and quasi-judicial actions, decisions and orders, To equate andto put on the same plane the judicial service with thecivil administrative executive services is to treat twounequal as equals.73. At this juncture, it is pertinent to note thatthe Supreme Court is the guardian of theConstitution and since the power of judicial reviewhas been vested therein, it is the solemn duty of theSupreme Court to check constitutional derailments,if any, of the two other organs of the State, namely,the Executive and the Legislature and to bring themon the right constitutional track. This power is notvested in the two other organs of the State, albeit allthe three organs of the State are co-ordinate and co-equal.74. The independence of the judiciary, asaffirmed and declared by Articles 94(4) and I 16A. isone of the basic pillars of the Constitution and cannot be demolished, whittled down, curtailed ordiminished in any manner whatsoever, except underthe existing provisions of the Constitution as held inMasdar Hossain's case.75. It goes without saying that on administra-tive executive, for example, a Secretary to theGovernment is a member of the Staff of theSecretariat. He does not make any policy decisions.He just carries out the orders of the political execu-tives and helps in the implementation of the polidecisions. So logically it follows that an administra-tive executive is always at the beck and call of thepolitical executives. But per contra, a JudicialOfficer is independent in the discharge of his funce-tions subject to the provisions of the Constitution aspostulated by Article 116A. Again, the Chiefs ofStaff of the Defence Services are subject to the con-trol of the political executives. The Chief of ArmyStaff is, of course, a member of that Staff, though heis the Chief thereof. The ChiefS of Naval and AirForce Staff are also similarly situated. They are notfunctionally liberated trom adherence to the order ofthe political executives. They are subservient to thepolitical executives by the relevant laws. This beingthe position, the Chiefs of Staff of the DefenceServices are not on the same footing with the politi-cal executives, legislators and judges who representand exercise the State-authority.            76. Since District Judges are comparable withpolitical executives or legislators and are, by thatreason, above administrative and defence execu-tives, they can not be equated with or placed on apar with administrative and defence executives inthe Table of the impugned Warrant of Precedence.By placing the District Judges at serial No.24 alongwith the Deputy Commissioners, Licutenant Colo-nels and others in the said Table, the respondentNo.1 has demeaned and degraded them (DistrictJudges) for all practical purposes in the estimationof the people. It is an indisputable fact that apartfrom State and ceremonial occasions, the order inthe Warrant of Precedence is to be observed for allpurposes of the Government’ without further elabo-ration or qualification of scope, purpose and objec-tive of the phrase. This is perhaps the only instru-ment of the Government for determination of one'srelative status in the eyes of the public. As the orderin the Warrant of Precedence is to be observed forall purposes of the Government too, the placementof the District Judges above the administrative anddefence executives in the Table thereof is all themore necessary with an eye to upholding their rank,priority and status in public perception. What we aredriving at boils down to this: the respondent No.1has committed a conceptual blunder by equating theDistrict Judges with the administrative and defenceexecutives and placing them together at serial No.24in the Table. This conceptual blunder should be cor-rected at the earliest.77. There is no gainsaying the fact that theConstitution has accorded special status to the con-stitutional incumbents. So their priority comes firstin the Warrant of Precedence. The status of the con-stitutionally recognized and referred post-holders,though public functionaries, in ingrained in thescheme of the Constitution, So in terms of priority,their placement should follow that of the constitu-tional incumbents. Lastly, the priority of other pub-lic functionaries should be fixed depending on theirrelative status.78. To our knowledge, this is a unique case notonly in our jurisdiction, but also in the whole of theworld. It seems that there is no uniformity in theWarrants of Precedence of the neighbouring coun.tries of Bangladesh as evidenced by Annexure-'2series of the Affidavit-in-Opposition of the respon-dent No.1 The contention of Mr Abdur Rab Chau-dhury that the impugned Warrant of Precedence isbased upon international practices, customs andusages can not be accepted after the verdict inMasdar Hossain's case. Furthermore, it is alsomeant for all purposes of the Government. But theIndian Warrant of precedence has no application inthe day-to-day business of the Government. Has theWarrant of Precedence of Bangladesh been suedonly for state and ceremonial occasions, it wouldhave no legal sanding like the United States Orderof precedence. The Warrant of Precedence ofPakistan is conspicuously silent about its use andobservance. For all the above reasons, the impugnedWarrant of Precedence is fundamentally differentfrom those of India. Pakistan, USA, etc. In fact, ourWarrant of Precedence is a type by itself.79. The logic that the District judges and theDeputy Commissioners being district-level officialhave been equated with and bracketed together atserial No.24 in the Table of the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence is fallacious for the Deputy Secretariesto the Government being national-level post-holdershave been placed below the Deputy Commissionersat serial No.25 in the Table. So we think, theimpugned Warrant of Precedence has no soundbasis.80. The current Warrant of Precedence in Indiahas not been challenged by any quarter. So the pri-ority or status of the District Judges of India has notbeen reflected therein as per the ‘ratio’ decided in thecase of All India Judges’ Association. But that cannot be a ground for us to refrain from assailing theimpugned Warrant of Precedence in view of thesound jurisprudential base emanating from MayuHossain's case in our own jurisdiction.81. MrAbdur Rab Chaudhury strenuously con-tends that in this particular case, this Court shouldexercise self-restraint and leave the matter to the            discretion of the Executive. To buttress up this con-tention, he has relied upon the unreported decisiondated 6-12-2007 in the case of the DivisionalManager, Aravali Golf Club vs Chander Hass inAppeal (Civil) 2 of 2007. He has, in particular,drawn our attention to paragraph 17 of that unre-ported decision which runs as follows :"17. Before parting with this case, wewould like to make some observations about thelimits of the powers of the judiciary. We arecompelled to make these observations becausewe are repeatedly coming across cases whereJudge is unjustifiably trying to perform execu-tive or legislative functions. In our opinion, thisis clearly unconstitutional, In the name of judi-cial activism, Judges can not cross their limitsand try to take over functions which belong toanother organ of the State."82. The facts and circumstances of the case inthe aforementioned Civil Appeal No.5732 of 2007and those of the instant case are poles apart. It is truethat in the garb of judicial review under Article 102of the Constitution, this Court should not make anyencroachment upon the domains assigned to theExecutive and the Legislature. As we see it, whileexercising the power of judicial review, the SupremeCourt should be on its guard and it should not ven-ture into judicial adventurism. It is our opinion thatthe frontiers of judicial review are being expandedwith the passage of time through judicial activismby the higher judiciary; but at the same time, careought to be taken to see that judicial activism doesnot turn into judicial adventurism. However, we feeltempted to quote an apt comment name by LordWoolf in his book "The Pursuit of Justice" (page-132) edited by Christopher Campbell-Holt and pub-lished by Oxford University Press, London whichruns thus ;"LT have no doubt that there is and has been,particularly in recent times, tension between thejudiciary and the executive, and that the tensionhas from time to time increased as a result ofthe decisions of Judges on applications for judi-cial review. I, however, do not regard this as amater of concern. It is no more than an indiea-tion that judicial review has been working wellduring a period when the other restraints on theexecutive were not as great as ideally theyshould be."83. In our jurisdiction, although there ising tension between the executive and the judiciaryover judicial review of administrative actions, thesalutary effect of judicial review can not be skirtedaround at all.84. Reverting to the present case, we positive-ly assert that we have not sermonised any quarter orembarked upon any judicial adventurism in the garbof judicial activism while exercising the power ofjudicial under Article 102 of the Constitution.85. With regard to the submission of Mr AbdurRab Chaudhury that the petitioner should haveapproached the Administrative Tribunal for redressof his grievance pertaining to the impugned Warrantof Precedence, but instead he has approached awrong forum under Article 102 of the Constitutiontherefor, Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud argues that theplacement of the District Judges along with others atserial No.24 in the Table of the Warrant ofPrecedence is not a term and condition of their serv-ice and as such the petitioner is not required toapproach the Administrative Tribunal for redress ofhis grievance and the matter is justifiable before theHigh Court Division under Article 102 of theConstitution. In the facts and circumstances of thecase, we find sufficient justification in the argumentof Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud.86. Be thatas it may, from a bare reading of theTable of the impugned Warrant of Precedence, it isevident that some constitutional and public fune-tionaries have been placed together at different seri-al numbers haphazardly, arbitrarily, irrationally,inequitably and unreasonably. Let us cite someexamples. The Cabinet Secretary, the PrincipalSecretary to the Government and the Chiefs of Stal!of the Army, Navy and Air Force have been brack-eted together at serial No. 12; but stunningly enough,some constitutional office holders like the Attorney-            General, Comptroller and Auditor-General andOmbudsman have been placed at serial No.15.Indisputably the Cabinet Secretary, the PrincipalSceretary and the Chiefs of Staff of the DefenceServices are persons in the service of the Republic,but their placement above those constitutional func-tionaries in the Table is a staggering blow to thescheme of the Constitution,87. Given that under the constitutional scheme,the Prime Minister, the Speaker and the ChiefJustice respectively head the three organs of theState, that scheme appears to have been accorded arecognition in the previous Warrant of Precedenceof 1975 to the extent of the Speaker and the ChiefJustice being placed at the same serial 4. But itappears that quite inexplicably, that arrangement hasbeen disturbed in the impugned Warrant of Prece-dence where the position of the Chief Justice hasbeen downgraded by placing the Speaker at serialNo.3 without any justifiable reason. However, it willbe reasonable, logical and in accordance with con-stitutional norms to bracket the Prime Minister, theSpeaker and the Chief Justice together at the sameserial number in the Table of the Warrant ofPrecedence.88. The members of the Parliament are law-makers and constitutional incumbents. They havebeen placed at serial humber 13, But quite arbitrari-ly and whimsically, they have been downgraded bythe Cabinet Secretary, the Principal Secretary andthe Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy and Air Forcewho have been bracketed together at serial number12.89. It transpires that the Secretaries to theGovernment (excluding the Cabinet Secretary andthe Principal Secretary) have been placed at serialNo.16 and the Chairman of the Public Service Com-mission has also been placed at the same serial No.16. Needless to say, the Chairman of the Public Ser-vice Commission is a constitutional office-holderand the Secretaries to the Government are persons inthe service of the Republic. So it does not stand toreason and logic as to why the Chairman of thePublic Service Commission has been equated withthe Secretaries and placed at the self-same serial No16 in the Table of the impugned Warrant ofPrecedence.90. Again the Members of the Public ServiceCommission and the Additional Secretaries to theGovernment have been bracketed together at serialNo. 19. The Members of the Public Service Com-mission are constitutional functionaries; but theyhave been equated with the Additional Secretariesand placed together at the same serial No. 19. Thisis plainly arbitrary bordering on absurdity.91. According to Lord Greene, an action of anauthority is unreasonable when it is so unreasonablethat no man acting reasonably could have taken it.this has come to be known as Wednesbury unrea-sonableness (Associated Provincial Picture vyWednesbury Corporation [1948] 1KB 223). In viewof what have been stated above, we are led to holdthat the impugned Warrant of Precedence is unrea-sonable in Wednesbury sense.92. Considering the above scenario, even MrAbdur Rab Chaudhury feels that the impugnedWarrant of Precedence may be reviewed administra-tively.93. As per the impugned Warrant of Prece-dence, the Table will be observed with respect to theprecedence of persons named therein. So the mean-ing of the word 'precedence' is very crucial relatingto the placement of the District Judges in the saidTable. Now let us look up the meaning of the word‘precedence! in some standard dictionaries of theworld. In the Chambers Dictionary, New Editionpublished by Allied Chambers (India) Limited, NewDelhi, 'precedence' means the act of going before intime; the right of going before; priority; the fact ofbeing before in rank; the place of honour; the fore-most place in ceremony. The word 'precedence' asgiven in Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary byAS Hornby (6th edition) means the condition ofbeing more important than somebody else and there-fore coming or being dealt with first (SYN) priority.In Black's Law Dictionary (8th edition), 'prece-            dence’ means the order or priority in place or timeobserved by or for persons of different statues (suchas political dignitaries) on the basis of rank duringecremonial events and another meaning of the wordis generally the act or state of going before some-thing else according to some system of priorities.94. From a combined reading of all the shadesof meaning of the word 'precedence' provided in theabove mentioned three dictionaries, it appears to usthat ‘precedence’ means priority and that priority isnecessarily and essentially predicated upon one'sstatus. The meaning of 'status' as given in the saidBlack's Law Dictionary is a person's legal condition,whether personal or proprietary; the sum total of aperson's legal rights, duties, liabilities and otherlegal relations, or any particular group of them sep-arately considered. So while formulating or makingthe Table of the Warrant of Precedence, the status ofa functionary, either constitutional or public, cannotbe sneezed at. But in the impugned Warrant ofprecedence, we have shockingly noticed that somefunctionaries have been placed far below others inderogation to their dignity, status and priority. It isindeed ill-conceived and ill-founded.95. Judges of the High Court Division havebeen placed at serior No. 9, though District Judgeshave been placed at serial No. 24 in the Table of theimpugned Warrant of Precedence. But when aDistrict Judge is appointed a Judge of the HighCourt Division under Article 95(1) of the Constitu-tion, he makes a quantum leap from serial No.24 toserial No.9, The non-placement of the DistrictJudges at a serial number in close proximity to thatof the Judges of the High Court Division in absolutedisregard of the constitutionally recognized poten-tial of upward mobility is really astounding.96. The District Judges will have precedencewith fetters like "within their respective charges" asmentioned at serial No.24 in the Table; but at theself-same serial No.24, officers of the rank ofLieutenant Colonel in the Army and equivalent inthe Navy and Air Force and Commandant, MarineAcademy have been placed without any such fetters,albeit their posts are localized. Besides, Professorsof Medical and Engineering Colleges have beenplaced at serial No.23 without any fetters. despitethe localized nature of their functions and responsi-bilities. We do not find reason or logic to fetter theprecedence of the District Judges within theirrespective charges in a unitary state as oursAnyway, in the Warrant of Precedence of even a fed-eral state like Pakistan, District Judges have beenplaced at serial No.27 without any fetters like-'with-in their respective charges’ and they enjoy prece-dence throughout the length and breadth of Pakistan.97. It is in the impugned Warrant of Prece-dence that it was made as per the directive of thePresident in 1986. At that time, the country wasunder the presidential form of Government and assuch the President was the Chief Executive of thecountry. But now in parliamentary dispensation, thePrime Minister is the Chief Executive. In this con-nection, Article 48(3) of the Constitution may beadverted to. Article 48(3) provides that in the exer-cise of all his functions, save only that of appointingthe Prime Minister pursuant to clause (3) of Article56 and the Chief Justice pursuant to clause (1) ofArticle 95, the President shall act in accordance withthe advice of the Prime Minister. So if any revisionof the impugned Warrant of Precedence is requiredor if a question arises as to framing of a new Warrantof Precedence altogether, then the Prime Minsterwill have the final say on the matter subject to anydirections, observations and findings given by theCourt in this case.98. Article 31 of the Constitution contemplatesthat to enjoy the protection of the law, and to betreated in accordance with law, and only in accor-dance with law, is the inalienable right of every cit-izen, whether he may be, and of every other personfor the time being within Bangladesh, and in partic-ular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body.reputation or property of any person shall be takenexcept in accordance with law. It is the declared lawof the Appellate Division in Masdar Hossain’s casethat Judges, at whatever level they may be, are on a            par with political executives and legislators andabove administrative executives. Ina word, the statusof the Judges has been finally and conclusivelydecided in Masdar Hossain's case. In such a postureof things, District Judges have the inalienable rightto be treated in accordance with the above lawdeclared by the Appellate Division, So they havlegal right to pray for issuance of a Writ of man-damus and the respondent No.1 has a legal duty tocomply therewith by placing the District Judgesappropriately in the Table of the Warrant ofPrecedence as per the dictates of the law clearlyenunciated in Masdar Hossain's case by heAppellate Division.99. In view of the foregoing discussions and inthe facts and circumstances of the case, we find thatalthough the impugned Warrant of Precedence is apolicy decision of the Government, but the same isbased on utter irrationality, unreasonableness, arbi-trariness, absurdity, whimsicality and preposterous-ness. Such being the position, it is struck down asbeing ultra vires the Constitution.100. However, we deem it prudent to formulatea set of directives for making a new Warrant ofPrecedence in the light of our observations and find-ings made above.101. The directives are as follows :(1) As the Constitution is the supreme lawof the land, all constitutional office-holders are to be placed first in orderof priority in the Table of the newWarrant of Precedence;2) Thereafier the constitutionally recog-nized and referred post-holders, name-ly, District Judges and Chiefs of Staffof the Defence Services of Bangladeshetc. are to be paced in the said Table;albeit they are persons in the service ofthe Republic;(3) Members of the Judicial Service hold-ing equivalent judicial posts of District at the same serial number of the Table:(4)Since as per Article 152(1) of theConstitution, District Judge includesAdditional District Judge, AdditionalDistrict Judges are to be placed at theserial number immediately after that ofDistrict Judges;(5)As the Chief Judicial Magistrates andthe Chief Metropolitan Magistrates areJudicial Officers of the rank and statusof Additional District. Judges. theChief Judicial Magistrates and theChief Metropolitan Magistrates are tobe paced at the same serial numberalong with additional District Judgesin the Table;(6)As we have found that Judges are on apar with political executives and legis-lators and above administrative anddefence executives, District Judges,Members of the Judicial Service hold-ing equivalent judicial posts of DistrictJudges, Additional District Judges,Chief Judicial Magistrates and ChierMetropolitan Magistrates are to bepaced above the Chiefs of Staff of theDefence Services of Bangladesh in theTable;(7)Public functionaries including Secre-taries to the Government of Bangla-desh are to be paced in order of priori-ty in the Table after the placement ofthe Chiefs of Staff of the DefenceServices of Bangladesh; and(8)District. Judges, Members of theJudicial Service holding equivalentjudicial posts of District Judges, addi-tional District Judges, Chief JudicialMagistrates and Chief MetropolitanMagistrates are to be paced at appr            private serial numbers in the Table ofthe new Warrant of Precedence with-out any fetters/restrictions like "withintheir respective charges” etc.102. Having regard to the discussions madeabove and in the facts and circumstances of the case,the Rule is made absolute in modified from withoutany order as to costs, The impugned Warrant of1986 (Annexure-'A' to the WritPetition) is declared to be without lawful authorityand of no legal effect. The respondent No.1 is direct-ed to make a new Warrant of Precedence in accor-dance with the 8(cight) point directives mentionedin the body of the judgment within a period of 60(sixty) days from the date of receipt of a copy there-of and to place the District Judges, Members of thejudicial Service holding equivalent judicial pots ofthe District Judges, Additional District Judges,Chief Judicial Magistrates and Chief MetropolitanMagistrates in appropriate places in the Table of thenew Warrant of Precedence.

Let the record be put up on 25-5-2010 forpassing necessary orders.104. The learned Counsel for the respondentNo.1 Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury prays for filing acertificate appeal to the Appellate Division on theground that the case involves a substantial questionof law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.The prayer is opposed by the learned Counsel forthe petitioner Mr Asaduzzaman.The substantial question of law raised in thiscase as to the interpretation of the Constitution hasalready been settled by the Appellate Division inMasdar Hossain’s case and the decision rendered inthat case is being implemented till dated and theAppellate Division is still in seisin of the matter.| Consequently, the prayer for certificate is rejected.Ed,HIGH COURT DIVISION(Criminal Miscellaneous Jurisdiction)Khondker MusaKhaled JMd Azizul Haque JJudgmentJuly Sth 2009.Salahuddin Ahmed.clitionerState........

In thisrespect, decision of our apex Court in the case ofAbdul Huque vs State reported in 60 DLR (AD) 1may profitably be quoted.Abdul Huque vs State 60 DLR (AD) 1; Abdul Hai vsState 50 DLR 551; Habib vs State 52 DLR 105; SM Has-hem vs State 1995 BLD (AD) 115 = 48 DLR (AD) 87;State vs Lailun Nahar Ekram 15 BLT (AD) 185= 62 DLR(AD) 283 & Nazrul Islam vs State 13 MLR (AD) 185 ref.AM Mahbub Uddin, Advocate—For the PetitionerMA Aziz Khan, Advocate—For the Opposite PartyNo. 2.JudgmentKhondker Musa Khaled J: On an applicationunder section 561A of the Code of CriminalProcedure, this Rule was issued calling upon theopposite party to show cause as to why the proceed-ings of ACC GR Case No. 51 of 2008 arising out ofShyampur PS Case No. | dated 1-2-2008 under see-tions 420/409 of the Penal Code, now pending in the4th Court of Additional Chief MetropolitanMagistrate, Dhaka, should not quashed, so far itrelates to the accused-petitioner, or any other orderpassed as to this Court may deem fit and proper.*Criminal Miscellaneous case No. 14333 of 2008.            2. By the said Rule issuing order all further ofproceedings of the aforesaid case were stayed,3. The faets relevant for the purpose of dispo-sal of the Rule are that Mr Mozammel Haque, Sub-Inspector of Police Shyampur Police Station lodgedFIR. bringing allegations that on 22-11-2007 healong with other members of the joint forces recov-ered in all 360 pieces of corrugated tin (Dheutin),which were allotted for distribution as relief materi-als and not for sale, from the house No, 189 Shyam-pur High School road, block No. G under the policestation Shyampur, Dhaka belonging to the owner-ship of the accused-petitioner Al-haj SalahuddinAhmed, a former Member of the Parliament. Thoserelief corrugated tins were found affixed on the roofof the accused petitioner's house and those werebrought down with the road with the help of thelabour and thereafter seized therefrom in presenceof the local witnesses. The accused-petitioner pro-cured those relief materials for distribution amongstthe local poor people, but fraudulently misappropri-ated the same and used in his own house. Accord-ingly, the accused-petitioner committed offenceunder sections 420/409 of the Penal Code.4. Since the allegations were under scheduleoffence of the Anti-Corruption Act, 2004, when thecase was under investigation by the officer of theAnti-Corruption Commission, an application undersection 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedurewas moved and this Rule was issued and stay passedas stated above. The accused-petitioner was alsogranted adinterim bail by the same Rule issuingorder dated 14-8-2008.5. MrAM Mahbub Uddin, the learned Advo-cate appearing on behalf of the accused-petitioner,submits that the allegation brought against the for-mer member of the Parliament was politically moti-vated only for harassment and humiliation. Thealleged recovery of relief materials was made on 22-11-2007 when the accused-petitioner was in cus-tody. It is contended that the relief materials wereseized from the road, a public place, and not fromthe possession of the accused-petitioner. It is furthercontended that the accused-petitioner was neverentrusted to deal with the relief materials, rather thelocal authority for allotment and distribution ofthose relief materials were responsible for misap-propriation, if any. He submits that the localGovernment officials were in fact entrusted with theresponsibility of giving allotment and distributesthose relief materials amongst the local poor deserv-ing people. It is further submitted that as an electedMember of the Parliament from the local area, theaccused-petitioner Alhaj Salauddin Ahmed mighthave only recommended for such allotment, but hewas never entrusted with the property. So, the ques-tion of criminal breach of trust does not arise at all,so far he is concerned. According to his submis-sions, there is no material in the record to show thatthe accused-petitioner was given authority for distri-bution of such relief materials.6. With reference to the case decisions repor-ed in 50 DLR 551 and 52 DLR 105, the learnedAdvocate submits that when the allegations does notdisclose any offence of cheating and criminal breachof trust, the accused-petitioner should not be com-pelled to wait till hearing of charge under section241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He sub-mits that there is no legal bar for quashment of theproceedings at the initial stage of the investigationin order to prevent abuse of the process of the Court.In support of his contention, the leamed Advocatehas referred to the case of Syed Md Hashem vs Statereported in /995 BLD (AD) 115 = 48 DLR (AD) 87and also the case of State vs Lailun Nahar Ekramreported in 15 BLT (AD) 185. So, he contends thatquashment of the case before taking cognizancecannot be treated as premature one.7. Mr MA Aziz Khan, the leamed Advocateappearing on behalf of the opposite party No, 2(Anti-Corruption Commission), submits in reply,that before taking cognizance, no criminal case, ineffect, starts; and, as such, the application under see-tion 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure forquashment of such proceeding is premature and it isat all not maintainable on this ground alone. It iscontended that no investigation process should be            hindered at the initial stage of criminal case by ini-tiating a quashment proceeding like the present one.In this respect, the learned Advocate has relief uponthe case of Abdul Huque vs State reported in 60 DLR(AD) 1. He submits that the accused-petitioner shallget sufficient opportunity to place his grievance, ifany, at the time of taking cognizance as well asframing of charge, when it would be possible toexamine investigation materials available in the casedockets. When there are stages open before the trialCourt to consider the grounds taken, the applicationfor quashment of the proceeding, being an inherentjurisdiction of the Highest Court, should not beentertained. In support of his contention, thelearned advocate has also cited the case of NazrulIslam vs State reported in 13 MLR (AD) 185, wheretheir Lordships have taken the view that where alter-'native remedy is available before any other forum,the criminal proceedings are not at all liable to bequashed at least prior to stage of hearing under sec-tion 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.8. So far merit of the case is concerned, theleamed Advocate submits further that there is alle-gation in the FIR that the accused petitioner, beinglocal Member of the Parliament, ( a Public Servant),misappropriated the relief materials which wereentrusted on him for distribution, used the same forhis own house and those materials were recoveredtherefrom. It is asserted that sufficient materialswere collected during investigation to initiate a cri-minal proceeding against the accused-petitioner, butthose are not available here. There is, however,scope for the trial Court to examine those materialsat the time of charge hearing. So, there is hardly anyscope to quash a criminal proceeding at the very ini-tial stage, when cognizance is yet to be taken.9. Pertinent question raised in the case is toexamine whether FIR discloses any fact attractingelements of the offences under sections 420/409 ofthe Penal Code or not. Admittedly, the accused-petitioner was a Member of the Parliament from theDhaka 4 constituency, in the immediate passed Par-liament of the Care Taker Government, 2007-2008.There is clear allegation in the FIR (Annexure-A)‘C45that the accused-petitioner misappropriated theseized relief materials by using the same to serve hispersonal purpose and those were recovered from hishouse No, 189, Shyampur High School Road, BlockNo.G, Shyamput, Dhaka. About 360 pieces of reliefCI sheets were recovered from the house belongingto the petitioner according to the FIR. After collect-ing those relief tins from the roof of the said house,those were kept on the road running in front of thathouse and the police seized those materials there-from by preparing seizure list in presence of wit-nesses. So, there is hardly any substance in this sub-mission that the place of seizure being a public road,the accused petitioner cannot be made responsiblefor misappropriation of those relief materials as hewas not found in possession of those relief materi-als. It is evident from the FIR that there is allegationin the following manner:It is, however, not very clear from the FIR as towhether the seized relief materials were given to theaccused-petitioner as representative of the people ofthe locality for distribution amongst the deservingpoor persons. Such question of entrustment can onlybe look into by the trial Court on examining investi-gation materials available in the case docket andalso through trial. We have no opportunity to lookinto the case docket in the present forum and thereis also little scope to deal with such controversialfacts.10. It appears that subsequent to the issuanceof this Rule, investigation has been completed andthe Anti-Corruption Commission already preparedcharge sheet on 3-9-2008 to proceed against theaccused petitioner under sections 420/409 of thePenal Code, The accused-petitioner has submittedthe certified copy of the charge sheet by filing sup-plementary affidavit on 1-7-2009, It transpires trom            the charge sheet that so many officials documentswere seized during investigation to prove the allega-tion i.e, entrustment of the relief materials. More-over, there are 17 cited witnesses including the con-cemed officials. The trial Court is expected to gothrough the materials at the time of hearing aboutthe charge under section 241A of the Code ofCriminal Procedure, The leamed Advocate for theAnti-Corruption Commission has submitted copy ofTRS ALG? Vs Fe/Qoov/Aeo Tikes 92-v-Q000issued by the Circle Officer, Tejgaon DevelopmentCircle, Dhaka, to show that the accused-petitionerwas allotted 1686 bundles of Dhautin, which werehanded over to the accused-petitioner as well. Thisis one of so many documents, which appear to havebeen seized by the Investigation officer, and theseized alamats disclose the allegation of entrustmentand cheating. Therefore, it is difficult to accept con-tention of the learned Advocate appearing on behalfof the accused-petitioner that there is no element inthe allegation attracting the offences alleged with. Itis evident from the investigation report that whenthe accused-petitioner was a Member of the Parlia-ment from the Dhaka 4 constituency, he was handedover 1686 bundles Dheutin for the purpose of distri-,bution but allegedly, he mis-appropriated thoserelief materials.11. So, we find existence prima-facie allega-tion to start a criminal proceeding and there is nosubstance in the submission that the FIR and prose-cution materials do not disclose any criminaloffence. Therefore, the case decision referred to bythe leamed advocate for the accused-petitioner inthis respect have no manner of application in thepresent case.12. It is an admitted position of fact that cog-nizance has not yet been taken in the connectedACC GR case and Rule was issued during investi-gation of this case. It is well settled by the variousdecisions of our jurisdiction that criminal proceed-ing can only be quashed after cognizance has beentaken and process issued on the accused persons.The reason is that a criminal case actually startsfrom the date of taking cognizance and issuance ofthe process. Before cognizance is taken, there is Viretually no pending criminal proceeding in the eye oflaw. So a non-existent criminal proceeding cannotbe subject matter of quashment. In this respect,recent decision of our apex Court in the case ofAbdul Huque vs State reported in 60 DLR (AD) |may profitably be quoted below:"Before taking of cognizance of a case bythe competent Court or Tribunal, a proceedingcannot be said to be pending and accordingly, aProceeding cannot be quashed unless cog-nizance in respect thereof has been taken andProcess issued".13. We have also seen reported case of /3 MLR(AD) 185 wherein proceeding for quashment ofcriminal case has been discouraged holding the viewthat before hearing under section 241A of the Codeof Criminal Procedure, a Criminal Proceeding is notliable to be quashed.14. We have also gone through the case deci-sions reported in 1995 BLD (AD) 115 and 15 BLT(AD) 185 where their Lordships held that there maybe rare cases where the High Court Division may bejustified in interfering even at the initial stage beforetaking cognizance in the proceedings under section561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But thefact of those cases does not fall within the categoryof the present one in any manner. There may berarest of rare cases, where no offence is at all dis-closed and there is no shadow of doubt that allowingcontinuation of the proceeding would be sheer abuseof the process of the Court. We do not consider it tobe a case of such category to quash the proceedingat the initial stage prior to the taking cognizanceagainst the accused-petitioner.15. Considering all these aspects, we are led tohold that the Rule issued on the application undersection 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure isnot legally sustainable.16. Accordingly, the Rule is discharged. Stayorder passed in connection with this Rule standsvacated, The concerned Magistrate is directed t0proceed with the case in accordance with law.            17. Since the accused-petitioner was enlargedon adinterim bail in connection with this case, he isdirected to surrender before the concernedMagistrate within 20 days from the date of receipt ofthis judgment by the lower Court, and pray for reg-ular bail.Send a copy of the judgment and order to theCourt below at once,Ed,HIGH COURT DIVISION(Criminal Miscellaneous Jurisdiction)AKM Fazlul Rahman J | M Fransis P Rojario aliasMd Delwar Hossain J | BabuJudgmentDecember 15th, 2009.vsOpposite Party*State......Code of Criminal Procedure (Vv of 1898)Section 561ASection 561A of the Code of Criminal Proce-dure can exercise its inherent jurisdiction forquashing a proceeding of a criminal case firstlyto make such orders as may be necessary to giveeffect to any order of the Code, secondly to pre-vent abuse of the process of the Court and lastlyotherwise to secure ends of justice. +(10)Samabaya Samity Ain (XLVI of 2001)Sections 83 & 86Samabaya Biddimala, 2004Rule 159Code of Criminal Procedure (Vv of 1898)Section 561AInitiation of the criminal case at the instanceof the present complainant/informant withouttaking recourse of the procedures provided inSamabaya Samity Ain, 2001, is not maintainablein law.

At the time of issuance of the Rule, all fur-ther proceedings of the case were stayed for a limit-ed period, which subsequently has been extendedfrom time to time.3. Dilip Piuri Fikeson (Lorance) as com-plainant filed a petition of complaint on 10-6-2007in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,Dhaka against the accused petitioners alleging thathe is the Member being No. 884 of The Metropoli-tan Christian Co-operative Housing Society Limitedof Church Community Centre, 9, Tejkuni Para,Tejgaon, Dhaka. The said Society was formed in1977 to solve the residential problems of its mem-bers having about 8000 members presently who areall beneficiary members. The accused persons arefraud, cheat and commit criminal breach of trust ofentrustment of the property. While the accused per-sons were discharging their functions as office bear-ers of the managing committee of the said Societyfrom 2003 to 2006 took a decision on 17-9-2006 tosell the property to out side in contravention of theconstitution of the ‘Society. On 18-10-2006 theaccused petitioner No. 1 and 3 sold 25.25 acres ofland of the Society at Mouza Kandar within policestation Mirpur to witness No. 1, Saiful Alam for aconsideration money of Taka 3,53,50,000 by exe-cuting and registering the Sale Deed No. 8871 dated18-10-2006 and handed over possession of the landto the said purchaser, Saiful Alam. the accused peti-tioner Nos. | and 3 deposited Taka 1,59,00,000 inthe Society and misappropriated the rest money ofTaka 1,94,50,000. The complainant obtaining thecertified copy of the sale deed filed the case.4. The learned Magistrate examining thecomplainant under section 200 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure sent the petition of complaint tothe Officer-in-Charge of Tejgaon Police Station totreat the same as first information report. On receiptof the complaint it was recorded as Tejgaon PoliceStation Case No. 48 dated 21-7-2007 under sections406/408/409/420/34 of the Penal Code against theaccused petitioners. The accused petitioners wereenlarged on bail by this Court in CriminalMiscellaneous Case No. 13056 of 2007.5. The accused petitioners then moved thisCourt with this application under section 561A ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing theimpugned proceedings and obtained the rule on 24-9-2007 and further proceedings of the case wasstayed.6. Mr Khair Ezaz Masood, the learnedAdvocate with Mr Kazi Joynal Abedin, Advocateappearing for the accused petitioners submits thatthe accused petitioners are the office bearers andgeneral members of The Metropolitan Christian co-operative Housing society Ltd (shortly the Society).He submits that the accused petitioners transferredthe land according to the constitution and by laws ofthe Society and approved by the Registrar of Co-operative Society. He referring to sections 83 and86 of Samabaya Samity Ain, 2001 and Rule 159 ofSamabaya Samity Bhidimala, 2004 submits that incase of criminal offence relating to any co-operativesociety being non-cognizable offence notwithstand-ing any thing contained in the Code of CriminalProcedure, no Court shall take cognizance of anysuch offence without written complaint either fromthe Registrar of the Co-operative Society or by anyperson authorised by him. In the instant case thecomplaint subsequently treated as first informationreport filed by the complainant/ informant, a privateparty, without any authority under the SamabayaSamity Ain, 2001. Thus he submits that since thecase is not maintainable being barred by law the pro-ceeding can be quashed at its initial stage. He insupport of his contention cited the decisions in thecases of Abdul Quader Chowdhury vs State reportedin 28 DLR (AD) 38, Nasiruddin Mahmud vsMomtazuddin Ahmed reported in 36 DLR (AD) 14.Faridul Alam vs State reported in 61 DLR (AD) 93.Afia Khatoon vs Mobasswir Ali reported in 1995BLT (AD) 74 = 47 DLR (AD) 62 State vs Lailun            Nahar Ekram, reported in 2007 BLD (AD) 18 andCN Rudramurthy vs Barkathullah Khan reported in(1998) 8 SCC 275, He also submits that accordingto the Doctrine of Stare Decisis a long standingdecision of the court which has been consistentlyapproved and followed by the Appellate Division inthe aforesaid decisions, should also be followed bythis Court, He thus finally submits that the instantproceedings of the case is not maintainable againstthe accused petitioners being barred by law andshould be quashed.7. Mr Zahirul Haque Zahir, the learnedDeputy Attorney-General with Mr Md AbdulKhaleque, Mr AKM Zahirul Haque and MsSharmina Hug Assistant Attorney-General appear-ing for the opposite party submits that in the instantcase police has not yet submitted the police reportconcluding investigation and that since cognizancehas not been taken by the Court against the accused-petitioners, there is no proceeding pending. He sub-mits that as there is no proceeding pending againstthe accused petitioners, question of quashment doesnot arise presently. To support his submission hereferred to the decision in the case of Abdul Huquevs State reported in 60 DLR (AD) J. He thus sub-mits that the rule should be discharged on theground of pre-maturity.8. We have heard the submissions of thelearned Advocates and perused the first informationreport annexed with the application for quashment.9. Before we proceed with the case we like toquote the provision of section 561A of the Code ofCriminal Procedure to examine its scope which runsas follows:"561A. Nothing in this Code shall bedeemed to limit or affect the inherent power ofthe High Court Division to make such orders asmay be necessary to give effect to any orderunder this Code, or to prevent abuse of process ofany Court or otherwise to secure ends of justice."10. High Court Division under section 561A ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure can exercise itsinherent jurisdiction for quashing a proceeding of acriminal case firstly to make such orders as may benecessary to give effect to any order of the Code,secondly to prevent abuse of the process of theCourt and lastly otherwise to secure ends of justice,11. Appellate Division in several occasionssettled the scope of jurisdiction of the High CourtDivision for quashment of a Criminal proceedingunder section 561A of the CrPC.In the case of Abdul Quader Chowdhury vsState reported in 28 DLR (AD) 38 it has been held:"Interference even at initial stage may bejustified where the facts are so preposterous thateven on the admitted facts no case can standagainst the accused and that a further prolonga-tion of the prosecution would amount to harass-ment to an innocent party and abuse of processof the Court. Besides, some categories of casesmay also be indicated where the inherent juris-diction can and should be exercised for quash-ing the proceeding. There may be cases whereit may be possible for the High Court to take theview that the institution or continuation of crim-inal proceedings against an accused person mayamount to the abuse of the process of the Court orthat the quashing of the impugned proceedingswould secure the ends of justice. If the criminalproceeding in question is in respect of an offencealleged to have been committed by an accusedperson and it manifestly appears that there is alegal bar against the institution or continuance ofthe said proceedings the High Court would bejustified in quashing the proceedings on thatground. Cases may also arise where the allega-tions in the first information report or complainteven if they are taken at their face value andaccepted in their entirety, do not constitute theoffence alleged, in such cases no question ofappreciating evidence arises, it is a matter ofmerely looking at the complaint or first informa-tion report to decide whether the offence allegedis disclosed or not. In such cases it would belegitimate for the High Court to hold that it wouldbe manifestly unjust to allow process of the crim-inal Court to be issued against the accused per-son. A third category of cases in which the inher-            ent jurisdiction of the High Court can be invokedmay also arise, In cases falling under thisgory the allegations made against the accusedperson do constitute an offence alleged but thereis either no legal evidence adduced in support ofthe ease or the evidence adduced clearly or man-ifestly fails to prove the charge,12. In the case of Ali Akkas vs Enayet Hossainreported in 1997 BLD (AD) 44 = 2 BLC (AD) 16Appellate Division approving the aforesaid decisionreiterated the categories of following cases wherethe High Court Division should interfere to quash acriminal proceeding:"(1) Interference even at an initial stagemay be justified where the facts are so prepos-terous that even on the admitted facts no casecan stands against the accused.(2) Where institution or continuance ofcriminal proceedings against an accused personmay amount an abuse of the process of theCourt or when the quashing of the impugnedproceedings would secure the ends of justice.(3) Where there is a legal bar against insti-tution or continuance of a criminal case againstaccused persons.(4) In a case where the allegations in thefirst information report or the complaint, even ifthey are taken at their face value and acceptedin their entirety, do not constitute the offencealleged and in such cases no question of weigh-ing and appreciating evidence arises.(5) The allegations made against theaccused person do constitute an offence allegedbut there is either no legal evidence adduced insupport of the case or the evidence adducedclearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge."13. These views have consistently beenapproved and followed by the Appellate Division inthe cases of Bangladesh vs Tan Kheng Hock report-ed in 31 DLR (AD) 69, N Mahmud vs M Ahmedreported in 36 DLR (AD) 14 = 1984 BLD (AD) 97,Syed Mohammad Hashem alias Hashim reported in48 DLR (AD) 87 and Faridul Alam vs State report-ed in 6) DLR (AD) 93.14. The consensus of judicial opinion is thatproceedings of a criminal case can be quashed bythe High Court Division in exercise of its inherentjurisdiction under section 561A of the Code even atinitial stage when it appears that there is a legal baragainst the institution or continuance of the case.15. In the case in hand the question raised is thatthe case is barred by law pursuant to section 86 of theSamabaya Samity Ain, 2001 which reads as under:16. Section 86(1) of the aforesaid Ain 2001,provides that any punishable offence relating to theaffairs of the co-operative society is non-cognizableoffence notwithstanding anything contained in theCode of Criminal Procedure. Section 86(2) of theAin provides that no Court shall take cognizance ofany offence under the Ain 2001 without a writtencomplaint filed either by the Registrar of the Co-operative Society or any person authorized by him.17. On perusal of the petition of complaintsubsequently treated as first information report itappears that allegations brought against the accusedpetitioners that they sold the land of theMetropolitan Christian Co-operative society Ltd incontravention of the constitution of the said Societyand misappropriated a substantial part of the consid-eration money to the tune of Taka 1,94,50,000. Thealleged offence is punishable under section 83 of thesaid Ain, 2001. Rule 159 of Samabaya SamityBidhimala 2004 prescribes the procedures forenquiry of the offence committed under section 83of the Ain, 2001. On enquiry if the allegation isproved, the Registrar of the Co-operative Society orany person authorised by him shall file a petition ofcomplaint in writing before the competent Court.            18. In the instant case it appears that for thealleged offence of sale of the land of the society incontravention of the constitution and by laws of theSociety and misappropriation of substantial part ofthe consideration money by the accused petitionersthe complainant/ informant without invoking provi-sions of the Samabaya Samity Ain, 2001 has filedthe petition of complaint in the Court of ChiefMetropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka who sent the peti-tion of complaint to Tejgaon Police Station to treatthe same as first information report.19. Pursuant to section 86 of the Ain, 2001 thepesent complainant/informant had no lawful authori-yt file a petition of complaint. Thus initiation of theinstant criminal case at the instance of the presentcomplainanvVinformant without taking recourse of theprocedures provided in Samabaya Samity Ain, 2001,is not maintainable in law. Since initiation of theinstant case is barred by law, this Court in exercise ofits jurisdiction under section 561A of the CrPC canquash the proceeding at its initial stage before takingcognizance thereof. Our this view gets support fromthe decision in the case of Kazi Forhad Hossain vs MdGolam Mostafa Sarwar reported in 2007 BLD (AD)47 wherein allowing quashment of the Proceedings, ithas been held as under:- since the petition of complaint/first information report contains allegations offiling and use of forged document in the pro-ceedings of a suit, the initiation of the criminalproceeding for forgery at the instance of thecomplainant petitioner without taking recourseof the procedure provided in section 195(1)(c)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is barred.”20. The case of Abdul Haque vs State reportedin 60 DLR (AD) | cited by the learned DeputyAttomey-General, wherein the Appellate Divisionhas held as under:"Before taking cognizance of a case by thecompetent Court or tribunal a proceeding can-not be said to be pending and accordingly, aproceeding cannot be quashed unless cog-nizance in respect thereof has been taken andprocess issued......... "21. We are in respectful agreement with theprinciples enunciated in 60 DLR (AD) I that a pro-ceeding cannot be quashed unless cognizance jstaken thereof. Their Lordships while settling theaforesaid principles discussed the earlier decisionsin the cases reported in 3/ DLR (AD) 69, 36 DLR(AD) 14 and 48 DLR (AD) 87. In those decisions theproposition of law settled earlier that a proceedinginitiated if barred by law can be quashed even at ini-tial stage, that his, at the stage of investigation hasnot been disapproved.22. The "Doctrine of Stare Decisis" postulatesthat a long-standing decision of the Court which hasconsistently been followed should not be upturned.When a decision has been followed in several cases,its binding effect should not be disturbed merely onthe ground that any particular aspect had not beenexpressly considered therein. To support this viewwe may refer to the case of Abdul Motaleb vs ImanAli Mollah reported in 42 DLR (AD) 123 wherein ithas been held that an established precedent handeddown by past judges.23. So, we are of the considered view that thedecision of 60 DLR (AD) 1 is quite distinguishableand not applicable in the facts and circumstances ofthe instant case. As we have found that the pro-ceedings of the instant case are barred by law, isliable to be quashed even at the initial stage beforetaking cognizance.24. In the result, the Rule is made absolute.25.

In the writ petition, it has been stated that therespondent No, 2 Bangladesh (Freedom Fighters)Welfare Trust constituted for the Welfare of the free.dom fighters and particularly the disabled (inca.pable of pursuing any normal vocation because ofinjuries suffered during the war of liberation) free.dom fighters, their dependants and dependants ofthe Martyrs of the War of Liberation and to provideassistance for their livelihood and rehabilitation,3. In exercise of power under PO No. 94 of1972 the Board of Trustees in charge with the man.agement of the trust, promulgated Bangladesh(Freedom Fighters) Welfare Trust Regulation in1984 in order to regulate the affairs of the Trust con-cerning the rehabilitation of disabled freedom fight-ers through proper listing and ensuring payment ofbenefits and allowance to them. The injuredFreedom Fighters applied for their enlistment as dis-abled freedom fighters at different times during1997 and 1998 and the authority, after proper scruti-ny found the petitioners as Genuine freedom fight-ers and also found them as disabled due to injuriesreceived at the time of Liberation War of 1971 andthereafter, the respondents being satisfied started togive the State Honorarium benefit to the petitionersand the petitioners had been receiving their honorar-ium from the date of granting honorarium of therespective date. All on a sudden, in the middle panof 2003, the respondents without assigning any rea-sons or asking the petitioners to show cause or serv-ing in a notice the payment of honorarium wasstopped and since then, they have been depriving in |getting the honorarium.4. The petitioners, then filed several applica-tions and representations before the tespondent No.2 for payment of the honorarium/ remuneration butthe respondent No. 2 did not give any reply. Thepetitioners, then realized that individually they shallnot be able to compel the Tespondents to pay theirhonorarium, then they formed an Association in thename of “Bangladesh Juddahato Muktijoddha |Rashtrio Sommani Bhata Bastobayon Parishad” andthe president of the Association made several Tepre-sentations before the respondent No. 2 and others            for giving their remuneration w hich they had beenenjoying but the respondents did not consider therepresentations and ultimately, the petitioners filedthis writ petition and after hearing the learnedAdvocate for the petitioners, the Rule was issued asaforesaid.5. The respondent No. 2 BangladeshMuktijoddha Kallayan Trust, represented by theManaging Director submitted affidavitin-opposi-tion.6. In the affidavit in opposition, it has been stat-ed that 62 petitioners such as 8, 17, 18, 27, 28, 30,32, 34, 39, 41, 43, 45, 46,47, 50, 51, 52, 56, 59, 63,64, 66, 69, 72, 76, 7, 80, 101, 102, 103, 104, 106,123, 124, 125, 126, 132, 135, 141, 144, 149, 150,152, 154, 155, 156, 158, 173, 175, 177, 178, 184,188, 189, 191, 196, 204, 205, 219, 220, 222 and 229were found 0% disability after medical test and thatpetitioner No. 219 is shown twice that is the sameperson is also shown at serial no. 229 with 0% per-son disability. The petitioner Nos. 40, 110, 119, 134,157, 206 and 207 having disability 1 % to 19 % arereceiving allowance at the rate of Taka 1350 permonth. Petitioner’s No. 44 having disability at 45%has been receiving at the rate of Taka 6750 thoughearlier he had received Taka 2004 per month. Thepetitioner No. 66 after retirement from governmentservice is drawing pension and he is known as reha-bilitated disabled freedom fighter, according to reg-ulation 1984.7. The petitioner No, 223 was absent in med-ical test and as such, his allowance was stopped. Thepetitioners intentionally are not receiving the allot-ted allowance at the rate of Taka 1350 though 7 peti-tioners have been receiving Taka 1350 of the samecategory.8. The petitioners No. 129 Md Kamrul Islamfiled another writ petition No. 5825 of 2008 alongwith others. Jamshed Ali the petitioner No. 203 ofthis writ petition filed Title Suit No. 142 of 2009 inthe Court of Assistant Judge, 5th Court, Dhakawhich is pending. It has been further stated that thePetitioners obtained the Rule suppressing the factsHC 46but the respondents never stopped the allowthe petitioners but stopped the allowances who havebeen found fake freedom fighters and also thosewho were found having no disability after medicaltest, according to ‘Regulation’ 2002 and also whodid not appear before the Medical Board and that therespondents are disbursing the allowance accordingto the provisions laid down in PO 94 of 1972,‘Regulation’ 1984 and 2004 and the petitioners havefiled this writ petition with malafide intention forobtaining allowances violating the provisions oflaw.ances of9. The respondent No. 2 also filed a supple-mentary affidavit on 8-7-2009 quoting the ‘Regu-lation’ (circular) 2002. This Regulation indicatesthat 6 members committee headed by BrigadierGeneral Ali Akbar had been formed for making rec-ommendation for the disabled Freedom Fighters forgiving honorarium and also to fix the percentage ofdisabilities who will be allowed honorarium havingregard to the Regulation 2002. Which in verbatim isreproduced to below :10. An affidavit-in-reply has been filed by thepetitioners against the affidavit-in-opposition filedon behalf of the respondent No. 2. The petitioners inthe reply denied the allegations and statements madein the affidavit-in-opposition and stated that thealleged disability at the rate of 0% shown is vagueand unspecified in respect of 62 petitioners and stat-ed further that the petitioners Nos. 40, 110, 119, 134,157, 206 and 207 are entitled to receive theallowance at the rate of Taka 5,625 but these peti-tioners were receiving allowance at the reduced ratefor their necessity before the issuance of Rule andthat petitioner No. 49 is receiving at the rate of Taka6750 after issuance of Rule in the writ petition andthat there is no bar in receiving the allowance by apensioner and denied the allegation made in para-graph No. 19 that the petitioners are not receivingthe allowance intentionally and urged to delete thename of the petitioner shown at serial No. 129 as hefiled another writ petition; and that the petitionerNo. 203 is entitled to receive honorarium as the TitleSuit No. 142 of 2009 is not maintainable in law andalso submitted that the petitioner will withdraw thesuit. In the affidavit-in-reply, it has also been statedthat the petitioners had appeared before the authori-ty in 1999 for medical check up as to their disabili-ty and they were found disabled after examinationand accordingly, granted State honorarium benefitand since then, they had been receiving the honorar-ium till stoppage of the same during 2003 by theBNP—Jamaat alliance Government and the respon-dents most illegally reopened the so-called medicalproceeding with a view to deprive the petitionersfrom the benefit though legally granted honorariumfrom 1995 to 1999. It has been further submittedthat the respondents have violated the principle ofnatural justice in not giving an opportunity of beingheard before stopping the allowance and had mostillegally stopped the allowances in 2003 which isnot sustainable in law.11. One Mr Md Golam Mostafa posing himselfas freedom fighter has submitted an application forbeing added respondent No. 5 in the instant writpetition and accordingly, he was added respondentNo. 5 by order dated 25-11-2008. He has not filedany affidavitin-opposition. In the application, he hasannexed Annexure-X-X(10). In the application for            addition of party the added respondent No.5 statedthat the writ petitioner No, 159 Md. Golam Nabi isa fake freedom fighter which has been revealedfrom the file of the respondent No. 2 inasmuch as anote has been reproduced in the application to thateftect. It has been stated further that the name ofpetitioner No. 159 should be struck down from theRoll of freedom fighters as he is a fake FreedomFighter.12. Mr Syed Haider Ali, the learned Advocateappearing for the petitioners has placed the writpetition and the Annexure so annexed with the writtition, affidavitinopposition filed by the respon-dent No, 2, and the supplementary affidavit,Aflidavit-in-reply filed by the petitioners and sub-mitted that after examining all the required docu-ments and in compliance of all required formalitiesand after being satisfied, the petitioners were sclect-edas disabled freedom fighters having regard to theprovision of PO 94 and 159 of 1972 and the rulesand procedure there under. The petitioners wereallowed State Honorarium and they had been receiv-ing from 1995 which has been shown in theAnnexure-‘C’ to the writ petition and subsequentBNP—Jamaat alliance Government had stopped thehonorarium from middle of 2003 (June 2003) with-out giving any show cause notice and without hear-ing the petitioners and thereby, violated the principleof natural justice and as such, the order stopping thehonorarium be declared to have stopped arbitrarily,unconstitutionally and without lawful authority. Hesubmitted further that the disabilities of the petition-ers had been determined and confirmed and beingsatisfied of their disabilities and after observing dueprocess of law paid state honorarium and in theprocess, they acquired a vested right to their stateremuneration as freedom fighters and stopping thepayment unilaterally, the respondents have actedarbitrarily and such arbitrary action be declared tohave been made without lawful authority and is ofno legal effect. The learned Advocate further sub-mitted that the respondents have violated the princi-ple of natural justice in stopping the StateHonorarium without letting them know of their faultand as such, their malafide action needs be declaredto have taken illegally, without lawful authority andis of no legal effect. He again submitted that stop-ping of State Honorarium to the petitioners who arefreedom fighters is illegal and to have stopped vio-lating the rights guaranteed under Article-27 and 31of the Constitution and such action of the respon-dents is liable to be declared to have been madewithout lawful authority and is of no legal effect. Hesubmitted further that it is now well settled principlethat once the privilege is given, it can not be takenaway without due of process of law and thereby, therespondents stopping the honorarium have actedwithout lawful authority and the same is of no legaleffect. The learned Advocate has drawn our atten-tion to the Annexure-G and submitted that one of theDivisions of this Court on a similar matter declaredthe actions inasmuch as stopping the “RastrioSammani Bhata” of the petitioners was illegal andwithout lawful authority and the Rule was madeabsolute on 7-6-2007 in WP No. 2183 of 2004.13. The learned Advocate then refers toAnnexure-"G1” to the writ petition, the judgment ofthe Appellate Division passed in Civil Petition forLeave to Appeal No. 1157-61 of 2007 which arosefrom judgments and orders dated 7-6-2007 passedby the High Court Division in writ petition Nos.753/05, 31860/04, 2183/04, 3362/04 and 4339/04and submitted that the judgments and orders passedby the High Court Division were not interferedrather affirmed by the Appellate Division.14. Mr JK Paul, the leamed Advocate for therespondent No. 2 in disagreeing with the submis-sions of the leaned Advocate for the petitioners hassubmitted that the petitioners by suppressing thefacts obtained the Rule but the respondents have notstopped the State Honorarium of the petitioners butonly stopped the honorarium of those who werefound to be fake freedom fighters after investigationand of the petitioners, who have no disability aftermedical test according to the regulation (circular)2002 and also of those who did not appear before theMedical Board and that the respondent performs             their function as per provisions laid down PO94/1972, Regulation of 1984 and 2002 and prayedfor discharging the Rule.18. We have considered the Annexures,annexed to the writ petition, Annexure-A is the pres-ident’s order No. 94 of 1972 by which Bangladesh(freedom fighters) Welfare Foundation was createdfor welfare of the disabled freedom fighters, anddependants of shaheeds of war of liberation, it con-tains among others in Rule 3(2) “(F) to sanctionpension to such beneficiaries as are unable to pursuenormal vocations”. Annexure-B is the Rules madeunder Bangladesh (Freedom Fighter) WelfareFoundation which has been promulgated to managethe affairs of the Welfare Trust having regard to theprovision of PO 94 of 1972.Rule 6 of Bangladesh (Freedom Fighters)Welfare Trust Rules 1984.16. On scrutiny of the list of the FreedomFighters (Annexure-’C’) it appears that the Statehonorarium was sanctioned and paid to FreedomFighters from the date mentioned against theirrespective name including 62 persons who has beenallegedly have 0% disability rather they have no dis-ability to be entitled to receive the State Honorariumhas got no basis, In coming to such findings theTespondent No. 2 has not stated the age of the free-dom fighters though they by now attained more than60 years who incurred natural disabilities andunable to earn their livelihood and in such circum-stances, finding as to disability does not stand. Wefind that such findings have got no rational basis forwhich such contention as to disability does not ten-able in law, which has been made with ulteriormotive behind the knowledge of the 62 persons.17. Petitioner Nos. 40, 110, 119 and 134, 157,206 and 207 are entitled to receive honorarium at therate of Taka 5,625. The petitioners were receiving atthe reduce rate for their necessity before issuance ofRule which is being reflected from the A ffidavit-in-reply and similarly, it appears from the reply that thepetitioner No. 49 is receiving allowance afterissuance of Rule. We do not find any provision inthe PO 94 of 1972, the Regulation of 1984 to havemade debarring a pensioner to get StateHonorarium.18. In the affidavit-in-reply, the petitioners haveurged to allow the petitioners to delete the serial No,219 and accordingly, the petitioners are allowed todelete the same and after delation SI No. 229 theperson shown in serial No. 219 will be entitled to getthe benefit. The name of the petitioner No. 129 isallowed to be deleted from the serial No. 129 asprayed for as he filed separate writ petition.19. Upon further scrutiny of the president orderand the Rules there under, we do not find any provi-sion for 2nd time medical test of the FreedomFighters who were once found disabled.20. Annexure-’G’ is the judgment and orderpassed in the writ petition No. 2183 of 2004, whereone of us (Mr Justice ABM Khairul Haque) is partyto the judgment. On close reading of the judgment,it appears that their Lordships had dealt with thesimilar facts and laws on the subject and uponscrutiny of the PO 94 of 1972 and Rules of 1984 andother papers relating to the grant of StateHonorarium had made the Rule absolute and givendirection to the respondents to cause payment ofState Honorarium from June 2003 and also to payarrears to the petitioners of WP No. 2183 of 2004.21, The relevant observations made in thejudgment are reproduced below :             “It is a matter of surprise, that after longlapse of 32 years, the degree of disabilities ofthe petitioners were again determined by theCommittee and pursuant to the report dated 31-3-2003 (Annexure-X-3), the “Rastrio SammaniBhata” of the petitioners were stopped.Admittedly, before passing the impugnedorders, the petitioners were not served anynotice or show cause, against the proposedaction. They were not given any opportunity tobe heard. Natural Justice requires that before aperson is punished an opportunity to showcause against the proposed punishment shouldbe afforded to him.The essential feature of the principle ofnatural justice is that no person should bedeprived of his right without hearing before anindependent authority. Its purpose is to preventmiscarriage of justice.The concept of natural justice cannot beconfined to any precise definition. It is not jus-tice in the abstract or moral sense and is noteven justice accordingly to natural law. Theessential feature of the principle of natural jus-tice is simply that no person shall be deprivedof any vested right by any order, judicial or oth-erwise without a hearing before an independentauthority not interested in the proceedings or inany party to the proceedings.In the case of Saiyyid Abul A'la Maudoodivs Government of West Pakistan, reported in 17DLR (SC) 209 = PLD, 1964 (SC) 673 whereinit is held :Principle of audi alteram partem is applica-ble to administrative orders—The principle ofnatural justice requiring a hearing to be grantedto a person before being condemned, appliesnot only to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedingbut also to administrative proceeding providedthat the relevant statute does not exclude itsapplication and requires the administrativeauthority concerned to base its decision on anobjective determination of facts.”22. Against the judgment and order of the HighCourt Division passed in several writ petitionsrespondent No. 2 preferred Civil Petition for leaveto appeal being No. 1157-61 of 2007 and theirLordships of the Appellate Division held“We called upon the learned Counsel rep-resenting the leave petitions to address theCourt as regard the finding of the High CourtDivision that the writ petitioners were paidHonorarium/Rastrio Sammani Bhata for 32years in the light of the list prepared and pub-lished in the official gazette and that before tak-ing the impugned action i.e. canceling, curtail-ing, reducing or stopping payment ofHonorarium/ Rastrio Sammani Bhata whetherthe writ petitions were heard or that they weregiven opportunity to establish the fact that theywere and are the Freedom Fighters and to estab-lish that earlier they were listed as FreedomFighters since they established that fact, i.e.,Freedom Fighters, by reliable materials.The learned Counsel for the petitionerscould not refer to any materials or in otherwords from the materials as are in the paperbooks of the respective petitions for leave toappeal nor could produce any materials toestablish that before taking the action in respec-tive of the writ petitioners, who establishedtheir right to receive Honorarium/RastrioSammani Bhata as Freedom Fighters afterbeing listed in the list of Freedom Fighters pub-lished in the official gazette and enjoyed thesaid right for the last 32 years without interrup-tion or question from any corner. In the aforestate of the matter we are of the view of HighCourt Division was not in error in making theRules absolute upon arriving at the finding thatthe writ petitioners of the respective writ peti-tions were deprived of their establish right ofreceiving the honorarium/Rastrio SammaniBhata in an whimsical and capricious mannerand that action impugned i.e, cancellation/ cur-tailment/reduction/stop/nonpayment of theHonorarium was a malafide action of the Writ            Respondents and same manifest from the natureand kind of the action complained of and is evi-dent from the materials on record. The materi-als in the paper books clearly demonstrate thatthe action was anything but not fair since thewrit petitioners were deprived of the benefits,which they acquired upon establishment of thefact of their being Freedom Fighters and theywere paid for the 32 years, of receivingHonorarium/Rastrio Sammani Bhata in totaldisregard of the universally accepted principleof natural justice or in other words withouthearing them or affording opportunity to placetheir case, and the action impugned was takento their prejudice keeping them in dark.The learned Counsels for the writ petition-er-respondents submitted that the action com-plained of was a motivated one and that theaction impugned in the writ petitions wasparochial as well as suffered from bad faith andas such, the High Court Division was correct indeclaring action of the writ respondents illegaland of no legal effect.The submission of the learned Counsels ofthe writ petitioner-respondents in the back-ground of the nature and kind of the actioncomplained of as well as the materials on recordappears to be of merit and thus worth consider-ation.In view of the discussion made hereinbefore we are of the opinion that the judgmentsof the High Court Division sought to be appealedcall for no interference by this division.Accordingly, petitions are dismissed.”23. The contention raised by the added respon-dent No, 5 as to petitioner No, 159—Md GolamNabi is vague and based on disputed question offacts. The affidavit-in-opposition filed by therespondent No, 2 Bangladesh MuktijoddhaKallayan Trust does not disclose any objection tohave taken by the respondent No, 2 as to petitionerNo. 159 Md Golam Nabi. The determination as tothe genuineness of a Freedom Fighter is the exclu.sive domain of the government and the respondentNo, 2 Bangladesh Muktijoddha Kallayan Trust anqas such, we cannot accept the submission of theadded respondent No. 5.24. It has been noticed that before stopping thehonorarium of the petitioners had not served anynotice or asked them to show cause as to why thehonorarium shall not be stopped. It appears furtherthe petitioners were not given any fair opportunityof being heard and thus action stopping the honorar-ium is ex facie violative of the principle of naturaljustice. Whatever action has been taken by way ofstopping the State Honorarium is without lawfulauthority and of no legal effect.25. It is now well settled principle of law thatonce the privilege is given that cannot be taken awaywithout due process of law and this principle isapplicable in this case as no opportunity was afford-ed to the petitioners before curtailing the opportuni-ty that is the stopping of the State Honorarium to thepetitioners.26. Before parting with the case, we feel tempt-ed to make certain observations regarding the wel-fare of the valiant Freedom Fighters. We havenoticed with great concern that the affairs of theFreedom Fighters had been dealt with during BNP-Jamaat regime apparently with the ulterior motive todeprive the Freedom Fighters, the great sons of thesoil who undoubtedly sacrificed their lives for thecause of the ‘Nation’. We feel with profound respectto the Freedom Fighters that the sacred soil ofBangladesh had been liberated by the FreedomFighters out of their blood and dedication (including30 lacs Shaheeds) and resultantly, we achieved aFree Nation, Constitution, Flag and Nation:Anthem. Our Freedom Fighters who have comeback from the Death Valley with the grace of |Almighty. Now, the duty of the Nation is to nourishthe Freedom Fighters with utmost dignity and hon-our and to that end in view PO 94 of 1972 ie,BANGLADESH (Freedom Fighters) WelfareFoundation Order 1972 had promulgated for the            Welfare of the disabled Freedom Fighters anddependants of the shaheeds and thereafter, Rulesframed there under in 1984 to render smooth servic-es to the disabled Freedom Fighters and the depen-dants of the shaheeds, Government from time totime granted State Honorarium to the petitioners, thedisabled Freedom Fighters from 1995-1999 andpaid the honorarium till June 2003. BNP-Jamaatalliance Government had stopped the honorarium onthe basis of the Regulation (Circular) dated 31-3-2002. It is evident from the above quoted Circularthat BNP-Jamaat Government introduced certainterms in the Circular and introducing derogatoryterm in the circular had constituted Medical Boardfor Medical Test and thereafter, resorting to suchdevice had stopped the honorarium of the disabledFreedom Fighters. We consider such device hasbeen made to deprive the disabled Freedom Fightersfrom their honorarium and such method of depriva-tion should be condemned and castigated and suchtools/device has been introduced as a process ofexclusion of the disabled Freedom Fighters fromtheir right of honorarium. We feel, it should bestopped/shunned once for all. The Nation shouldrespect the valiant Freedom Fighters at large for alltime to come. The State (Bangladesh) should alwaysbe kept in striving to create new avenues for theWelfare of the Freedom Fighters. We should not for-get their contribution for the establishment of theNation and the thousands of people are movingaround the world as a proud Bangladeshi(Bangalee).

The plaintiff Ibrahim Molla instituted TitleSuit No. 38 of 1998 in the Court of Assistant Judge,Sadarpur, Faridpur on 28-4-1998, against the dedant No. 1 Naimuddin Molla @ Naba Molla and theGovernment of Bangladesh as defendant No. 2 pray-ing for specific performance of contract, stating,inter alia, that the defendant No. 1 NaimuddinMolla had obtained settlement of a landed propertyas a landless person on 17-1-1979 from the govern-ment of Bangladesh, defendant No. 2, which was akhas property recorded in khas khatian No. 1, meauring 1.32 acres of land comprised in Plot No. 1334and 1193 within mouza Krishnapur, under SadarpurUpazila, Faridpur. The defendant No. | thereattermutated his name in the relevant record of right andpaid the rent and taxes to the government in his ownname and while possessing the same, he proposed tosell a portion of the said property, hereinafter becalled the suit property, measuring an area of 1.02            acres to the plaintiff at a consideration of Taka25,000. Thereafter a Bainapatra was executed inbetween the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff on 17-53-1994 upon payment of camest money of Taka20,000 to the defendant No. 1 by the plaintiff anddelivery of possession of the suit property to theplaintifY was made by the defendant No. 1. It wasstipulated in the Bainapatra that after a period of 3years the plaintiff will pay the balance considerationmoney of Taka 5,000 and the defendant No. 1 willexecute and register the suf-kabala finalising thesale. Later defendant No. 1, although received thesaid balance consideration money of Taka 5,000from the plaintiff, but refused to execute and regis-ter the suf-kabala in favour of the plaintiff. In themeantime the defendant No. 1 and his sons dispos-sessed him from a portion of a suit property, hencethe suit.3. The defendant No. 1 Naimuddin Mollahcontested the suit by filing written statement, deny-ing all material allegations raised in the plaint andadmitting his right, title and possession in the suitproperty but denied the execution of any Bainapatraon 17-5-1994 in favour of the plaintiff upon accept-ing Taka 20,000 as earnest money or any receipt ofTaka 5,000 later, towards the finalisation of the saleof the suit property. He further asserted, in the writ-ten statement, that neither he handed over the pos-session of the suit property to the plaintiff nor plain-uff got any interest pursuant to the said so-calledBainapatra allegedly executed by defendant No. 1.Further the defendant No. 1 asserted that he alreadytransferred 0.13 acres of land by registered deed ofgifi, dated 4-2-1995, in favour of his son BadshaMolla out of suit plot No. 1193 who erected his res-idential house and living therein. Later the defen-dant No. | again on 4-2-1995 gifted away another0.13 acres of land out of the suit property to hisaforesaid son Badsha Molla and further gifted away0.06'/, acres of land to his grandson Miraj Molla on1-2-1995 through registered deed of gift and handedOver possession to them which was registered on 21-12-1997, Later, the defendant No. | also sold 0.6',acres of land to his son's wife Rowshan Ara Begumwe = Eeeon 4-2-1995 through registered deed. As such, hisson, son's wife and grandson are now owner in Pos-session in 0.26 acres of land in the suit plots. Thedefendant No. 1 categorically asserted that theBainapatra alleged to have been written on stamppaper dated 21-12-1978 with denomination 0.75Taka is a forged one and he did not execute the sameby putting his LTI on the same.4. After the filing of the written statement theplaintiff amended his plaint and added defendantNos. 3-5 in the suit who are the aforesaid son's wifeand grandson of the defendant No. 1. Later thedefendant Nos. 1, 4 and 5, by filing an additionalwritten statement, asserted that the defendant No. 3Badsha Molla was missing for last two years andthere was a criminal case in between the Partiespending and the defendant Nos. 4 and 5 upon con-structing shop and dwelling house in the said Pprop-erty let the same to the tenant and the plaintiff hascreated a forged registered suf-kabala being No. 382dated 4-2-1995 showing the sale of the suit proper-ty in the name of his son Abdul Hakim Molla.5. The defendant No. 2 the government ofBangladesh also contested the suit by filing writtenstatement admitting the settlement obtained by thedefendant No. 1 in 1.32 acres of land as mentionedin the plaint and stating, inter alia, that the defen-dant No. 1 upon violating the terms and conditionsof the deed of settlement, that he shall not sell thesettled property within 15 years from the date ofsettlement, sold the same to the plaintiff through thealleged Bainapatra as mentioned in the plaint. It hasbeen further asserted in the written statement by thegovernment that due to such illegal act of the defen-dant No. 1, the government has already resumed thesettled property and none of the parties are in pos-session of the suit property.6. At the trial, the plaintitY examined himselfas PW I who was duly cross-examined by defendantNo, | and also by defendant No. 2, One Yunus AliBarkandas was examined as PW 2. Plainti alsoexamined one Bablu Molla as PW 3. Th be olthe alleged Bainapatra Monnaf Mia was examined            as PW 4, The alleged Bainapatra was exhibitedExhibit No. 1 and the signature of the attesting wit-nesses also marked Exhibit.7. The defendant No. 1 examined one Bha-bendra Nath Das as DW 1 and the defendant No. 4Rowshan Ara examined herself as DW 2.Sarwar Hossxamined as DW 3 Md DurjanBepari was examined as DW 4, and the DW 5 wasGopal Chandra Karmaker. All of them were dulyamined by the plaintiff. The defendantexhibited the deed of gift being No. 1368 dated 4-2-1995, deed of gift being No. 3144 dated 21-12-1997,deed of gift being No, 369 dated 4-2-1995 and thesuf-kabala being No, 382 dated 4-2-1995. The rentreceipt and a copy of the plaint in Title Suit No. 34of 1998 was duly marked as Exhibit in the suit.8. The learned trial Judge upon framing pro-per issues considered the evidence on record andupon finding that the plaintiff miserably failed toprove his case and upon finding that the allegedBainapatra is a forged one, dismissed the suit by hisjudgment dated 29-10-2000,9. As against the said dismissal of the suit theplaintiff preferred Title Appeal No. 20 of 2001before the District Judge, Faridpur which was ulti-mately heard by the leaned Joint District Judge, 2ndCourt, Faridpur who allowed the appeal upon find-ing that the trial Court failed to consider the evi-dence on record in its true perspective and erro-neously dismissed the suit. The appellate Courtupon further finding that the Bainapatra being a gen-uine one was written on insufficient stamp,impounded the same and allowed the appeal,decreeing the suit, on condition that the plaintiff paythe impounded fee.10. Being aggrieved with and highly dissatis-fied by the judgment and decree passed by theappellate Court the defendant-respondent preferredthe instant revisional application and obtained theRule,11. During the pendency of the Rule the defen-dant No. 1, Naimuddin Molla, having died his otherOne®sons and daughters were substituted on 31-1-2008 inhis place in the Rule.12. Pursuant to the service of the Rule thelearned Advocate Mr Shisir Kanti Majumderappeared on behalf of the plaintiff-appellant-oppo-site party while the learned Advocate Mr JahangirAlam remains present on behalf of the learnedAdvocate Mr Enayetur Rahim, appearing on behalfof the defendant-respondent-petitioners and both theIcarned Advocates argued on their respective cases,13. The learned Advocate Mr Jahangir Alamhas assailed the impugned judgment and decreepassed by the appellate Court on various counts,specially on the ground that the appellate Courtcommitted error in the decision which occasionedfailure of justice, inasmuch as the appellate Courtdid not categorically reverse the finding of the trialCourt who held that the Bainapatra is a forged onewhich was written on 0.75 Taka stamp paper, pur-chased in the name of the defendant No. | long 16years ago which apparently proved that the same isa forged document created by the plaintiff in orderto grab the defendant's property through the processof Court. He further argued that the trial Court cor-rectly came to the finding that although the PW 2and PW 3 have asserted that the alleged Bainapatrawas executed in front of them but the circumstancessurrounding the alleged execution, the insufficientstamp paper and the receiving of alleged earnestmoney of Taka 20,000 from total consideration Taka25,000 and making a condition of finalisation of thesale after three years and also so-called handingover of possession of the suit property to the plain-tiff before the finalisation of the sale by executing .and registering a saf-kabala clearly prove that thesaid Bainapatra is a forged one and was not execut-ed by the defendant No.1. He contends that the dis-crepancy of the evidence of PWs have not been con-sidered by the appellate Court in its true perspective,which if apprised by this Court shall unveil the fal-sity embedded in it and in that case this Court willfind that the judgment passed in appeal is liable tobe interfered with by this Court.            14. On the other hand, the learned AdvocateMr Shisir Kanti Majumder, while supporting theimpugned judgment, has taken this Court throughthe entire reasons made by the appellate Court inorder to impress this Court that the appellate Courtcorrectly appraised the evidence on record andstrenuously argued that the impugned judgment is aproper judgment of reversal as contemplated underOrder XLI rule 31 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908. In accordance with the learned Advocate MrMajumder, the appellate Court correctly reversedevery finding of the trial Court on the basis of theevidence on record and also on the basis of theexhibited documents which the appellate Courtfound that the trial Court passed the judgment inslipshod manner and, as such, the appellate Courtcorrectly set aside the judgment of the trial Court.15. The learned Advocate Mr Jahangir Alam,on his next count of argument, assailed the judgmentpassed in appeal on the ground that as the defendantNo.1 categorically, in his written statement, deniedthe fact that he has not executed the allegedBainapatra by putting LTI, the onus probandi lies onthe plaintiff's shoulder to prove his case, that thedefendant No.1 executed the same, through makinga prayer before the Court for an examination of thealleged LTI of the defendant No.1 by a handwritingexpert, which although the plaintiff prayed beforethe trial Court, but did not take step to obtain thespecimen of LTI of the sick defendant No.1 throughAdvocate Commissioner and, as such, his applica-tion having been rejected by the trial Court, must betreated that the plaintiff failed in discharge his onusof proving his case. In this respect, the learnedAdvocate Mr Jahangir Alam referred to the case ofNaimuddin Sarder @ Naimuddin Sarder vs MdAbdul Kalam Biswas @ Md Abul Kalam Bashir-uddin @ Abul Kalam Azad reported in 39 DLR (AD)237 and also the case of Quazi Din Mohammad vsAl-haj Arzan Ali reported in 47 DLR 48 and also thecase of Biplob Chandra Das vs Biran Chandra Dasreported in 52 DLR 586.16. In reply to the 2nd count of argument of thedefendant-respondent-petitioner, Mr Sisir KantiMajumder argued, on behalf of the plaintiff-appel-lant-opposite party, that since the plaintiff by thePWs successfully proved the execution of theBainapatra by the defendant No.1 onus probandiwas shifted to the defendant No.1 to prove that hehas not executed the Bainapatra by putting his LT]on the same and as such a bounden duty was castupon him to pray for examination of his LTI byhandwriting expert which as he failed, the plaintiffobtained the order of the trial Court for such exami-nation by the handwriting expert but the defendantNo.1 having apprehended that such an examinationwill prove the execution of the Bainapatra as gen-uine refrained from putting his specimen LTI,despite the repeated orders of the trial Court and, assuch, the presumption under section 114(g) of theEvidence Act, 1872 is applicable in this case whichshall come in benefit to the plaintiff. In this respectthe learned Advocate relied on the case of Zahid Alivs Jamini Kanta reported in 1987 BLD (AD) 156.17. The learned Advocate Mr Jahangir Alamfinally argued that the appellate Court committederror while impounding the alleged Bainapatra with-out considering the fact that the same cannot beadmitted in evidence and marked as Exhibit so as toconsider the same as evidence, since the same wasinsufficiently stamped, as such, the same was notrequired to be considered by the appellate Court asa valid piece of evidence and therefore, theimpounding of the said stamp paper did not make ita valid piece of evidence for which the judgmentpassed in appeal decreeing the suit relying on inad-missible evidence is a palpable illegality and erro-neous on the facts and circumstances of the casewhich is liable to be set aside by this Court.18. In reply the learned Advocate Mr ShisirKanti Majumder strenuously argued that the appel-late Court correctly considered that the ExhibitNo.1, the impugned Bainapatra, has been admittedcorrectly in evidence by the trial Court as a proveddocument and accordingly, finding the same is ininsufficient stamp paper, impounded the same underthe provision of Order XIII, rule 8 of the Code ofCivil Procedure, 1908 and, as such, the appellate            Court correctly came to the finding that the judg-ment passed by the trial Court is liable to be setaside and the suit is required to be decreed. In thisrespeet, the learned Advocate Mr Shisir KantiMajumder relied on the decision of the case ofDaulat Lid vs Pubali Bank Ltd reported in 39 DLR(AD) 243 in order to substantiate his argument thatthe appellate Court correctly found that the Baina-patra having been sufficiently proved by the plain-tiff, the appeal is required to be allowed on collect-ing the impounded stamp duty from the plaintiff andas the plaintifT has already paid the impounded stampduty the judgment passed by the appellate Court isnot liable to be interfered with by this Court,19. I have heard the learned Advocates, per-used the impugned judgments, the materials onrecord, specially the Bainapatra and the evidence asadduced by the parties. I have also considered thearguments advanced at the Bar.20. At this revisional stage the defendant-respondent-petitioner has assailed the impugnedBainapatra and the impounding of the stamp duty ofit by the appellate Court and, in accordance with the‘argument of the defendant-respondent-petitioner,the impounding of the stamp duty of the impugnedBainapatra did not make it a proper document to beadmitted into evidence, although the plaintiff hasalready, in accordance with the order of the appel-late Court, paid the impounded stamp duty of theBainapatra. Contrary to such argument the plaintiffappellant-opposite-party contends that a series ofdecisions of this Court and the law itself providesthat once a document is admitted into evidence,rightly or wrongly, the same cannot be discardedater, on the ground that the same has not been prop-erly stamped.Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 categori-cally provides the circumstances under which a doc-ument cannot be admitted in evidence, which runsas follows :Stamp Act, 1899 :"Section 35—/nstruments not dulystamped inadmissible in evidence, ete—Noinstrument chargeable with duty shall be admit-ted in evidence for any purpose by any personhaving by law or consent of parties authority toreceive evidence, or shall be acted upon, regis-tered or authenticated by any such person or byany public officer, unless such instrument isduly stamped:Provided that—(a) any such instrument not being an instru-ment chargeable with a duly of ten poishaor five poisha only, or a bill of exchange orpromissory note, shall subject to all justexceptions, be admitted in evidence onpayment of the duty with which the sameis chargeable, or, in the case of an instru-ment insufficiently stamped, or theamount required to make up such duty,together with a penalty of five Taka, or,when ten times the amount of the properduty or deficient portion thereof exceedsfive Taka, or a sum equal to ten times suchduty or portion :(b) where any person from whom a stampedreceipt could have been demanded, hasgiven an unstamped receipt and suchreceipt, if stamped, would be admissible inevidence against him, then such receiptshall be admitted in evidence against himon payment of a penalty of one Taka by theperson tendering it;(c) where a contract or agreement of any kindis effected by correspondence consistingof two or more letters and any one of theletters bears the proper stamp, the contractor agreement shall be deemed to be dulystamped.(d) Nothing herein contained shall prevent theadmission of any instrument in evidence inany proceeding in a Criminal Court, otherthan a proceeding under Chapter XII orChapter XXXVI of the Code of CriminalProcedure, 1898.            (e) Nothing herein contained shall prevent theadmission of any instrument in any Courtwhen such instrument has been executedby or on behalf of the Government, orwhere it bears the certificate of theCollector as provided by section 32 or anyother provision of this Act,”21. The aforesaid provision indicates thatinsufficiently stamped document can be admittedinto evidence if the same is impugned and the prop-er stamp duty is paid in Court. This also indicatesthat failure to pay the proper stamp duty onlyattracts penalty which, being a curable lacuna, ifProperly cured by paying the impounded stampduty, the same becomes competent to be admittedinto evidence, section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899does not say to throw out a document in limine forwant of stamp duty. It further appears from section36 of the Stamp Act, 1899 that if any document,insufficiently stamped, is admitted into evidence,tightly or wrongly, the same would be immune fromchallenge later. Section 36 of the Stamp Act, 1899provides as follows;Stamp Act; 1899 :"Section: 36—Admission of instrumentwhere not to be questioned—When an instru-ment has been admitted in evidence, suchadmission shall not, except as provided in sec-tion 61, be called in question at any stage of thesame suit or proceeding on the ground that theinstrument has not been duly stamped."22. In the case of Daulat Lid vs Pubali BankLtd reported in 39 DLR (AD) 243 as relied upon byMr Majumder, a Division Bench of this Court whileconsidering the admissibility of insufficientlystamped document into evidence, considered theprovision of section 36 of the Stamp Act, 1899 andheld as under;"The provision of section 36 of the StampAct is mandatory and that once a document isadmitted in evidence it is not permissible for thetrial Court or the appellate Court or the Court ofRevision to reject it as evidence on the groundthat it has not been duly stamped,”23. In the case before us, it appears that at therelevant period the stamp duty for a Bainapatra(deed of agreement for sale of land) was fixed atTaka 1.50 but the impugned Bainapatra, dated 17-S-1994, was written on a stamp paper of denominationof Taka 0.75. Finding such insufficiency of thestamp duty of the Bainapatra the appellate Courtcame to the finding that as the Bainapatra has beenproved by the plaintiff, the same is required to beimpounded under the provision of Order XII, rule §of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and accord-ingly, the appellate Court in the impugned judgmentpassed an order for impounding the said Bainapatraand allowed the appeal subject to payment ofimpounded stamp duty by the plaintiff, which theplaintiff has already paid. It appears that this lacunain the impugned Bainapatra for insufficiency ofstamp duty has been cured by the said impoundingorder and in view of the provision of section 35 ofthe Stamp Act, 1899 this Court finds that theimpugned Bainapatra was competent to be admittedinto evidence in this proceeding. Moreover, in viewof the provision of section 36 of the Stamp Act,1899 and the decision of the case reported in 39DLR 243, this Court finds that the appellate Courtcorrectly considered that the said Bainapatra asadmissible in evidence. Therefore, this Court findssubstantial force in the argument of Mr Shisir KantiMajumder that the impugned Bainapatra has beencorrectly admitted into evidence by the trial Court aswell as appellate Court and the question of insuffi-ciency of the stamp duty has been properlyaddressed.24. But the question remains whether theappellate Court apprised the evidence on record tocome to a finding that the plaintiff could prove thegenuineness of the Bainapatra through the evidenceon record as adduced by the PWs and also throughthe cross-examination of the DWs. It appears thatthe PW 1 asserted that while the defendant No.!Naimuddin Molla was a landless person in the year1979, obtained the settlement of khas property from            the government, defendant No.2, measuring an areaof 1.32 acres comprised in three plots which he inthe year of 1994, afier expiry of 15 years, whenoffered to sell, the plaintiff accepted the offer to pur-chase the same at a consideration of Taka 25,000.The defendant No.1 in order to substantiate theirassertion that the impugned Bainapatra is a forgedone heavily hammered the point of consideration. Itappears that the trial Court found that the plaintiffadmitted that he has a piece of land adjacent to thesuit property of the same quantum which he admit-ted ted at Taka 1,00,000, The trial Court uponsuch fact disbelieved the consideration of Taka25,000 for the same quantum of land adjacent to thejand of the plaintif's ownership. But the appellateCourt on this point came to the finding that uponsuch single assertion of the PW 1 the genuinenessof the Bainapatra cannot be ascertained. The plain-tiff in his deposition asserted that in the presence ofPW 2 and PW 3 he negotiated the sale of the suitproperty and after stipulating the price when hedemanded a Bainapatra, then and there, defendantNo. | disclosed that he has got a stamp paper, earli-er purchased on 21-12-1978, upon which Bainapatramay be written. The plaintiff allowed to write theBainapatra on the same stamp paper when defendantNo. 1 executed the same by putting his LTI and atthe same time PW 2 and PW 3 also put their signa-tures in the Bainapatra as the attesting witnesses.The trial Court on such fact of execution of theBainapatra in an insufficient and old dated stampfound a reason to disbelieve the Bainapatra on theground, then the PW 1 admitted that he has notquestioned the legality and illegality of writing theBainapatra on an old dated stamp, nor he consultedany lawyer on such point. The learned Advocate MrShisir Kanti Majumder on this point submits that asthere was urgency from the part of the defendantNo, 1 to get the money immediately, upon sellingthe land, he hurriedly supplied the stamp paper keptin his custody and the plaintiff on bonafide beliefdid not suspect any impediment for writing theBainapatra on the said old dated stamp paper. Theappellate Court on this point found that there is noreason to disbelieve the assertion of the plaintiff,since it is beyond all probable suggestion that theplaintiff shall keep a stamp paper for last 16 years inthe name of the defendant No. 1 for writing aBainapatra on the same stamp paper after 16 yearsand accordingly, the learned appellate Judgebelieved that the stamp paper was genuine one uponwhich the plaintiff, through scribe, wrote theBainapatra, It further appears that the plaintiffasserted that on the date of execution of theBainapatra, he was given the possession of the suitproperty in which he was in possession till he wasdispossessed by the defendant Nos. 3-5 on and from9-8-1999 during the pendency of the suit. The trialCourt disbelieved such assertion of the plaintiff onthe ground that the PWs, on this assertion of theplaintiff, could not prove the possession of the plain-tiff in the suit property and, as such, the trial Courtdid not believe the hand over of possession of thesuit property by the defendant No. | to the plaintiff.On the other hand, the appellate Court came to thefinding that the plaintiff was in possession of the suitproperty from which the defendant Nos. 3-5 dispos-sessed him and accordingly, the appellate Courtfound the possession of the plaintiff as genuinelyobtained through the impugned Bainapatra. In thisrespect the appellate Court appraised the evidenceof DW 2 and came to the finding that the assertionof the defendant Nos. 3-5 is false and the plaintiff'sBainapatra having been sufficiently proved by theevidence on record the appeal is entitled to beallowed and the suit decreed.25. Upon scanning through the evidence onrecord, it appears that the learned appellate Judgefell into an error when apprising the evidence onrecord as to the genuneness of the Bainapatra whichappears to this Court as based upon surmises andconjecture. It appears that while considering thedate of the stamp paper, upon which the BainapatraWas written in a compact manner, the appellateCourt opined that it is unbelievable that the plaintif?would keep a stamp paper worth Taka 0.75 in orderto write a Bainapatra after 16 years. This opinion ofthe appellate Court is apparently perverse consider-ation of the evidence, inasmuch as, the appellate            Court did not consider that the alleged executants ofthe Bainapatra, the defendant No. 1 NaimuddinMollah, was an admittedly landless person, havingno reasonable business to keep a stamp paper withhim for 16 years. The opinion of the appellate Courtis nothing but a surmise which is neither supportedby any evidence on record nor by the circumstancessurrounding the case.26. It further appears that the plaintiff allegedthat he had purchased the suit property measuring1.02 acres of land at a consideration of Taka 25,000which the trial Court found that as the plaintiffadmitted that his own property, adjacent to the suitproperty, is valued at Taka 1,00,000 and, as such, theconsideration, as alleged by the plaintiff, indicatesthat the same is not a genuine one. This Court is inagreement with the finding of the trial Court anddisagrees with the finding of the appellate Court thatthe plaintiff casually said that his property, adjacentto the suit property, is valued at Taka 1,00,000. Thisvital point regarding the consideration of the suitproperty, in a suit for Specific Performance ofContract, is one of the clements upon which thegenuneness of Bainapatra may be considered, spe-cially when the defendant has categorically deniedthat he has not executed the impugned Bainapatra infavour of the plaintiff. Moreover, the appellateCourt upon appraising the evidence of DWs appar-ently perversely came to the finding regarding thehand over of possession of the suit property to theplaintiff, although PW 2 and PW 3 failed to provethat any such possession was handed over in theirpresence, save and except the statement that thedefendant No. 4 forcibly dispossessed the plaintifffrom the possession of the suit property. Therefore,on the admission of the plaintiff that the defendantNo. 3 and defendant No. 4 are in possession of thesuit property, albeit in part as alleged, the questionof handing over of possession of the suit property tothe plaintiff earlier at the time of execution of theBainapatra must have been considered by the appel-late Court as not proved. Therefore, this Court findsthat the assertion regarding handing over of posses-sion of the Baina land to the plaintiff is nothing buta falsity.27. It appears that law requires caveat emptor,meaning thereby that the purchaser must be carefulabout purchased property and the procedure throughwhich he purchased the property. The allegedBainapatra has been written on a single stamp paperworth 0.75 Taka, but at the relevant time the stampduty for Bainapatra was fixed at Taka 1.50. Theplaintiff said that the stamp paper had been suppliedby the defendant No. | and he did not enquire thelegality of writing the Bainapatra on an old datedinsufficient stamp. This indicates the forgery sur-rounding the creation of the Bainapatra, because it jsvery easy to procure an old dated stamp of anydenomination on any person's name with the collab-orative of the corrupt stamp vendors and the goy-ernment treasury employees. The circumstancessurrounding this case clearly proved that the plain-tiff after procuring a antedated stamp paper man-aged to write Bainapatra on it with the help of so-called attesting witnesses, two of whom are his ownpersons, admittedly the PW 3 is his nephew and PW2 is a friend. Therefore, this Court finds that theappellate Court considering the evidence on recordperversely, both oral and documentary, reversed thejudgment of the trial Court dismissing the suit and,as such, this Court finds sufficient strength in theargument of the learned Advocate Mr Jahangir Alamthat the impugned judgment passed in appeal is nota proper judgment of reversal. In this respect thecase of Quazi Din Mohammad vs Al-haj Arjan Alireported in 47 DLR (AD) 48 and the case of BiplobChandra Das vs Biren Chandra Das reported in 52DLR 586 are relevant, wherein their Lordships in theAppellate Division and also in this Division heldthat inadequacy of consideration sometimes shouldbe considered against the genuineness of theBainapatra and also in the case where Bainapatra is |denied with the circumstances surrounding the exe-cution of it, must be taken into consideration beforecoming to decisive decision that the same is a gen-uine one.28. The learned Advocate Mr Shisir KantiMajumder heavily hammered on the point that onusof proving the non-execution of Bainapatra by the            defendant No. 1 lies on the shoulders of defendantNo. 1 which he failed to discharge. This is a nobleargument contrary to the age-old principle that theplaintiff has to prove his own case. In a suit forSpecific Performance of Contract the execution ofBainapatra, if denied by the defendant the allegedexecutant, the onus probandi of genuine executionof the same lies upon the shoulder of the plaintiff onthe principle that the plaintiff has to prove his owncase. Therefore, this Court finds no merit in theargument of Mr Shishir Kanti Majumder. Thereferred case of Zahid Ali Mondol vs Jamjini KantaDey reported in 1987 BLD (AD) 156 being on thepoint of benefit as provided in section 141(g) of theEvidence Act, 1872 has no manner of application inthis case.29. Upon apprising through evidence on recordand the judgment of the Courts below, this Court hasgot no hesitation but to hold that the appellate Courterroncously allowed the appeal and decreed the suitwhen the plaintiff miserably failed to prove thealleged Bainapatra as genuine document throughwhich he has allegedly obtained the possession ofthe suit property and, as such, this Court finds suffi-cient merit in the Rule which is required to be madeabsolute.30. In the result, the Rule is made absolute.The judgment and decree dated 22-6-2002 passedby the learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court,Faridpur in Title Appeal No. 20 of 2001, allowingthe appeal and decrecing the suit, is hereby set asideand the judgment and decree dated 29-10-2002passed by the learned Assistant Judge in Title SuitNo. 33 of 1998, dismissing the suit, is herebyrestored and maintained.31. However, there shall be no order as tocosts.Let a copy of the judgment along with LCR besent down to the Courts below at once.Ed.HIGH COURT DIVISION(Criminal Miscellaneous Ju diction)Siddiqur Rahman afiqul Islam......PetitionerMiah JMd Abdul Hatiz J "Judgment State and anotFebruary 23rd, 2009.

Necessary facts for the purpose of disposalof this Rule is that, the complainant opposite partyNo.2 Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited filed CRCase No.138 of 2007 in the court of Chief Metro-politan Magistrate, Chittagong under section 138 ofthe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 stating interalia that the complainant opposite party allowedLetter of Credit facilities in favour of accused peti-tioner, Md Rafiqul Islam, which were expired on 22-12-2005 and 1-5-2006; that the liability of theaccused stands at Taka 70, 63, 291 including profitwith compensation and the accused became default-er borrower and that in this regard in order to repaythe money the accused issued to cheques amountingto Taka 9,00,000 bearing cheque No. Gha 0629585dated 20-2-2007 and amounting to Taka 2,00,000bearing Cheque No. Gha 629586 dated 20-2-2007 infavour of the complainant, which was drawn withthe Agrani Bank, Fishing Centre Branch EPZChittagong.3. It is further stated that complainant on 20-2-2007 placed the above mentioned cheques forencashment to the Agrani Bank but the chequeswere dishonoured with a remark “#facet “tala1 GH ARI" and that there after the complainantserved a legal notice dated 21-6-2007 upon theaccused to repay the money and the accusedreceived the legal notice on 25-6-2007. The com-plainant further stated that he took the shelter of thecourt after failing to get the money. Hence the case.4. The learned Magistrate on receipt of thepetition of complain took cognizance of the caseagainst the accused petitioner under section 138 ofthe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The accusedpetitioner surrendered before the court with prayerfor bail and he was enlarged on bail. There after thecase has been transferred to the court of the LearnedMetropolitan Sessions Judge, Chittagong who ontum transferred the case to the court of the LearnedAdditional Metropolitan Sessions Judge. theaccused petitioner appeared before the court of thelearned Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge,Chittagong who has been pleased to grant him bailvide his order dated 27-11-2007,There after the accused petitioner filed a mis-cellaneous case before this court under section 561Aof the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained aRule in which the further proceedings have beenstayed.5. Mr Shah Md Munir Sharif, the learneqAdvocate for the accused petitioner submits thatnotice under section 138(1)(b) of the NegotiableInstruments Act was issued on 1-3-2007 and thatthere is nothing in complaint petition when the saiqnotice was actually served upon the petitioner andthat the instant proceeding was initiated on 24-7.2007 afier expiry of 4 months 20 days from issuanceof the said notice which is against the provision oflaw.6. He further submits that the second noticewas served upon the petitioner on 21-6-2007 and thepetitioner received the notice on 25-6-2007; that the |petitioner will get 1(one) month's time from the >date of receipt of the notice but the complainantfiled the instant case before expiry of one month. [tis further submitted that cause of action arises onemonth after the issuance of notice under clause ofthe proviso to section 138 but complaint was filedlong after the statutory period and, as such, petitionunder section 561A of the Code of CriminalProcedure is liable to be quashed,7. The learned Advocate for the Oppositeparty No.2 complainant on the other hand submitsthat the chief Metropolitan Magistrate took cog-nizance of the offence on the basis of complain-peti-tion which had not filed in accordance with the pro-visions of the Negotiable Instruments Act; that thecase was initiated on 24-7-2007 after the expiry of 4months 20 days from issuance of first notice as theaccused petitioner verbally prayed for time and thatthough the case was filed before one day before theexpiry of one month from the date of receipt of thesecond notice, the proceedings cannot be quashedreadily when from the materials on record it appearsa prima facie case of committing offence against theaccused petitioner and as such the Rule should bedischarged.            8. In order to appreciate the submission madeby the leamed Advocates for the accused petitionerand the opposite party No.2, let us now sce whetherthe complainant opposite party No.2 has filed thecase before the leamed Magistrate strictly comply-ing with the provision of law envisaged under sec-tion 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Actand whether the proceedings under section 561A of.the Code of Criminal Procedure is liable to bequashed. Now let us see the section 138 of theNegotiable Instrument act which reads as follows :"138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficien-cy, etc. of funds in the account (1)—Where anycheque drawn by a person on an account main-tained by him with a banker for payment of anyamount of money to another person from out ofthat account is returned by the bank unpaid,either because of the amount of money standingto the credit of that account is insufficient todishonour the cheque or that it exceeds thatamount arranged to be paid from that accountby an agreement made with that bank, such per-son shall be deemed to have committed anoffence and shall, without prejudice to anyother provisions of this Act, be punished withimprisonment for a term which may extend toone year, or with fine which may extend to(thrice) the amount of the cheque, or with both;Provided that nothing contained in this sec-tion shall apply unless—(a) the cheque has been presented to thebank within a period of six monthsfrom the date on which it is drawn orwithin the period of its validity,whichever is earlier;(b) The payee or the holder in due courseof the cheque, as the case may be,makes a demand for the payment ofthe paid amount of money by giving anotice, in writing, to the drawer of thecheque, within thirty days of thereceipt of information by him fromthe bank regarding the return of thecheque as unpaid, and(c) The drawer of such cheque fails tomake the payment of the said amountof money to the payee or, as the casemay be, to the holder in due course ofthe cheque, within (thirty days) of thereceipt of the said notice.9, Ona careful analysis of section 138 of theNegotiable Instruments Act, it is seen that its mainpart creates an offence when a cheque is returned bythe bank unpaid for any of the reasons mentionedtherein, The significant fact however, is that the pro-viso lays down three conditions precedent to theapplicability of the above section and, for that mat-ter, creation of such offence and the conditions are:(i) the cheque should have been presented to thebank within’ six months of its issue or within theperiod of its validity whichever is earlier; (ii) payeeshould have made a demand for payment by regis-tered notice after the cheque is returned unpaid; and(iii) that the drawer should have failed to pay theamount within 30 days of the receipt of notice. It isonly when all the above three conditions are satis-fied that a prosecution can be launched for theoffence under section 138.10. Now let us see the provision of section 141of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which runs asfollows :“141. Cognizance of offences—Notwith-standing any thing contained in the Code ofCriminal Procedure 1898.(a) No court shall take cognizance of anyoffence punishable under section 138except upon a complaint, in writing,made by the payee or, as the case maybe, the holder in due course of thecheque;(b) Such complaint is made within onemonth of the date on which the cause ofaction arises under clause (c) of the pro-viso to section 138.(c) no court inferior to that of a court of ses:sions shall try any offence punishableunder section 138."            11. From the plain reading of the above sectionit is manifest that a competent court can take cog-nizance of a written complaint of an offence undersection 138 it is made within one month of the dateon which the cause of action arises under clause (c)of the proviso of section 138. — (emphasis supplied)12. From the above provisions, we find the fol-lowing three different propositions which have beensupported by our apex Court.(i) acheque can be presented for encashmenton any number of occasions within theperiod of its validity and its dishonour onevery occasion will give rise to a fresh‘Cause of action’ within the meaning ofclause (b) of section 141 of the NegotiableInstruments Act so as to entitle the payeeto institute prosecution under section 138on the basis of the last cause of action;(ii) A cheque can be presented for encash-ment on any number of occasions withinthe period of its validity but there can beonly one cause of action under section141(b) arising from its last dishonour and(iii) Only for the first dishonour and not sub-sequent dishonour can a prosecutionunder section 138 be instituted as per sec-tion 138(c) read with section 141(b)envisages only one cause of action inrespect of one and the same cheque.13. Now the point for determination is (i)whether the petitioner filed the case satisfying theprovisions of law and (ii) whether taking cognizanceof the offence in this case is in contravention of lawand (iii) whether the continuation of the case islegal.14. There is no denying of the fact that theaccused petitioner issued two cheques to repay themoney in favour of the opposite party No.2 IslamiBank Bangladesh Ltd. On 20-2-2007, that com-plainant placed the cheques for encashment to theAgrani Bank on 20-2-2007 within 6(six) months orwithin its validity but the cheques were dishonouredon the same day due to insufficiency of fund andthat the complainant served legal notice in writingon 21-6-2007 upon the accused petitioner within 30days the receipt of information regarding return ofcheques unpaid as per section 138(1)(b) of theNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881.15. On perusal of the above facts, it appearsthat the complainant opposite party No.2 has ful-filled two conditions this is, he presented the chequewithin the period of its validity and he has also madea demand by giving notice in writing within 30 daysof the receipt of information from the bank regard.ing the return of the cheque as unpaid.16. Now the point for determination is whetherthe complainant opposite party No.2 has filed thecomplaint as per the provision of section 138(1)(c)and section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Actand whether the accused petitioner is entitled to getany relief of the application under section 561A ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure.17. It is undenying of the fact that the notice ofdemand was issued on 1-3-2007. As per section138(1)(c) of the act, the accused petitioner will get30 days, time from the date of receipt of the noticeto make payment of the said amount and thereafterthe cause of action of the case will arise. Once hegives a notice under section 138(1)(b) of the Act, heforfeits right to issue second notice. Herein thiscase, the complainant opposite party No.2, IslamiBank Bangladesh Ltd, issued two notices, firstly on1-3-2007 and secondly on 21-6-2007. The com-plainant opposite party No.2 filed complaint petitionon 24-7-2007, the learned Magistrate took cog-nizance on 24-7-2007 against the accused petitionerunder section 138 of the Negotiable InstrumentsAct, 1881.18. Now the question is whether the filing ofthe complaint on 24-7-2007 and taking cognizanceof the complaint on 24-7-2007 is legal or not.19. On perusal of the record, it appears that thefirst notice for demand of money was issued on |-3-2007. There is nothing in the complaint when the            said notice was actually served on the petitioner.The case of the opposite party No.2 is that after get-ting the notice, the accused petitioner came to bankauthority and verbally prayed for sometime andaccordingly sometime was given. But the accusedpetitioner denied these facts. Actually there is norecord or evidence to believe such oral version ofthe opposite party No.2. The opposite party No.2has created such story in order to save the limitationin filing the complaint in due time. Since the oppo-site party No.2 admits that the accused petitionercame to the bank after getting the first notice whichclearly speaks that the first notice was duly servedon the accused petitioner.20. As per provision of section 138(1)(b) of theAct, the opposite party No.2 had to file the casewithin 30 days from the receipt of first noticeecause once the opposite party No.2 gives a noticeunder section 138(1)(b) of the Act, he foresight suchright and he cannot issue second notice. It is signif-icant to note that clause (b) of section 141 gives itarestrictive meaning is that, it refers to only one factwhich will give rise to the cause of action. Section138 and 141 clearly postulates only one cause ofaction and there is no legal scope for successivecause of action. The combined reading of section138 and 141 of the Act leave no room for doubt thatcause of action with the meaning of section 141(c)arises and can arises only once. In the instant case,such cause of action with arises within 30 days ofthe receipt of first notice in accordance with138(1)(b) of the Act. But the opposite party No.2,Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd, filed the complaint on24-7-2007 after expiry of 4 months 20 days from theissuance of said notice and therefore initiation of theimpugned proceedings on the basis of second noticeis not legal and accordingly taking cognizance of theComplaint by the Magistrate on 24-7-2007 is alsonot legal. The continuation of the proceedings istherefore, a abuse of he process of the Court.21. In this connection we like to refer the deci-Sion in the case of SM Anwar Hossain vs Md Shafiul| dlam reported in 5] DLR (AD) 218 where in thereLordships held :"Subsequent allegation will not save limi-tation for prosecution-the requirement underthe law is that the complaint against non-pay-ment of money has to be filed within one monthof the date on which the cause of action arises,The High Court Division wrongly rejected theapplication for quashing. The principle of theabove decision is quite applicable in our case. "22. Now the question arises whether theinstant proceeding is liable to be quashed or not.23. In this connection we may also profitablyrefer the decision in the case of Ali Akkas vs EnayetHossain reported in 1997 BLD (AD) 44 = 2 BLC(AD) 16 wherein their Lordships held:"the settled principle of law is that to ring acase within the purview of section 561A for thepurpose of quashing a proceeding one of fol-lowing conditions must be fulfilled:(1)Interference even at an initial stage maybe justified where the facts are so pre-posterous that even on admitted facts nocase stands against the accused;Where the institution and continuation ofthe proceeding amounts to an abuse ofthe process of the Court;(2)Where there is a legal bar against the ini-tiation or continuation of the proceeding;(3)Ina case where the allegations in the FIRor the petition of complaint, even iftaken at their face value and accepted intheir entirely, do not institute the offencealleged; and(4)The allegations against the accusedalthough constituted an offence allegedbut there is either no legal evidenceadduced in support of the case or the evi-dence adduced clearly or manifestly failsto prove the charge."(5)24, In the light of the above decision and con-sidering the facts and circumstances of the case, weare of the view that since the complainant opposite            party No.2 filed the complaint after expiry of thestatutory period of 30 days from the date of issuanceof notice under proviso of section 138(1)(b) of theNegotiable Instruments Act and as such taking cog-nizance of complaint by the Magistrate was notlegal and since taking cognizance is illegal, so thecontinuation of the proceeding will create a abuse ofthe process of the Court.25. In view of the discussion as made aboveand in the light of the facts and circumstances of thecase and law bearing to it, we are of the view that thecomplainant committed wrong in two Courts firstlyhe filed complaint after the expiry of statutory peri-od of limitation and secondly, he filed a prematurecomplaint in contravention of section 138 Sub-sec-tion (1) proviso (c) of the Negotiable Instrument Actand accordingly the Court also took cognizance incontravention of clause 141(b) of the NegotiableInstruments Act.26. Keeping these settled principles in view, itcan be said that the learned Additional MetropolitanSessions Judge most illegally and contrary to pre-vailing law and established principles laid down inthe said decision of our Appellate Division hadwrongly continued with the proceeding.27. For the foregoing reasons, we have noother alternative but to quash the proceedings. Theaccused petitioner is, therefore, entitled to get therelief as prayed for and, as such, the Rule should bemade absolute.28. In the result, the Rule is made absolute andthe proceeding of Sessions Case No.1131 of 2007arising out of Criminal Case No. 138 of 2007 undersection 128 of the Negotiable Instruments Act pend-ing in the Court of learned Additional MetropolitanSession Judge, Chittagong is hereby quashed.Communicate the order to the Court of thelearned Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge,Chittagong, forthwith.Ed,HIGH COURT DIVISION(Criminal Revisional Jurisdiction)Md Abdul Hye J. | Amanullah (Md).........00..,Md Abdus Samad J} ...........04 Accused-petitionervsState and another..........0...,feeaapsaaueeaeee Opposite Party*JudgmentJune 3rd, 2010.Code of Criminal Procedure (Vv of 1898)Sections 241A and 242Penal Code (XLV of 1960)Section 165ACriminal Law Amendment Act (XL of 1958)Section 4Court is to record the reasons for discharg-ing the accused under section 241A of the Code,but no such reasons are required to be recordedin farming charge against the accused as per pro-visions of section 242 of the Code. The SpecialJudge framed charge against the accused-peti-tioner after hearing both the parties and beingsatisfied that there was ground for framing ofcharge. No illegality in framing of charge againstthe accused-petitioner and there is no ground ofsetting aside the impugned order.Syed Haider Ali, Advocate—For the Accused-Peti-tioner.Khandker Modarresh Elahi (Tiru), Assistant Attor-ney-General—For the State-Opposite Party No.1.Md Khurshid Alam Khan, Advocate — For the ACC-Opposite Party No.2.JudgmentMd Abdus Samad J : This Rule, at the instanceof accused-petitioner Md Amanullah, was issuedcalling upon the opposite-party to show cause as towhy the impugned order of framing of charge dated6-7-2009 passed by the learned Special Judge, CourtNo.4, Dhaka, rejecting the application filed for dis-charge of the accused-petitioner under section 241 A*Criminal Revision No.1451 of 2009.            of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Special CaseNo.21 of 2009 arising out of Kafrul PS Case No.30dated 11-10-2007 under section 165A of the PenalCode should not be set aside and/or such other orfurther order or orders passed as to this Court mightseem fit and proper.2. In short, the facts relevant for disposal ofthis Rule are as follows :One Md Ali Ahmed Masud (PPM), Sub-Inspector of Police of Kafrul Police Station, DMPDhaka, being informant, lodged an ejahar on 11-10-2007 with the Kafrul Police Station, DMP Dhaka,alleging, inter alia, that on the same date at about 20-00 hours he was recording the statements of accusedMd Amanullah and co-accused Swapon in hisOffice in connection with a Memo No.D/3960/DC(Mirpur Division) Dated 1-1-2007 when accusedMd Amanullah offered him Taka 3,800 as bribe inorder to act in their favour. The informant arrestedthe accused-petitioner and seized the money bypreparing seizure list in presence of the witnesses,but co-accused Swapon fled away.3. After investigation the Anti-CorruptionCommission submitted a report against 2 (two)accused persons including the accused-petitionerunder Rule 10 of the Anti-Corruption Rules, 2007with a recommendation to stand their trial for theoffence punishable under section 165A/332 of thePenal Code.4. The accused persons were put on trialbefore the learned Special Judge, Court No.4,Dhaka. The accused-petitioner moved an applica-tion under section 241A of the Code of CriminalProcedure for discharge. The learned Special Judge,Court No.4, Dhaka, rejected the prayer for dischargeand framed charge against the accused-petitionerand another on 6-7-2009 and being aggrieved byand dissatisfied with the impugned order of framingof charge the accused-petitioner has filed thisRevisional Application under section 439 of theCode of Criminal Procedure for setting aside the‘mpugned order and obtained the instant Rule.5. Heard the learned Advocate Mr SyedHaider Ali for the accused-petitioner, the learnedAssistant Attorney-General Mr Khandker Modar-resh Elahi (Tiru) for the State-Opposite Party No.1and Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan for the Anti-Corruption Commission-Opposite Party No.2.6. Mr Syed Haider Ali, the learned Advocatefor the accused-petitioner submits that the accused-petitioner is innocent and that’he has been falselyimplicated in this case and that the first informationteport did not disclose any offence of section 165Aof the Penal Code and that no inquiry was held asper provisions of Anti-Corruption CommissionRules and that the investigation of the case was notheld as per provisions of the Anti-Corruption Com-mission Act, 2004 and Anti-Corruption CommissionRules, 2007 and in the circumstances, the impugnedorder of framing of charge dated 6-7-2009 is liableto be set aside.7. Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan, the learnedAdvocate appearing for the Anti-CorruptionCommission-Opposite Party No.2 opposes the Rulealleging, inter alia, that the first information reporthas disclosed the offence punishable under section165A/332 against the accused-petitioner and the co-accused and that the Anti-Corruption Commissionhas investigated into the case and submitted charge-sheet having found prima facie case agianst theaccused-petitioner and the co-accused and consider-ing the materials on record and having found suffi-cient ground, the learned Special Judge has framedcharge against the accused-petitioner and the co-accused and that there is no illegality in framingcharge and in the circumstances, the Rule is liable tobe discharged.8. Mr Khandker Modarresh Elahi (Tiru), thelearned Assistant Attorney-General appearing forthe State-Opposite Party No.1 has endorsed the sub-missions made by the learned Advocate Mr MdKhurshid Alam Khan for the Anti-CorruptionCommission-Opposite Party No.2.9. Perused the Revisional Application filedunder section 439 of the Code of Criminal Proce-            dure, the Annexure annexed therewith, the impug-ned order of framing of charge and the case record.10. In the instant case the only point to bedecided in whether the impugned order of framingof charge against the accused petitioner is liable tobe set aside.11. Ordinarily, criminal proceeding institutedagainst an accused person must be tried under theprovisions of law and the said proceeding should notbe generally interfered with at an interlocutory stage.12. The contention of the accused-petitioner isthat the First Information Report did not discloseany offence punishable under section 165A of thePenal Code and that the charge was framed withouthaving found any ground and materials on recordand that a Sub-Inspector of the Police recorded thestatements of some witnesses under section 161 ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure which is violationof the mandatory provision of section 20 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act and that no inquiryheld in the instant case which is violation of themandatory provisions of Rule 6 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Rules and in the circum-stances, the impugned order of framing of chargedated 6-7-2009, rejecting the prayer for dischargeunder section 241A of the Code of CriminalProcedure is liable to be set aside.13. In order to appreciate the said point raisedby the accused-petitioner reference may be made tothe relevant provisions of law.14. Section 241A of the Code of CriminalProcedure relates to discharge of accused personwhich reads as under :"241A—When accused shall be dis-charged. When the accused appears or isbrought before the Magistrate, and if theMagistrate, upon consideration of the record ofthe case and the documents submitted therewithand making such examination, if any, of theaccused as the Magistrate thinks necessary andafter giving the prosecution and the accused anOpportunity of being heard, considers thecharge to be groundless, he shall discharge theaccused and record his reasons for so doing.”15. Section. 242 of the Code of CriminalProcedure relates to framing of charge against theaccused which reads as under :"242. Charge to be framed—If, after suchconsideration and hearing as aforesaid, theMagistrate is of opinion that there is ground forpresuming that the accused has committed anoffence, the Magistrate shall frame a formalcharge relating to the offence of which he isaccused and he shall be asked whether headmits that he has committed the offence withwhich he is charged."16. On perusal of the impugned order dated 6-7-2009 it appears that the learned Special Judgeobserved all the legal formalities as stated in theaforesaid section 241A and 242 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure in rejecting the application fordischarge and framing of charge against theaccused-petitioner.17. The contention of the learned Advocate forthe accused-petitioner is that a Sub-Inspector ofPolice of Kafrul Police Station investigated into thecase in part and recorded the statements of somewitnesses under section 161 of the Code of CriminalProcedure by violating the mandatory provisions ofSection 20 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act,2004 and, as such, the proceeding is illegal. Onperusal of Annexure C series it appears that MdMazibar Rahman, Sub-Inspector of Police of KafrulPolice Station, DMP Dhaka, recorded the statementsof witnesses Md Sanwar Hossain, Md Alauddin-al-Masum, Md Mohin and Shahidullah under section161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But theaccused-petitioner did not challenge the proceedingof the case. In the instance case, the accused-peti-tioner has challenged the legality of framing ofcharge against him.18. Court is to record the reasons for discharg-ing the accused under section 241A of the Code, butno such reasons are required to be recorded in farm-ing charge against the accused as per provisions of            section 242 of the Code, The learned Special Judgeframed charge against the accused-petitioner afterhearing both the parties and being satisfied thatthere was ground for framing of charge. Therefore,we find no illegality in framing of charge against theaccused-petitioner and there is no ground of settingaside the impugned order.19. In view of the facts and circumstances ofthe case as Stated above, we are inclined to hold thatthere is no substance in the Rule and, as such, it isjiable to be discharged.20. In the result, the Rule is discharged.21. The order of stay passed at the time of issu-ing of the Rule is vacated.Let a copy of this judgment and order be sent tothe Court concerned at once of information.Ed.HIGH COURT DIVISION(Criminal Miscellaneous Jurisdiction)Khondker Musa | Solaiman (Md meKhaled J -» PetitionerMd Azizul Haque J vsJudgment State and another..... oyApril 8th, 2010. |... ..Opposite Parties*Negotiable Instruments Act (XxvVI of 1881)Sections 138 and 141Since the cheques issued by the petitionerwere dishonoured for insufficient fund and hefailed to pay the amount of the dishonouredcheques in time, offence under section 138 of theAct has been disclosed agianst him.

By the Rule issuing order dated 9-3-2008,all further proceedings of the above mentioned CRcase were stayed.3. The relevant facts for disposal of the Ruleare that the opposite party No.2 Senoara Begum ascomplainant filed the petition of complaint of theabove CR case in the Court of Chief MetropolitanMagistrate, Chittagong on 30-4-2007 stating, interalia, that on 8-10-2006 the petitioner-accused MdSolaiman took Taka 12,00,000 from her for his busi-ness purpose on the condition that he would returnthe money within a month. After expiry of that time,the complainant demanded the said money and thepetitioner issued two cheques, both dated 8-3-2007.one for Taka 2,00,000 and another for Taka10,00,000 in favour of the complainant, who on 29-3-2007 presented both the cheques for encashmentin the concerned bank, but the same were dishon-oured on the same day for insufficient fund. Hethereafter sent a legal notice on 12-4-2007 to thepetitioner which was returned on 26-4-2007. Thepetitioner did not pay the dishonoured chequeamount to the complainant in time and thereby com            mitted the offence under section 138 of the Act. Thelearned Magistrate took cognizance of offenceunder section 138 of the Act and the petitioner sur-rendered in the Court of Magistrate and he wasenlarged on bail, Thereatter, he has come to thisCourt and filed this application under section 561Aof the Code of Criminal Procedure challenging theproceedings of the CR case and obtained the Ruleand order of stay.4. Mr JBM Hasan, learned Advocate appear-ing on behalf of the petitioner attacks the proceedingof the CR case on two grounds. Firstly, he submitsthat there is no disclosure of fact in the petition ofcomplaint that the legal notice was served upon thepetitioner and as such, cause of action has not aris-en and the proceeding of the CR case was initiatedillegally which is liable to be quashed, He secondlysubmits that the legal notice was issued on 12-4-2007 and the case was filed on 30-4-2007 by notgiving thirty days time to the petitioner for paymentof the amount of the dishonoured cheques and assuch, the case was filed before cause of action hasarisen. Thus, he submits that the proceeding of theCR case has been initiated in violation of mandato-ry time limits prescribed under sections 138 and 141of the Act and the continuation of the proceedingwould be a sheer abuse of the process of Courtwhich must be prevented by quashing the proceed-ing of the case. Thus, he submits that the Rule isliable to be made absolute.5. On the other hand, Mr AKM Foez, learnedAdvocate appearing for the opposite party No.2 sub-mits that whether or not the legal notice was servedupon the petitioner and non-disclosure of the date ofthe notice in the complaint petition are questions offact to be ascertained at the time of trial. In supportof his submission he has referred to the case deci-sion reported in 60 DLR (AD) 195. As regards thedefect of pre-maturity of cause of action, the learnedAdvocate submits that though the case was filedbefore expiry of the time limit without affording thepetitioner an opportunity to pay the amount of thedishonoured cheques, but the defect of pre-maturityof cause of action has been cured during pendencyof the instant CR case. In support of his contention,he has relied on the decision reported in 53 DLR403. He further submits that the case has been filedin compliance with the legal requirements undersections 138 and 141 of the Act and, as such, thereis no reason to quash the proceeding of the CR Case,Thus, he concludes his argument by submitting thatthe Rule is liable to be discharged.6. We have heard the submissions of both thesides and perused the application under section561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure along withthe petition of complaint.7. Their Lordships of our Appellate Division,in the case of Nizam Uddin Mahmood vs AbdulHamid reported in 60 DLR (AD) 195, have held thatsince the date of receipt of legal notice is a questionof fact to be ascertained at the time of trial non-dis-closure of such fact in the complaint petition cannotrender the proceeding liable to be quashed to thegreat prejudice of the complainant who is entitled toprove his case on evidence. In view of this decision,we hold that though the date of service of the legalnotice upon the petitioner has not been mentioned inthe petition of complaint, non-disclosure of the sameis not a ground for quashment of the proceeding asit is a question of fact to be ascertained at the timeof trial. Therefore, the first ground raised by MrHasan does not stand.8. In the case of Sattya Narayan Podder vsState reported in 53 DLR 403 their Lordships of aDivision Bench of this Court have held that if thecause of action is matured during pendency of theproceeding, the defect of pre-maturity of cause ofaction could be cured and observed as follows :"Though the case was filed before expiryof 15 days time, the accused had the opportuni-ty to make the payment within 15 days. Hadsuch payment been made within 15 days evenafter filing of the complaint, in that case, theproceeding could be quashed. As he failed tomake the payment, if now we hold that the casecannot be maintained, the complainant cannotfile a fresh case because no Court will be able
