Sections 120A/34



There is no substantial difference between

conspiracy as defined in section 120A and acting

on a-common intention in section 34. In the for-

mer the gist for the offence is bare agreement and

association to break law even though illegal act

does not follow while the gist of an offence under

section 34 is the commission of a criminal act in

furtherance of a common intention of all the

offenders which means that there should be a

unity of criminal behaviour resulting in

something for which an individual will be

punishable if it is done by himself alone. (Per Md

Section 374



Delay in disposal—The appellants never

made any endeavour to dispose of the appeals

either in the High Court Division or in the

Appellate Division. It was the State that

frequently prayed for fixation of the death

Army Act (XXXIX of 1952)




Sections 378 & 429

Hearing of the case by a Third Judge—



The language used in sections 378 and 429 of the

Code is almost identical. It is said that in hearing

a reference or an appeal if the Judges are equally

divided in opinion thereon, the case with their

opinions shall be laid before a third Judge for

hearing, and the third Judge after hearing ‘as he

thinks fit? would deliver his opinion, and the

judgment and order would follow such opinion.

The expressions “as he thinks fit” used in both

the sections are significant. It is the third Judge

to decide on what points or in respect of whom he






shall hear arguments, This postulates that the

third Judge is completely free in resolving the

difference as he thinks fit. If he does not think to

near the arguments in respect of any accused of

whom the Judges are not divided in their

opinions, he may decline to do so. The use of the

words “equally divided” in both the sections

means the Judges differ in their opinions, in

respect of complicity of an accused or on the

charge framed against him or them or on any

particular point it can be inferred that they are

equally divided but in a case where the Judges

concur each other in respect of a particular

accused and in respect of the offence charged, it

can not be said that Judges are equally divided in

respect of the accused charged with.



One view is that the Third Judge is required to

examine the whole case independently and that he is not

bound by the two opinions of the two Judges comprising

the Division Bench even if there is no difference in respect

of any one of the accused persons. The other view is that

it is the discretion of the Third Judge to decide on what

points he shall hear the arguments, if any, and he is

completely free in resolving the difference. (Per SK Sinha J)

Section 154



FIR—Delay—Mere delay in lodging a case

is not a ground for disbelieving a prosecution

case, for there are various circumstances in

which lodging any case as to the commission of

offence may be delayed. (Per SK Sinha J) ...(560)



Army Act (XXXIX of 1952)

Section 31(a)(b)(c) and (d)



Clause (a) of section 31 of the Army Act rela-

tes to the substantive offence of mutiny and in-

subordination, while other three sub-clauses (b),

(c) and (d) relate to the abetment of the offence of

mutiny. In order to bring an offence of mutiny

within the ambit of the Act, there must be



MaJor BazLut Hupa vs STATE 3



evidence of overthrowing or resisting lawful

authority of the armed forces or disobeying the

authority in such circumstances as to make the

disobedience subversive of discipline or to

impede the performance of any duty or service in

the armed forces of Bangladesh. There is nothing

on record to show that the appellants and other

accused have collectively insubordinated or

defied or disregarded the authority in the armed

forces or refused to obey authority in order to

bring their act within the ambit of mutiny or

abetment for mutiny. (Per SK Sinha J).




Penal Code (XLV of 1860)

Section 120B



A conspiracy is a matter of inference

deduced from certain criminal acts of the parties

accused done in pursuance of apparent criminal

purpose common between them. A criminal cons-

piracy consists not merely intention of two or

more, but in the agreement of two or more to do

an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful

means. When two agree to carry it into effect the

very plot of the act itself, and the act of each of

the parties capable of being enforced, if lawful,

possible if for a criminal object or for the use of



criminal means. (Per SK Sinha J). wwe ef 594)



Evidence Act (1 of 1872)

Section 10



Fixing the period of conspiracy is important

as the provisions of section 10 of the Act would

apply only during the existence of the conspiracy.

(Per SK Sinha J).



Penal Code (XLV of 1860)

Sections 34/120A

Evidence Act (1 of 1872)

Section 10



Common Intention—When a criminal cons-

piracy for committing murder has been estab-

lished there is no need to award a conviction in

the aid of section 34 for, in an offence of criminal



            
conspiracy anything said, done or written in

reference to their common intention after the

intention was entertained is relevant against all

the accused, When specific acts done by each of

the accused have been established showing their

common intention they are admissible against

each and every other accused. Though an act or

action of one accused cannot be used as evidence

against other accused but an exception has been

carved out in section 10 of the Evidence Act in

case of criminal conspiracy, If there is reasonable

ground to believe that two or more persons have

conspired together in the light of the language

used in 120A of the Penal Code, the evidence of

acts done by one of the accused can be used



against the other.



In pursuance of the criminal conspiracy if the cons-

pirators commit several offences, then all of them will be

liable for the offences even if some of them had not

actively participated in the commission of the offences. It

is Not required to prove that each and every person who is

2 party to the conspiracy must do some overt-act towards

the fulfilment of the object of conspiracy, the essential

ingredient being an agreement between the conspirators to

commit the crime since from its very nature a conspiracy

is hatched in secrecy, direct evidence of a criminal conspi-

racy 10 commit a crime is not available otherwise the

whole purpose may frustrate—in most cases only the cir-

cumstantial evidence which is available from which an

inference giving rise to the commission of an offence of

conspiracy may be legitimately drawn. (Per SK Sinha J).

Penal Code (XLV of 1860)



Section 120 B



Conspiracy—In order to constitute the

offence of conspiracy, there must first be a com-

bining together of two or more persons in the

conspiracy; secondly, an act or illegal omission

must take place in pursuance of that conspiracy

in order to the doing of that thing. It is not

necessary that the abettor should concert the



Masor Baziun Hupa vs STATE




offence with the person who commits it. It is Suf.



ficient if he engages in the conspiracy in

pursuance of which the offence is committeg,

Therefore, 1 find that each conspirator plays his

separate part in one integrated and united effory

to achieve the common purpose. (Per SK Sinha J)



Words and Phrases



Due process of law—The phrase ‘due process of



law’ is synonymous with ‘law of the land’ as useq



in the famous twenty-ninth chapter of ‘Magna



Charta’ which declared that “no freeman shall be



taken, or imprisoned, or dissiezed, or outlawed,

or banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will the

king pass upon him or commit him to prison,

unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of

the land.” This principle has been adopted in the

Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Amer-

ican Constitution. Both these amendments prohi-

bit deprivation of life, liberty or property ‘with-

out due process of law’. The essence of the con-

cept is fairness and avoidance of arbitrariness.



(Per SK Sinha J)



Commutation of sentence—Delay—There

are uniform decisions of our Superior Courts

that mere delay is not a legal ground for the com-

mutation of a sentence of death.(Per SK Sinha J).



Code of Criminal Procedure (v of 1898)



Section 376



Commutation of death sentence—There is no

merit in the contention that uncontrolled and

unguided discretion of the Judges to impose capi-

tal punishment or imprisonment for life is hit by

Article 14 of the Constitution. If the Law has

given to the Judge a wide discretion in the matter

of sentence to be exercised by him after balancing

all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances

of the crime it will be impossible to say that there






would be at all any discrimination since facts and

circumstances of one case can hardly be the same

as the facts and circumstances of another.



What are the mitigating circumstances in the exercise

of court ‘s discretion have been explained thus: (a) that the

offence was committed under the influence of extreme



mental or emotional disturbance; (b) the age of the

accused .if the accused is young or old, he shall not be

sentenced to death; (c) the probability that the accused

would not commit criminal acts of violence as would

constitute Or continuing threat to society; (d) in the facts

and circumstances of the case the accused believed that he

was morally justified in committing the offence; (e)the

accused acted under duress or domination of another

rson , and (f) the condition of the accused showed that



he was mentally defective and that the said defect

impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his

conduct. In Jagmohan the following circumstances are

considered in mitigation of punishment which should be

inflicted such as (i) absence of bad intention; (ii)

provocation, (iii) self-preservation; (iv) preservation of

some near friends; (v) transgression of the limit of self-

defence; (vi) submission to the menaces; (vii) submission

to authority; (viii) drunkenness; (ix) childhood. (Per SK

Sinha J). ................(790-792)



Section 376

According to our provision the Court has

been left with the discretion on the facts of the

given case whether or not a sentence of death

should be awarded, and in case of awarding a

sentence of death the Court is required to assign

reason. The Court is of course keeping in mind

while awarding the extreme sentence whether

there is mitigating circumstances to exercise such

discretion. The mitigating circumstances in the

exercise of Courts discretion as analysed in

Jogmohan’s case (AIR 1971 SC 500) are

undoubtedly relevant circumstance and might be



given weight in the determination of sentence.

(Per SK Sinha J).



MAJor BAzZLuL Hupa vs STATE



Section 376

Although there is no evidence against all the

accused persons of directly participating in the

carnage but it should be borne in mind that for

the killing of the sitting President, all the accused

persons with a view to attainment of the object

played different roles. Without jointly operating

in concert the criminal object could not have

been executed. It was not possible to bring about

the result of the criminal object without support

of all. In view of the matter, all the conspirators

who actually participated and acted the crime do

not deserve any leniency in the matter of

sentence. (Per SK Sinha J)



Army Act (XXXIX of 1952)

Section 8(2)



Plea of ‘mutiny’—Since the prosecution wit-

nesses did not say anything in support of the plea

of mutiny, the defence ought to have made out a

case at least by way of suggestion to the witnesses

that the army officers involved in the mutiny

submitted their charter of demands to the

authority in the armed forces and that as their



.demands were not redressed, they revolted.



Secondly, if there was rebellion as claimed the



rebellious force would have attacked their com-



manding officer, and if the commanding officer

was involved, they would have attacked the Chief

of army staff but they did not attack them, rather

killed the President which proved that it was not

a mutiny. (Per SK Sinha J)



Rule of Law—The concept of rule of law is

recognised all over the world, and our founding

fathers of the Constitution also adopted that

principle, but we failed to apply the same in the



case of the killing of our Father of the Nation.

Short Order



For reasons to be recorded later on in detail, we

hereby make the following orders:



The appellants Major Md Bazlul Huda, Lieute-

nant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman, Lieutenant

Colonel] Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Lieutenant

Colonel Mohiuddin (Artillery) and Major AKM

Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) filed 5 (five) leave

etitions against the judgment and order dated 30th

April, 2001 passed by the High Court Division in

Death Reference No.30 of 1998 and Criminal

Appeal Nos. 30 of 1998, 2604 of 1998, 2613 of

1998 and 2616 of 1998 and also the order dated 14th

December, 2000 of the first and second learned

Judges of the Division Bench of the High Court

Division in the above matters.



Leave was granted to consider the following points:



(a) Because the learned Judges of the Division

Bench have delivered and signed two

Separate dissenting opinions, the Third

leamed Judge has thus committed a funda-

mental error of law in not considering the

reference in its entirety i.e., in respect of all

the convicts and considering the cases of

six convicts only,



(b) Because there is inordinate delay of 21

years in lodging the FIR.; this unreasonable

delay speaks of ill intention and design on

the part of the prosecution to falsely impli-

cate the appellants by introducing a

concocted story—the High Court Division,

in the premises, erred in law in maintaining

_ the capital sentence without properly consi-

dering this aspect of the matter,





(c) Because the evidence on record disclose .

case of mutiny leading to the murder Of the

then President and his family members and

thus the said killing not being a case of

murder simpliciter, the trial of the appel.

lants by a normal criminal Court has

Vitiated the trial.



(d) Because the evidence on record do not

disclose a case of a criminal conspiracy to

commit murder but disclose a case of cons-

piracy to commit mutiny to change the then

Mujib Government, hence the conviction

and sentence are illegal.



(e) Because the prosecution having failed to

prove the charge under sections 302/34 of

‘the Penal Code against the appellants on

proper evaluation and sifting of evidence

on record, there has been a serious

miscarriage of justice.





Our opinion on the above points is as under :



(a) Sections 378 and 429 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure contemplate that it is

for the Third learned Judge to decide on

what points he shall hear arguments, if

any, and, that postulates that he is

completely free in resolving the

difference as he thinks fit, and therefore,

the Third learned Judge was competent

to decide the case of six convicts of

whom the learned Judges were equally

divided in their opinion and thus the

Third learned Judge was in agreement

with the decision of the learned Judges

of the Division Bench in respect of

9(nine) convicts of whom there was no

difference of opinion.



(b) The learned Sessions Judge as well as

the learned Judges of the High Court

Division have believed the explanation

given by the prosecution regarding the

delay in lodging the First Information

Report on assessment of the evidence on

record; this finding being a concurrent

finding of fact, in our view, does not call

for any interference.







            
















(c) An offence of murder has been included

in section 59(2) of the Army Act, 1952

triable under the Army Act subject to the

condition that if the offender commits

the said offence while in ‘active service’,

but as the appellants were not in ‘active

service’ within the meaning of section

8(1) of the Army Act, their trial by an

ordinary criminal Court is not barred by

the provisions of the Anny Act, and

secondly, even if it is assumed that it is a

‘civil offence’ within the meaning of

section §(2) of the Army Act, there is no

legal bar for trial of such offence in view

of section 94 of the said Act.



(d) There is no legal evidence on record to

come to the conclusion that the murder

of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rah-

man and other members of his family

including the three security personnel

was committed as a consequence of

mutiny, we are of the view that it is not a

case of criminal conspiracy to commit

mutiny, rather it is a criminal conspiracy

to commit the murder of Bangabandhu

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and other

members of his family.



(e)The learned Judges of the High Court

Division having believed that the

prosecution has been able to prove

beyond reasonable doubt the charge of

murder against the appellants and other

convicts by adducing reliable evidence,

and the appellants having failed to make

out a case that the High Court Division

has caused a grave substantial injustice

or a miscarriage of justice in accepting

the death reference so far as it relates to

the appellants without proper evaluation

and sifting of evidence, we find no

cogent ground to interfere with the

impugned judgment and order of the

High Court Division.



(f) The appellants having failed to make out

a case of extenuating circumstance to

commute their sentence of death, we are

not inclined to interfere with the sen-



Masor BAZLUL Hupa vs STATE (Md Teed felon J) 9



tence of death awarded to the appellants

by the learned Sessions Judge and

maintained by the High Court Division.



In the premises, Criminal Appeal Nos. 55-59 of

2007 with Jail Appeal No. 2 of 2007 with Criminal

Miscellaneous Petition No.8 of 2001 with Criminal

Review Petition No.3 of 2000 are hereby dismissed.



The order of stay passed by this Court is hereby

vacated.



This short order shall form part of the

judgment.



Judgment



Md Tafazzul Islam J : The above appeals. by

leave, have been preferred by the appellants (1)

2. The prosecution case, as stated by the

informant, PW 1, in his deposition is that he was the

Personal Assistant of the then President of Bangla-

desh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, hereinafter referred

to as the President, and was on duty from 8-00 PM

on 14th August, 1975 at the residence of the Presi-

dent at Road No.32, Dhanmondi. He spent his night

there. At about 4-30/5-00 AM, in the early hours of

15th, he was awakened by one Abdul Matin,

telephone mechanic, who informed him that the

President is on the telephone line and after he took

the receiver the President told him to get in touch

with the police control room immediately as some

armed men attacked the house of Shemiabat, his



            


brother-in-law while he was trying to connect the

dressed army personnel entered the house a

appellant Bazlul Huda shot at Sheikh Kamal who

then fell down and the informant then told the

brush fired at Sheikh Kamal and he died; the bullets

son of the President were also brought down and

Sheikh Russell, who was with the informant, wanted

personnel snatched Sheikh Russell from the

informant and took him upstairs on the pretext of

taking him to his mother; thereafter the informant

President, Begum Mujib, Sheikh Kamal, Sheik}

Sheikh Naser and one police officer of the Speciaj

Branch, were brutally murdered in the above house.

The informant saw Faruque Rahman, Major Dalim,



ul Huda in the house of the



Major Nur and Bazlul

President at the time of occurrence and also after the

occurrence. The informant tried to lodge an inform.



mation with the then Lalbagh Police Station imme-



diately after the incident but the same was not



accepted by the police. Then out of fear for his own



life he did not lodge any F IR until now. At long last,



7-10-1996, be lodged the FIR with the Dhanmondi



Police Station in respect of the occurrence which

happened on 15th August, 1975. The police then

took up the investigation, visited the place of

occurrence, prepared sketch map with index thereof,

seized alamats, examined the witnesses and

recorded their statements under section 16] of the

Code of Criminal Procedure, produced some of the

apprehended accuseds who asked for producing

them before the competent Magistrate for recording

their confessional statement under section 164 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure and finally submitted

charge sheet against the 20 accuseds including the

present appellants under sections 302/120B/324/

307/201/380/149/34/109 of the Penal Code.



3. Among the 19 accused persons who

faced trial, 14 were absconding. The learned Judges

of the High Court Division found that the warrants

of their arrests were duly issued and when they

could not be apprehended by the police in spite of

their efforts, their properties both movable and

immovable were attached in accordance with the

provisions of the Code and thus the requirements of

sections 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Proce-

dure were satisfied and since the said accuseds

remained fugitives from law, necessary notices were

duly published in the newspaper, as required under

section 339B of the Code. Records also show that all

possible and practicable steps were taken to bring

the fugitives before the Court.



4. The learned Sessions Judge by his Order

No. 15 dated 7-4-1997 framed the following charges

against the accused persons.



            
First charge: The accused persons in collusion

with Late Khondker Mushtaque Ahmed, Late Mah-

bubul Huq Chashi, Resalder Syed Sarowar Hossain

and Captain M Mostafa Hossain, in order to satisfy

ant personal grievance to fulfil joint interest, to

ea personal aggrandisement and ambition with

ae motive, they met and conspired/together on

Paeet dates since March, 1975, at different

is ces, namely, at the residence of Lieutenant Colo-

“| Khondker Abdur Rashid at his residence at the

phaka Cantonment, BARD at Comilla, Shalna at

Gazipur the village residence of Khondker Moshtaq

ahmed at Daspara within PS and Daudkandi and at

pis residence at 54, Aga Mosi Lane, at Ramna Park,

at the residence of Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shah-

riat Rashid Khan at the Cantonment and in other

places in order to murder Bangabandhu Sheikh

Mujibur Rahman, the then President of Bangladesh,

hig relations and his family members. In order to

achieve their such objective, they assembled at

palur ghat within Cantonment Police Station on the

night following 14th August, 1975 and in fulfilment

of such conspiracy, the accused persons killed 1]

ersons on the morning of 15th August including the

then President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his

family members. As such, they committed an

offence under section 120B of the Penal Code.



Second Charge: In pursuance of the said

premeditore conspiracy and in furtherance of their

common intention, (to carry out the object of the

said criminal conspiracy) the accused persons men-

tioned in the first charge in collusion with late

Khondker Mushtaque Ahmed, late Mahbubul Alam

Chashi, Resalder Syed Sarwar Hossain and Captain

M Moshtaq Ahmed in order to vindicate their own

personal vendetta and joint interest and ambitions in

fulfilment of their conspiratorial scheme, armed

with deadly weapons, such as, tanks, cannons,

machineguns, stunguns, rifles attacked (the resi-

dence of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the

then President of Bangladesh at 677, Dhanmondi

Residential Area, Road No. 32 and murdered Ban-

gabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his wife Begum

Fazilat-un-nessa, sons Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal,

Sheikh Russell. daughters-in-law, Sultana Kamal,

Rozy Jamal and brother Sheikh Naser. Besides, they

also killed Siddiqur Rahman, ASI Police. Shamsul

Haque. Sepoy of the army and Colonel Jamil,



Military Secretary to the President and thereby com-

mitted an offence punishable under sections 302/34

of the Penal Code.



5. The learned trial Court Judge also



framed another charge under section 201 of the



Penal Code for wilfully causing disappearance of

the evidence.



6. Appellants Farook Rahman, Sultan Shah-

riar and Mohiuddin (Artillery), who were present in

the trial Court pleaded not guilty to the charges and

prayed to be tried. They were defended by the

learned Advocates of their own choice while the rest

14 absconding accused persons were defended by

the learned Advocates appointed by the State.



7. Prosecution examined 61 witnesses out

of whom some were tendered by the prosecution

and not cross-examined by the defence. The defence

did not adduce any evidence. After close of the

prosecution witnesses the three appellants on dock

were examined under section 342 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure to which they repeated their

innocence. The defence case as could be gathered

from the trend of cross-examination is total denial

and that the appellants are innocent and the

occurrence did not take place in the manner as

alleged, inasmuch as the occurrence is the result of

successful mutiny by some Army personnel.



8. The trial Court, thereafter, in conside-

ration of the evidence on record as well as facts and

circumstances of the case by judgment and order

dated 8-11-1998, acquitted four of the accused per-

sons, namely, |. Taheruddin Thakur, 2. Hon. Captain

A Wahab Joarder, 3. Dafader Marfat Ali Shah

(absconding), 4. Ld Md Abul Hashem Mridha

(absconding), and convicted the rest 15 (fifteen)

accused persons under sections 302/34 of the Penal

Code and also under section 120B of the Penal Code

and all 15 convicts including the appellants were

sentenced to death under sections 302/34 of the

Penal Code and no separate sentence under section

120B of the Penal Code was imposed upon them.

The aforesaid 15 accuseds including the appellants

were not found guilty under section 201 of the Penal

Code and were acquitted on that charge.



9. Being aggrieved by the impugned order

of conviction and sentence, appellant Faruque



            
Rahman preferred Criminal Appeal No. 2616 of

1998, appellant Sultan Shahriar preferred Criminal

Appeal No. 2604 of 1998 and the appellant Mohi-

uddin (Artillery) preferred Criminal Appeal No.

1617 of 1998. Appellant Bazlul Huda, who

althrough remained absconding during the whole

period of trial, was brought back from Bangkok to

Dhaka on the date of the pronouncement of judg-

ment of the trial Court i.c, 8-11-1998, in pursuance

of an extradition proceedings against him in

Bangkok and he then filed a regular appeal against

his conviction and sentence being Criminal Appeal

No. 2613 of 1998 before the High Court Division.



10. | Then the Death Reference and all above

4 (four) Appeals were heard together by a bench of

the High Court Division consisting of two Judges,

out of whom Md Ruhul Amin J the presiding Judge

found the present appellants along with 4 others

guilty for the offence charged and maintained the

conviction and sentence under sections 302/34 and

120B of the Penal Code passed by the trial Court in

Sessions Case No.319 of 1997 and accepted the

Death Reference so far it related to four of the

present appellants and 4 others with a modification

of the mode of execution of sentence of death and

thereby accepted the Death Reference in part and

dismissed the conviction and sentence so far it

related to 5 accuseds including appellant Mohiuddin

(Artillery) under sections 302/34 and 120B of the

Penal Code and accordingly, the Death Reference so

far it relates to them was not accepted.



11. Mr Khairul Hug J the other companion

Judge of the Bench however found all the 15

accuseds including the appellants guilty for the

offence charged and thereby affirmed the judgment

and sentence so passed by the trial Court and

accepted the Death Reference.



12. Since the judgment in the Death Refer-

ence No, 30 of 1998 and the connected appeals was

a split one the above reference and concerned

appeals, as per provision of sections 378 and 429 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure, were placed before

the learned Chief Justice for necessary order and the

learned Chief Justice appointed Mohammad Fazlul

Karim, J as Third Judge to dispose of the Death

Reference and the connected appeals.





13. The Third learned Judge then under the

provision of sections 378 and 429 of the Code ,

Criminal Procedure took up the hearing of the above

death reference and the appeals in respect of Only ¢,

accuseds including the appellant Mohiuddip

(Artillery) in respect of whom also the learneg

Judges of the Division Bench differed in their

opinion.



14. The Third learned Judge, after hearing,

on consideration of the facts and circumstances of

the case and materials available on record, took the

view that the prosecution has failed to prove the case

as against accuseds Major Ahmed Shariful Hossajp

alias Shariful Islam, Captain Md Kismat Hashem

and Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and having

found them as not guilty for the offence chargeg

acquitted them therefrom. The Third learned Judge,

however, found appellant Mohiuddin (Artillery),

accused Captain Abdul Mazed and Resalder Mos-

lemuddin alias Moslehuddin guilty for the offence

charged under sections 120B/302 and 34 of the

Penal Code and maintained their sentence of death

under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code agreeing

with ABM Khairul Haque J and accordingly,

accepted the Death Reference so far it related to

them and dismissed Criminal Appeal No.2617 of

1998 filed by the accused Lieutenant Colonel (Retd)

Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) and the conviction

and sentence of accuseds Captain Md Kismat

Hashem, Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain alias

Shariful Islam passed by the learned Sessions Judge,

Dhaka in Sessions Case No. 319 of 1997 was set

aside by the Third learned Judge holding them not

guilty agreeing with the view taken by Md Ruhul

Amin, J and accordingly, the Death Reference so far

as it related to Captain Md Kishmat Hashem,

Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and Major Ahmed

Shariful Hossain alias Shariful Islam was rejected.



15. Mohiuddin (Lancer) was tried and con-

victed in absentia due to his absconsion outside the

country and subsequently he was arrested from USA

and brought back in the country in July 2007 and

was sent to jail and he then filed Jail Petition No.9

of 2007 and subsequently filed an application for

condonation of delay stating that he had no know-

ledge of the case and the judgment of conviction and

sentence. This was opposed by the State by filing an



            
affidavit. On hearing both the sides the delay being

condoned he filed Criminal Petition for Leave to

Appeal No.343 of 2007 which was heard analo-

gously with Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal

Nos. 95, 96, 97 and 98 of 2001.



16. All the above mentioned petitions for

Jeave to appeal having raised the same question of

jaw and fact were disposed of by one leave granting

order granting leave as follows:



“(a) the leamed Judges of the Division Bench

of the High Court Division dealing with

the Death Reference and the connected cri-

minal appeals delivered two separate and

parallel judgments and signed their

individual judgment. These two separate

judgments signed separately cannot be

taken to be the judgment of the High Court

Division. This shows that the learned

Judges gave dissenting judgments and this

became palpable from the order dated 14-

12-2000 passed by the learned Judges

stating that the judgment given by them in

the Death Reference No.30 of 1998 was a

split one. Accordingly, the matter was

referred by the learned Judges to the

learned Chief Justice for necessary order.

Thereafter, the learned Chief Justice by

order dated 15-1-2001 appointed Mr

Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim as the

Third Judge to dispose of the Death

Reference as a whole meaning the case of

15 convicts. In this background of the

matter, it is strongly contended by the

learned Counsels that the Death Reference

case in its entirety was referred to the

Third Judge for disposal. Hence the

learned Third Judge having considered the

case of only 6(six) convicts committed an

error of law occasioning failure of justice.



(b) the occurrence took place in the early

morning on 15-8-1975, But the informant

PW | AFM Mohitul Islam was all along in

Dhaka after the occurrence and he joined

as a receptionist in the Bangabhaban on

3rd September, 1975 after the occurrence

and continued in service till he filed the

FIR on 2-10-1996 after a long lapse of



more than 21 years. This unreasonable

delay in lodging the FIR speaks of ill

intention and a design on the part of the

prosecution to falsely implicate the

convict petitioners in the occurrence on the

basis of concocted and manipulated evi-

dence to the prejudice of the convict peti-

tioners. The Courts below including the

High Court Division erred in failing to

consider this aspect while adjudging the

involvement of the convict petitioners in

the occurrence and also in convicting and

awarding capital sentence to them.



(c) although the evidence and materials on

record go to show that it was a case of

mutiny leading to the murder of the then

President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his

family members and not a case of murder

simpliciter but the convicts including the

convict petitioners were tried and con-

victed by a normal criminal Court as a case

of murder simpliciter. Hence the trial was

vitiated.



(d) the evidence and materials on record will

only show that there was no case of cri-

minal conspiracy for murder but a case of

criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny to

change the then Mujib Government.

Hence the conviction and sentence of the

convict petitioners are liable to be set

aside.



(e) charge of murder against the convict

petitioners under section 302 read with

section 34 of the Penal Code has not been

proved on the basis of proper evaluation

and sifting of evidence on record and thus

there has been a miscarriage of justice.”



As it appears at the trial, the prosecution tried to

establish its case against the appellants and other

accuseds on the basis of the evidence of the PWs,

confessional statement of appellants Faruque

Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (Artillery),

extra-judicial confession proved by PWs 15 and 8,

electronic evidence, and also circumstantial evi-

dence relating to conspiracy and, on the other hand,

the appellants and other accuseds tried to show that



            


they were innocent, the confessional statements of

the above three appellants were not voluntary and

the President and his family members were killed as

a consequence of a successful revolt of the army

against the then Government. Regarding the ground

that the Third learned Judge should have heard the

entire reference, ig. the cases of all the fifteen

convicts instead of six convicts only, the common

submissions of the learned Counsels for the

appellants are that since the learned Judges of the

High Court Division delivered dissenting opinions,

the Third learned Judge ought to have heard the

entire death reference but he heard the reference

only in respect of six accuseds and so the present

reference as well as the appeals should be sent back

on remand to the Third learned Judge for hearing of

the death reference and the appeals afresh.



17. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned

Counsel for appellants Faruque Rahman and Mohi-

uddin (Artillery), further submitted that the learned

Chief Justice referred to the Third leaned Judge the

entire death reference not the piecemeal reference

for his disposal and so the Third learned Judge

should have heard the entire reference; the judgment

impugned is not a judgment in the eye of law as the

learned Judges expressed their opinion separately

and signed their opinion in violation of the provi-

sions of section 377 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure; since the learned Judges of the High

Court Division heard death reference as well as the

appeals both sections 378 and 429 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure are applicable and so opinion of

Third learned Judge shall be the conclusive opinion

and judgment and the order shall follow on that

basis which was not done in the present appeals; the

opinion of the Third Judge is also in no way a con-

current opinion in respect of the appellants Faruque

Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (Artillery)

specially when the first learned Judge disbelieved

their confessional statements while the second

learned Judge believed those.



18 Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, the learned

Counsel for the appellant Sultan Shahriar, further

submitted that in the present appeals there is no

confirmation of sentence in the eye of law since

there is no consensus confirmation of the sentence

by the High Court Division; the opinion of the



learned Judges of the High Court Division in jh,

present case cannot also be regarded as “judgmeny:

and as held in the case of Md Shafi vs Crown 6 Dip

(WP) 104 (FB) and the case of Abdur Razik vs Stay,

16 DLR (WP) 73 in case of difference of Pinion

while confirming the sentence, the opinion of the

Third Judge will prevail; the learned Judges of the

High Court Division also did not consider the

principles as laid down in the case of Hethubha yy

State of Gujrat AIR 1970 SC 1266, Union of India \

Ananti Padmanabiah (1971) SCC (Crl) 533, Sajjan

Singh vs State of UP (1999 SCC 315 (Cri) 44 and

Mahim Mandal vs State 15 DLR 615 and committed

error in upholding the conviction and sentence.



19. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the learned

Counsel representing Major Md Bazlul Huda and

Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer), adopted

the submissions made by Khan Saifur Rahman and

Abdur Razaque Khan.



20. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Counsel

(chief prosecutor) appearing for State, submitted

that the Third leamed Judge is perfectly justified in

hearing the case of six convicts only in respect of

whom the learned Judges of the High Court

Division were equally divided in their opinion;

section 377 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure

merely relates to the procedure for confirmation in

respect of reference made under section 374 of the

Code; the words “as he thinks fit” and the words

“the judgment and order shall follow such opinion”

used in sections 378 and 429 of the Code are signi-

ficant and a close reading of the above expressions

show that a wide discretion has been given to the

Third Judge by the legislature to decide the case

either in respect of whom there is no difference of

opinion or in respect of whom there is difference of

opinion, and the judgment and order shall follow

such opinion; in the present appeals the Third

learned Judge, exercising his discretion, passed

order dated 6-2-2001 holding that “the case of above

9 condemned prisoners over whom the learned

Judges not being divided in opinion are not contem-

plated to be heard both under the provisions of

sections 378 and 429 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, But only the case of accused Abdul

Mazed over whom there is difference as regard the

conviction under the two separate sections of the



            
 penal Code and the cases of those five other

condemned prisoners over which the learned Judges

re equally divided in OPINION ccc ", and

cordingly, the Third learned Judge duly disposed

y the reference and the appeals by confirming the

vqtenc€ of nine convicts including the appellants

which is in conformity with the requirements as

provided in sections 378 and 429 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.



21. In support of the above submissions Mr

Haq referred to the cases of Babu vs State’ of UP

IR] 065 SC 467), Union of India vs Ananti Pad-

wn anabiah AIR 1971 SC 1836 Tanviven Pankaj-

kumar Divetia vs State of Guajrat (1997) 1 SCC 156

~ AIR 1997 SC 2193, Sharat Chandra Mirta vs



mperor ILR 38 Cal 202, Ahmed Sher vs Emperor,

AJR 1931 Lah 513, Subedor Singh vs Emperor AIR

1943 Allahabad 272, Nemai Mandal vs State of West

pengal AIR 1966 Cal 194, State of UP vs Dan Singh

(1997) 3 SCC 747, Granda Venkata vs Corporation

of Calcutta (22 CWN 745), State vs Abul Khair 44

DLR 284.



22. While endorsing the said submissions,

the learned Attorney-General and Mr Ajmalul

Hossain QC added some points and cited some

decisions. Mr Ajmalul Hossain contends that there is

fundamental difference in sections 378 and 429 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure, inasmuch as while

in section 378 the expression “a bench of Judges”

has been used in section 429 the expression “the

Judges composing the Court of Appeal” has been

used and again in section 429 the expressions “of

the same Court” have not been used as used in the

other section. The learned Counsel further added

that a reference is required to be heard by at least

two Judges and the expression “bench of Judges”

used in section 378 means the sentence should have

to be confirmed and signed by at least two Judges

for the execution and a close reading of sections

374-378 would infer that the question of opinion of

the Third Judge arises when there is difference of

opinion of a bench of Judges and in a case where

there was no difference of opinion in respect of a

particular accused or accuseds the Third Judge was

left with no business to deal with his case and his

Opinion.



Major BAZLUL HUDpA V8 STATE (MA Tifred Ion Sy



23, The provisions of sections 374,

376, 377, 474 and 429 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure are reproduced below:



“374, Sentence of death to be submitted hy

Court--When the Court of Sessions passes

semence of death, the proceeding shall be

submitted to the (High Court Division] and the

sentence shall not be executed unless it is

confirmed by the [High Court Division].



376, Power of High Court Division to

confirm sentence or annul conviction, In any

case submitted under section 374, the High

Court Division— :



(a) may confirm the sentence, or pass any

other sentence warranted by law, or



(b) may annul conviction, and convict the

accused of any offence of which the Sessions

Court might have convicted him, or order a new

trial on the same or an amended charge, or



(c) may acquit the accused person:



Provided that no order of confirmation

shall be made under this section until the period

allowed for preferring an appeal has expired, or,

if an appeal is presented within such period,

until such appeal is disposed of.



“377. In every case so submitted, the

confirmation of the sentence, or any new

sentence or order passed by the High Court

Division shall, when such Court consists of two

ér more Judges, be made, passed and signed by

at least two of them.”



“378. When any such case is heard before

a bench of Judges and such Judges are equally

divided in opinion, the case, with their opinions

thereon, shall be laid before another Judge, and

such Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit

shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or

other shall follow such opinion.”



“429, When the Judges composing the

Court of Appeal are equally divided in opinion,

the case, with their opinions thereon shall be

laid before another Judge of the same Court,

and such Judge after such hearing (if any) as he



            
thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the

judgment or order shall follow such opinion.



The above provisions show that Whenever a

sentence of death is passed by a Court of Sessions

the proceedings of the case shall be submitted to the

Hich Court Division for the confirmation of

sentence under section 374 of the Code, In dealing

with a proceeding under section 374 the High Court

Division itself acts on its appellate side power

irrespective of whether the accused sentenced to

death preferred an appeal or not and accordingly, the

Hich Court Division is bound to consider the

evidence and then arrive at an independent

conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the

accused. The power of the High Court Division to

confirm the sentence is provided in section 376 of

the Code. A duty is imposed upon the High Court

Division to satisfy itself that the conviction of the

accused is justified on the evidence and that the

sentence of death in the circumstances of the case is

and appropriate one.



24. It also appears that though section 378 is

included in chapter XXVII of the Code of Criminal

Procedure under the heading “OF THE SUBMIS-

SION OF SENTENCES FOR CONFIRMATION”

and section 429 is included in chapter XXXI under

the heading “OF APPEALS” but the language used

in both the sections is almost identical. The

expressions “as he thinks fit” used in both the

sections postulate that the Third Judge is completely

free in resolving the difference as he thinks fit and

accordingly if he decides that there is no need to

hear the arguments in respect of any accused of

whom the Judges are not divided in their opinion, he

may decline to do so, It also appears that the use of

the words “equally divided” in both the sections

means the Judges differ in their opinions, in respect

of complicity of an accused or on the charge framed

against him or on any particular point but in a case

where the Judges concur with each other in respect

of a particular accused and in respect of the offence

charged, it cannot be said that Judges are equally

divided in respect, of the accused charged with,



25. On construction of sections 378 and 429

views taken by different High Courts are that what

is laid before another Judge is the “case” and

secondly, the judgment or order shall follow the

opinion given by such Judge and the opinion OF t

Third Judge will be regarded as the final juldgment.



26. In the case of Sarat Chandra Mitra vs 

Emperor ILR 38 Cal 202, it was observed:



“I am not now concerned with the question,

of the trial of two petitioners with regard, to

one of who in the Judges composing the Court

of Appeal may be agreed in their opinion, While

as regards the others the Judges may be equally

divided in opinion. In such a contingency it is

quite possible to maintain the view that, upon p

reasonable interpretation of the term “case

what has to be laid before another Judge is the,

case of the prisoner as to whom the Judges are

equally divided in opinion. I am now concerned

only with the contingency in which the Judges

of the Court of Appeal are already divided in

opinion upon the question of the guilt of one

accused person, though upon certain aspects of

the case they may be agreed in their view, [n

such a contingency, what is laid before another

Judge, is, not the point or points upon which the

Judges are equally divided in opinion, but the

“case”. These obviously mean that, so far as the

particular accused is concerned, the whole case

is laid before the Third Judge, and it is his duty

to consider all the points involved, before he

delivers his opinion upon the case.”



As it appears in the case of Ahmed Sher vs Emperor

AIR 1931 (Lah) 513, Subeder Singh vs Emperor, AIR

1943 All 272, Nemai Mandal vs State of West

Bengal, AIR 1966 Cal 194 the above views have

been followed.



27. In the case of Mohim Mandal vs State,

15 DLR 615 it was however observed that the

expression “difference of opinion” as used in the

sections 378 and 429 of the Code may be either as

regards the guilt or innocence of the accused or as to

the proper sentence to be passed. In either of these

cases the sections require the reference to be made

to another Judge. The Judge before whom the case

is laid for his opinion is entitled to pass any order he

thinks proper including an order directing retrial of

the accused. While confirming the sentence one

Judge may not accept a piece of evidence but accept!

the conviction and sentence in respect of an accused



            


person but that does not mean that there is difference of opinion as regards conviction and sentence.

In the case of Babu vs State of (Supra),

on purport and power of the Third Judge came

sideration before a five-member Constitutional

up Bench of the Supreme Court of India. In that

rion pivision Bench differed in their opinions in

case and the conviction of three accused persons

and delivered two separate judgments. Before the

an ne Court the competency of the appeal was





“The section (S 429) contemplates that it is



for the Third Judge to decide on what points he

chall hear the arguments, if any, and that postu-

Jates that he is completely free in resolving the

difference as he thinks fit. In our judgment, it

was sufficient for Takru, J, to have said on the

question of the First Information Report that he

gid not consider it necessary to decide the point

put it was necessary, he was in agreement with

all that Mathur, J had said. There was, therefore,

a proper decision by Takru, J, and the certificate

could not be based upon the omission to discuss

the First Information Report and the doubts

about it.”



29. In the case of Hethubha (Supra) the

Supreme Court of India observed as follows:



“This Court in Babu vs State of Uttar

Pradesh, (1965) 2 SCR 771= (AIR 1965 SC

1467) held that it was for the Third learned

Judge to decide on what points the arguments

would be heard and therefore he was free to

resolve the differences as he thought fit. Mehta,

Jhere dealt with the whole case. Section 429 of

the Criminal Procedure Code states “that when

the Judges comprising the Court of Appeal are

equally divided in opinion, the case with their

opinion thereon, shall be laid before another

Judge of the same Court and such Judge, after

such hearing, if any, as he thinks fit, shall

deliver his opinion, and the Judgment and order

shall follow such opinion”. Two things are

noticeable; first, that the case shall be laid

before another Judge, and, secondly, the Judg-

ment and order will follow the opinion of the



Third learned Judge. It is, therefore, manifest

that the Third learned Judge 

With the whole case,”



30. In the case of Ananti P.

(supra) as it appears the Division Bench of the High

Court of Assam and Nagaland unanimously rejected

the first two contentions but were divided in their

Opinions on the points as to Whether the Magistrate

applied his mind to allow the investigating agency

lo investigate the cases and whether sanction under

section 196A wag necessary. The matter was then



laid before a Third Judge. The Third Judge held that

the Magistrate acted without



the investigating



an or will deal



admanahiah



jurisdiction in allowing

agency to investigate into the

matter and accordingly he quashed the proceedings.

The question in dispute was whether a new point as

to the competency of the Magistrate at Delhi to

sanction investigation could have been raised before

the Third Judge since the said point had not been

raised before the Division Bench. AN Ray, J of the

Supreme Court approved the views taken in Het-

hubha Case (supra) wherein it was observed that

“the Third learned Judge could deal with the whole

case” and that there is no dispute in the statement of

law and it is in the discretion of the Third Judged to

deal with the case and in deciding the case if any

point is found necessary, he can decide the said

point as well. However in India, after amendment in

1973 section 429 was substituted by section 392

which reads as follows:



“392. Procedure where Judges of Court of

appeal are equally divided—When an appeal

under this Chapter is heard by a High Court

before a Bench of Judges and they are divided

in opinion, the appeal, with their opinions, shall

be laid before another Judge of that Court, and

that Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit,

shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or

order shall follow that opinion;



Provided that if one of the Judges constitu-

ting the Bench, or where the appeal is laid

before another Judge under this section, that

Judge, so requires, the appeal shall be reheard

and decided by a larger Bench of Judges.”



It appears that the addition of a proviso as

above authorises one of the Judges constituting the

Division Bench or the Third Judge of a High Court



            
of India, if so desires, can refer the appeal to a larger

Bench for rehearing and decision by such Bench of

Judges. The legislature has resolved the controversy

by addition of the proviso, in my view, in order to

remove the doubt about the conflicting views of the

Supreme Court of India, Under the present position,

fer the if the Division Bench requires, it may be

appeal for rehearing by a larger Bench of Judges if

there is difference of opinion on any point or points.

Similarly the Third Judge has been given the similar

discretionary power to refer the appeal to a larger

Bench if he does not agree with the opinion of the

Division Bench on any of the points involved in the

appeal decided by them.



31. In Tanviben Pankaj Kumar Divetia vs

State of Gujarat (supra) it was observed:



“The plain reading of section 392 (our S



429) clearly indicates that it is for the Third



Judge to decide on what points he shall hear



arguments, if any, and it necessarily postulates



that the Third Judge is free to decide the appeal

by resolving the difference in the manner he

thinks proper.”



32. In State of UPV Dan Singh, (1997) 3

SCC 747 however two-member Bench of the Sup-

reme Court without considering the previous

decisions observed as follows:



“When the appeal as a whole is heard by

the Third Judge, he not only has an option of

delivering his opinion but, under the proviso to

section 392 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

he may require the appeal to be reheard and

decided by a large Bench of Judges. This was

an option which, under the provision, was also

open for any one of the two Judges, namely, BN

Katju and Rajeshwar Singh, JJ to exercise, but

they chose not to do so, What is clearly evident

is that the appeal is finally disposed of by the

judgment and order which follows the opinion

of the Third Judge. This being so special leave

petition could only have been filed after the

appeal was disposed of by the High Court vide

its final order dated 19-5-1988. Even though the



said order purports to be related only to ten out

of thirty-two accused the said order has to be

read along with the earlier order of [5-4-1987

and, in law, the effect would be that the order





dated 19-5-1988 will be regarded as the final,

order whereby the appeal of the State was Party

allowed, with only two of the thirty-two,,

accused being convicted under section 325 reqq

with section 34, IPC, while all the other ACCUSEY



were acquitted.”



43, In Sajjan Singh (1999) SCC (Crip qq

also a Division Bench of the Supreme Court

ignoring the views taken in Babu’s Case, AIR 1965

SC 1467, and Hetubha Case, AIR 1970 SC 1266 dig

not approve the opinion taken by the Third Judge

and observed as follows:



“Statement of law is now quite explicit, I,

is the Third Judge whose opinion matters;

against the judgment that follows therefrom that

an appeal lies to this Court by way of special

leave petition under Article 136 of the Constj-

tution or under Article 134 of the Constitution

or under section 379 of the Code. The Third

Judge is, therefore, required to examine whole

of the case independently and it cannot be said

that he is bound by that part of the two opinions

of the two Judges comprising the Division

Bench where there is no difference. As a matter

of fact, the Third Judge is not bound by any

such opinion of the Division Bench. He is not

hearing the matter as if he is sitting in a three

Judge Bench where the opinion of majority

would prevail. We are thus of the opinion that

Prasad, J was not right in his approach and his

hands were not tied as far as the three appel-

lants, namely, Gajraj Singh, Meharban Singh

and Baboo Singh before him were concerned in

respect of whom both Judges of the Division

Bench opined that they were guilty and their

conviction and sentences were to be upheld.”



However in Sajjan Singh’s case despite the above

observations, the Court did not interfere with the

opinion of the Third Judge on the reasonings that

“Since we have heard the matter in respect of all the

three appellants at length we do not think it is

desirable now at this stage to remand the matter

when only some of the appellants could be said to

have been prejudiced because of the approach

adopted by Prasad, J”. The Supreme Court

thereupon heard the appeal on merit and dismissed

the appeal.



            
 34. ‘In the case of the State vs Abdul Khair

(supra) out of 3 accuseds, one committed the mur-

der and two others were standing with the motor-

bikes and convicted under sections 302/34 PC, But

in a split judgment on appeal, one Jearned Judge

acquitted two others. The Third Judge on an appeal

under section 429 of the Code only heard the case of

two others leaving the case of the condemned

accused who committed the murder.



35. Similar view finds support in the case of

Nemai Mondal vs State of West Bengal AIR 1966

Cal 194 where it was held that “The case with the

differing opinion is placed before the Third J udge. It

is the duty of the Third Judge to decide the case and

not merely the points on which two Judges have

differed.



36. Inthe case Bhagat Ram vs State of Raj-

sthan AIR 1972 SC 1502 the appeal filed by the

State against the acquittal of two accuseds B and R

of offences under sections 120B, 218, 347, 389

Penal Code is dismissed but there being difference

of opinion between the Judges of the Division

Bench as regards the correctness of the order of

acquittal of B in respect of offence under section

161, Penal Code and section 5(1)(a), Prevention of

Corruption Act and then the matter was referred to a

Third Judge under section 429, CrPC and the

Supreme Court of India, in view of above position

observed that it is not open to the Third Judge to

reopen the matter of acquittal of B in respect of

offences under sections 120B, 218, 347 for which an

express order had been made by the Division Bench

upholding the order of acquittal of the trial Judge

and that since the whole case had not been referred

under section 429 CrPC the Third Judge could go

only into the point of difference and arrive at his

conclusion.



37. As it appears in the case of Muhammad

Shafi vs Crown, 6 DLR (WP) 104 (FB) as referred by

the appellants, the learned Judges agreed with the

contention that “the Third Judge was exercising the

authority of a Bench of Judges and that, therefore,

he should consider for the purposes of section 12 of

the Sind Courts Act not as a single Judge, but as a

Bench”. | am of the view that the above case has no

manner of application in this case.



38. In the case of Abdur Raziq vs State 16



DLR (WP) 73 it was observed that—



“there is nowhere laid down in sections

378 and 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code,

that the Third Judge should follow or may

follow the opinion of the Judge who has given

his opinion favouring the accused.” But

however if this proposition is accepted, then

there would have been no necessity in using the

expressions “such Judge, after such hearing as

he thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the

judgment or order shall follow such opinion” in

section 378 of the Code.



39. As it appears the views taken by five-



member constitution bench of the Indian Supreme

Court in Babu'’s case (AIR 1965 SC 1467), holds the

field on the point and the said decision has been



followed in later cases as well and this is no cogent



ground to depart from those views as they are based

on correct construction of the provisions of law.



40. Further, even if it is assumed that the



Third learned Judge ought to have heard the



reference in respect of all the convicts, as we have

heard the appeals of the appellants at length on merit

as was done in Sajjan Singhs case (supra), the

appellants could not be said to have been prejudiced.



41. Regarding the submission made in

respect of “judgment” it appears that in view of the

difference of opinion as regards conviction of 6

accused persons the Division Bench by order dated

14th December, 2000 passed the following order:



“Death Reference accepted in part, CrlA

2604 of 1998, 2613 of 1998, and 2616 of 1998

‘are dismissed. CrlA 2617 of 1998 is allowed by

Mr Justice Md Ruhul Amin by judgment in

separate sheets. BO Death Reference accepted

in part, CrlA 2604 of 1998, 2613 of 1998, 2616

of 1998 and 2617 of 1998 are dismissed by Mr

Justice ABM Khairul Haque vide judgment in

separate sheets.”



BO “14-12-2000. As the judgment in Death

Reference No, 30 of 1998 is split one, let the

matter, as per provision of section 378 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure be placed before



            
 the learned Chief Justice for necessary orders,

Md Ruhul Amin ABM Khairal Haque, JJ.



42. Thereafter, the appellants filed applica-

tions before the Third leamed Judge praying for

hearing the death reference in respect of all the con-

demned prisoners for ends of justice and the Third

learned Judge, after hearing heard the learned

Counsel at length, by order dated 6th February, 2001

rejected the application on the following reasons:



“In view of the discussion above and

equally divided opinion of the learned Judges of

the Division Bench, | am of the opinion that the

cases of above 9 condemned prisoners over

whom the learned Judges not being divided in

opinion are not contemplated to be heard both

under the provisions of sections 378 and 429,

CrPC. But only the case of accused Abdul

Majed over whom there is difference as regards

the conviction under the two separate sections

of the Penal Code and cases of those 5 other

condemned prisoners over which the learned

Judges are equally divided in opinion i.e.

convicted by one learned Judge and acquitted

by another learned Judge, are before this Court

for an opinion. Upon delivery of the opinion by

this Court, the judgment and order shall follow

such opinion in order to dispose of the entire

death reference.”



43. As it appears the appellants did not take

any exception to the aforesaid order of the Third

learned Judge and the learned Counsels on their

behalf then argued the appeals and the death

reference. Then the Third Jearned Judge, after

hearing, gave opinion as follows:



“In view of the discussions, reasons and

findings above in the body of this judgment, in

my opinion, accused Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-

uddin Ahmed (Artillery), Captain Abdul Mazed

and Resalder Moslemuddin @ Muslehuddin

were rightly convicted under sections 120B and

302/34 PC and sentenced to death under

sections 302/34 Penal Code by the learned

Sessions Judge, Dhaka and agreeing with my

learned brother ABM Khairul Hoque, J the



Death Reference, so far as it relates to Lieu-

tenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery),



Captain Abdul Mazed and Resalder Moslem.

uddin @ Moslehuddin, is accepted and the

Criminal Appeal No.2617 of 1998 filed by

accused Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed

(Artillery) is dismissed but the conviction and

sentence of accused Captain Md Kismat

Hashem, Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and

Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful

Islam passed by the learned Session Judge,

Dhaka in Sessions case No.319/97 are liable to

be set aside and the same are accordingly set

aside and accordingly, agreeing with my

brother Md Ruhul Amin J, the Death Reference

so far as it relates to Captain Md Kismat

Hashem, Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and

Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful

Islam is rejected.”



44. Then followed the judgment and order

dated 30th April, 2001 of the High Court Division

maintaining the conviction and sentence in respect

of three condemned prisoners including the appel-

lant Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) and accepting

their death reference and disposing the death

reference which is as follows:



“In the result, Death Reference No.30 of

1998 so far as it relates to Lieutenant Colonel

Syed Farook Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel

Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Lieutenant

Colonel Khandker Abdur Rashid, Major Md

Bazlul Huda, Lieutenant Colonel Shariful

Hoque Dalim, BU Lieutenant Colonel AM

Rashed Chowdhury, Lieutenant Colonel AKM

Mohiuddin (Lancer), Lieutenant Colonel

SHBM Nur ‘Chowdhury, Lieutenant Colonel

Md Aziz Pasha, Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin

Ahmed (Artillery), Resalder Moslemuddin @

Moslehuddin and Captain Abdul Mazed is

accepted confirming the death sentence and

accordingly, Criminal Appeal No.2616 of 1998

filed by accused Lieutenant Colonel Syed

Farook Rahman, Criminal Appeal No.2604 of

1998 filed by accused Lieutenant Colonel

Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Criminal Appeal

No. 2613 of 1998 filed by accused Major Md

Bazlul Huda and Criminal Appeal No.2617 of

1998 filed by Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin

Ahmed (Artillery) are dismissed but Death





            
Reference No.30 of 1998 so far it relates to

accused Captain Md Kismat Hashem, Major

Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful Islam and

Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar is rejected and

the conviction and the sentence of these

accused are accordingly set aside and thereby

acquitting them of the charges levelled against

them in this case.”



45. Lamof the view that the above judgment

and order of the Third learned Judge is absolutely in

accordance with the provision of sections 378 and

429 of the Code. Regarding the second ground i.e.

delay, the leamed Counsels for the appellants

submitted that there is inordinate delay in lodging

the FIR and this unreasonable delay of 21 years

enabled the prosecution to introduce concocted

story for implicating the appellants and other

accuseds falsely by collecting manipulated evidence

which caused prejudice to the appellants and further

even if it is assumed that this delay has been caused

due to the promulgation of the Indemnity Ordi-

nance, 1975 but there is no explanation for about

three months from 26-6-1996, i.e. the date after

Awami League came to power.



46. Mr Anisul Huq, and the learned Attor-

ney-General, on the other hand, submitted that the

prosecution not only had explained the reasons but

qalso demonstrated cogent evidence to substantiate

WNthe cause for delay in lodging the FIR and the

inability of the informant to lodge the FIR after the

<occurrence due to the fact that the successive

op Governments expressly as well as impliedly pre-

vented the institution of the case against the appel-

lants and other accused persons by promulgating

Indemnity Ordinance 1975 and protected the

appellants and other accuseds persons as would be

evident from the fact that after the incidents the

appellants and other accuseds not only remained

under the shelter of the then governments but also

held influential and powerful positions and Major

Rashid contested the general election in 1996 who

along with Farook Rahman floated a political party

under the name “Freedom Party” and Farook

Rahman also contested the election in 1980, and

Bazlul Huda was the Secretary of the “Freedom

Party” and further after General Ziaur Rahman came

to power he rewarded most of the accused persons



21 involved in the killing of the President and his



family by appointing them in foreign missions, even



they openly declared themselves as killers of the



then President and his family and that this being an



exceptional case in which then successive Govern-



ments sheltered and protected the accused persons



including the appellants, the informant was

apprehensive of his life by taking risk of filing any

case till the Bangladesh Awami League came into

power in the year 1996. In support of the above

submissions the learned Counsels for the State

referred the cases of State vs Fazal, 39 DLR (AD)

166, Md Shamsuddin @ Lalu vs State, 40 DLR (AD)

69, Tara Singh vs State of Punjab 1991 Supp (1)

SCC 536, Jamna vs State of UP 1994 Supp(1) SCC

185 and State of HP vs Shreekanthia Shekari (2004)

8 SCC 153. As it appears the learned Judges of the

High Court Division believed the explanation for

delay and observed that the prosecution has been

able to explain the delay by assigning cogent reason.



47. The first learned Judge observed:



“In the present case delay in lodging the

FIR has sufficiently been explained and in view

of the matter the contention that FIR has been

lodged after lapse of several years change of

manipulation and false implication can all

together to be not ruled out merits no consi-

deration.”



48. The second learned Judge observed:



“In this case from the evidence of PW 44

and other witnesses, the most accused persons

used to stay in Banga Bhaban since 15th

August, 1975 and in the name of an unwritten

command council used to govern the country

till they were made to leave on the 4th Novem-

ber, 1975. Still though they were not without

influence. The accused Major Syed Farook

Rahman tried to force a mutiny at Savar and

Bogra Cantonments and the accused Major

Khondker Abdur Rashid tried unsuccessfully to

take over the command of 2nd Field Artillery

Regiment in 1976, Again in 1980 they made

another attempt to overthrow the Government

but still no Government took any punitive

action against any of them; rather they were all

given their arrear salaries. The accused Major



            
 Syed Farook Rahman even contested the Pre-

sidential election in 1986 (PW 44), So the appre

hension of the informant about his life and limb

cannot be said to be unreasonable. Under such

circumstances, the delay in lodging the PIR

cannot vitiate the trial, after all it is always for

prove its case on evidence, as the prosecution to

Counsel such, and the contention of the learned

on behalf of the appellants about the delay in



lodging the FIR has got no substance.”



The Third learned Judge also believed

ay. The learned Judges also

f this sub-continent in



49,

the explanation of del

cited many decisions 0

support of their reasonings.



50. It is true delay in lodging the FIR some-

times results to embellishment by creature of after-

thoughts. But the consistent views of the Superior

Courts are that mere delay in lodging a case is not a

cround for disbelieving a prosecution case, for there

are various circumstances in which lodging any case



as to the commission of offence may be delayed.



51. However, as observed in the case of

Shreekantthia (supra) the delay in lodging the first

information report puts the Court on guard to search

for and consider if any explanation has been offered

for the delay. Once it is offered, the Court is to only

see whether it is satisfactory or not. In case the

prosecution fails to explain the delay satisfactorily

and there is possibility of embellishment or

exaggeration in the prosecution version on account

of such delay then this possibility becomes a rele-

vant factor. On the other hand, satisfactory expla-

nation of the delay is enough to reject the plea of

false implication or vulnerability of the prosecution

case.



52. In the present case the informant in the

FIR has implicated only 14 accused persons in the

FIR and out of them he made specific allegation of

overt act only against Bazlul Huda and identified

three other accused persons and implicated rest of

the accused persons from the informations collected



from other sources. If the informant had il] motive to

implicate and/or embellish facts against the appel-

lants and other accused persons, he could have

vividly mentioned in the FIR the role played by each

accused person, but he did not resort to that path and this shows that this FIR is the true version what the informant has seen at the place of occurrence ang

whatever evidence that have been collected againt,

the appellants and other accused persons about their

complicity by the investigating agency were in the

course of the investigation of the case.



53. Further, as it appears, after the incident

Khondker Mustaque Ahmed usurped the power and

proclaimed Martial Law on 20th August, 1975 and

assumed the office of the President of Bangladesh

with retrospective effect from 15th August, 1975

and then he promulgated the Indemnity Ordinance,

1975 on 26th September, 1975 putting restriction on

taking of any legal or other proceedings against

persons in respect of certain acts, things, committed

by those persons in connection with, or in prepa-

ration or execution of any plan for, or necessary

steps towards the change of the Government of

Bangladesh. As it appears whether or not an FIR

could have been lodged even after the promulgation

of the said Ordinance was a matter of interpretation

of law and further the above Ordinance has also



made psychological impact.



54. Further, as Lieutenant Colonel Shafayat

Jamil (PW 44) stated in his deposition, the appellant

Farook Rahman and condemned convict Major

Rashid always stayed in the Bangabhaban and their

accomplice officers stayed in the Radio Station and

used to maintain contact among them by constitu-

ting an unwritten Revolutionary Command Council

and ruled the country under the leadership of

Khondker Mustaque Ahmed and that it was not

possible for taking legal action against the killers of

15th August as the killers were being given

protection by the Governments in power after the



incident till 1996.



55. Admittedly, the then President and all

other members of his family found in the house

were brutally killed. Had the Government in power

had not supported the above killing, it was the

bounden duty of the Governments in power 10

institute a case for ascertaining the cause for the

death and bring the killers to justice but, in this

particular case, the process of law has not been

allowed to take its own course, rather by promul-

gating Indemnity Ordinance 1975 the Government

in power wanted to protect the accuseds including



|



            
the appellants and further, though some of them

were initially removed army officers, they were also

absorbed in the Foreign Ministry and were

appointed in the Foreign Missions.



56. Further as the law stands, if no case was

instituted against the killers of the elected President

of the country by anyone on behalf of the victims,

the Government “according to law” was under obli-

gations to institute a case, specially when an elected

President was brutally killed along with his family

and further, the appellants along with other accuseds

not only committed an offence of murder, they also

committed atrocities against humanity by killing a

child and three innocent women. Further, the above

offence of murder being a cognizable offence, if no

FIR was lodged on behalf of the victims for such an

offence, the officer-in-charge of the Dhanmondi

Police Station was under an obligation to hold

investigation into the offence without an order of a

Magistrate and to submit his report under section

173 of the Code.



57. The leamed Attorney-General and Mr

Azmalul Hossain expressing their concern about the

mode of dispensation of justice by the then Govern-

ments in power submitted that the justice delivery

system has failed in all respects during the relevant

time which cannot be exonerated and this failure of

the justice delivery system has colossal and

catastrophic affect in the country which should not

be allowed to recur for the interest of the country.

This, according Mr Hossain, is a part of the history

that cannot be erased—the entire administration,

from top to the bottom, failed to perform their res-

ponsibilities which will be termed as a scandalous

chapter in our history and this sort of practice should



be stopped forever and it should not be allowed to

repeat again.



58. The above submissions have substance

as justice is related to law and justice differs from

benevolence, generosity, gratitude, friendship and

compassion and justice consists of maintaining the

societal sfatus quo and further the concept of

impartiality is at the core of the system of criminal

justice. Further, a Government is not of men but of

laws. When law ends tyranny begins. Law is the

very antithesis of arbitrary power. Further, among

different types of felonies, an offence of murder or

an order to commit murder is obviously illegal and

immoral and that is why the Nazis never tried to

legalise genocide and the orders to kill the concen-

tration camp inmates were always couched in veiled

terms and even the Nazis recognised that such

conduct could never be justified in terms of any

system of law.



59. The criminal justice system in a country

is designed to protect the citizens of the country

from the onslaught of criminal activities of a section

of people who indulges in such acts. State as a

guardian of fundamental rights of its citizens is duty

bound to ensure the administration of justice and the

rule of law. It is in the interest of the people that the

guilt of the offender who has indulged in criminal

activity is determined as quickly as possible. But,

unfortunately, this concept has been ignored after

killing of the then President of the country and other

members of his family. In order to have a strong

socio-economic system, it is important that each and

every offender involved in crime should be put to

justice and his trial should move at reasonably fast

pace. The challenges before the criminal justice

system are to balance the rights of the citizen as well

as of the accused while dispensing speedy and

effective justice in order to ensure a welfare state for

its citizens. Rule of law is meaningless unless there

is access to justice for the common people.



60. It seems to me the learned Judges have

given cogent reasons in believing the explanation of

delay given by the prosecution. Further this being a

finding of fact based on evidence on record, the

scope of this Division to interfere under Article

103(3) of the Constitution is very limited.



61. Solam of the view that the delay being

reasonably explained, no interference is called from

this Division. Regarding the Third ground, i.e.

Mutiny, the leamed Counsels for the appellants

made common submission that the evidence on

record revealed that the killing of the President and

the members of his family and the change of power

on 15th August, 1975 was a result of mutiny by

some army officers and therefore the trial ought to

have been held by Court Martial under the

provisions of Army Act, 1952 and accordingly the

trial of the appellants under the provision of the

Code of Criminal Procedure was without juridiction



            
 and in support of this submission sections

31(a), 59(3), 92(2), 94 and 95 of the Army Act,

sections § and 139 of the Penal Code and section

594(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure were

referred.



62. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman further submit-

ted that the instant incident originated from Dhaka

Cantonment on the night of 14th August from which

it is apparent that it was a mutiny simpliciter and

further there was also no agreement or criminal cons-



piracy or premeditated plan or pre-arranged plan,

within the meaning of section 34 or section 120A of



the Penal Code. The learned Counsel further argued

even if when any retired army officer or any other

person not subject to Army Act joined in the

occurrence on the night following 14th August,

1975 would also constitute a mutiny within the

ambit of section 31 of the Army Act and accord-

ingly, they also ought to have been tried by a Court

Martial under the Army Act and moreover, there is

similarity in the killings of the President as in the

present appeals and General Ziaur Rahman as in

hoth the cases they were Presidents of the Republic

and they were killed by the army personnel and in

the present appeals the officers and jawans army

from artillery and lancer units came out from Dhaka

Cantonment and killed the President at dawn on

15th August, 1975 at his official residence, whereas,

in case of Genera] Ziaur Rahman the army came out

from Chittagong Cantonment and killed him at Cir-

cuit House where he was staying on the night

following 29th May, 1981 and since both the occur-

rences were committed in similar manner, the

appellants, if they were at all involved in the

incident of 15th August, ought to have been tried by

a Court-Martial as was done in case of General

Ziaur Rahman. Further, the President, being the

commander-in-chief of the armed forces, for his

killing, trial ought to have been held before Court

Martial. In support of this contention the learned

Counsel has referred the case of Jamil Huq vs



Bangladesh, 34 DLR (SC) 125.



63. Mr Anisul Hug, on the other hand, con-

tended that the incident is not a mutiny, rather it is a

preplanned murder and therefore, there is no legal

bar for the trial of the appellants under the provi-

sions of the Code of Criminal Procedure as would



Mason Bazin Huns vs STATE (Md Teferced Islam J)



appear from the provisions of sections 59, 92, 94

and 95 of the Army Act 1952, section 35 of the Navy

Ordinance 1961 and section 549 of the Code of C53.

minal Procedure. Learned Attorney-General endor.

sing the above submissions of Mr Hug added thay

the appellants did not raise this point in the triay

Court and raised it for the first time in the High

Court Division with malafide motive in order to

confuse the Court and further the evidence on record

do not support a case of mutiny and rather disclosed

a case of murder and accordingly, charges against

the appellants were duly framed and even if it is

assumed the incident is a ‘civil offence’ within the

meaning of section 8(2) read with section 59(2) of

the Army Act, in view of section 94 of the Army Act

the Criminal Court has concurrent jurisdiction to try

such offence.



64. Mr Tawfique Nawaz, the learned Coun-

sel for the State, submitted that the entire scheme of

the constitutional and legal personality of the Presi-

dent as was provided in some 59 Articles of the

Constitution which were in force at the time of the

killing of the then President are very explicit and

accordingly, the legal personality and the status,

functions and immunities as enjoyed by the then

President under the Constitution is to be considered

on the basis of constitutional provisions instead of

merely considering his position merely on the basis

of one single Act i.e. Army Act 1952 or a provision

therein for treating him as “army personnel” for

being the “commander in chief” and accordingly the

trial of the appellants by criminal Court instead of

Court Martial was lawful.



65. As it appears the defence did not take

any plea of “mutiny” while cross-examining or

giving suggestions to the prosecution witnesses.

Since the prosecution witnesses did not say anything

in support of the defence plea of mutiny, the defence

ought to have suggested to the prosecution witnes-

ses that the involved officers and jawans in the

mutiny submitted their charter of demands and as

their demands were not acceded to, they killed the

President but on the contrary it was suggested to PW

24 on behalf of Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook

Rahman that at that time when Major Dalim was

broadcasting the news of the killing, PW 24, had

knowledge about declaration of Martial Law and



            
that Khondker Mustaque Ahmed became the Chief

Martial Law Administrator. From this suggestion

the defence Wanted to make out a case that after the

killing of the President, Martial Law was declared

; Khondker Mustaque Ahmed became the Presi-

dent and the Chief Martial Law Administrator of the

country and by this suggestion the defence wanted

to make out a case that since the killing was the

consequence of a successfull army insurrection, such

killing would not constitute an offence of murder.



66. However, as it appears as per provisions

of the Constitution, after the killing of the President,

the then Vice-President ought to have assumed the

office as President but this time this constitutional



rovisions were ignored. Further, if there was a

mutiny, the officers and jawans involved in the

incident should have been put on trial for mutiny

under the Army Act by the Government in power

but no such action was taken, rather the killers were

rewarded by the Government. Md Reajul Haque

Pw 37), a employee of Radio Station, stated in

chief that at about 9-00 AM the chiefs of three

services aS well as the BDR chief and the IGP of

Police were brought by Major Dalim at Studio No.2

and their statements of allegiance in favour of the

change were recorded and broadcast. On behalf of

Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid it was

suggested to Major General Shafiullah (PW 45) that

there was a successful military insurrection in the

morming of 15th August, 1975 and in the said

insurrection Khondker Mustaque Ahmed assumed

the power of President, that all the chiefs of the

defence services expressed their allegiance and that

he did not take any action against the persons

involved in the incident and that Khandaker

Mustague declared the killers as ‘7 a1”. In reply

to a question on behalf of Farook Rahman, Colonel

Shafayet Jamil (PW 44) stated that it was not

possible to take any action against the killers of 15th

August as the persons involved in the killing of 15th

August were given protection by the subsequent

Governments and favoured them and that the

conspirators and killers of 15th August used to stay

at Bangabhaban and that they run the Mustaque

Government by constituting a Revolutionary

Council.



67. By the above suggestions as given to the

witnesses the appellants termed the incident as a

successful military coup d’etat and that the Govern-

ments protected and rewarded them by declaring

them as ‘Surya Santan’ and the appellants did not try

to make out a case of mutiny and further they, in

their statements under section 342, were conspi-

cuously silent on this point and they changed their

stand at the appellate stage in the High Court

Division although there is no material in support of

the plea. Though in the Army Act, 1952, the defi-

nition of mutiny has not been given but the

punishment for the mutiny has been provided in

section 31 of the Army Act 1952. Mutiny has been

defined in section 35 of the Navy Ordinance, 1961,

which reads thus :



35. In this Ordinance, mutiny means a

combination between two or more persons

subject to service law, or between persons two

at least of whom are subject to service law—



(a) to overthrow or resist lawful authority

in the armed forces of Bangladesh or any forces

co-operating therewith or in any part of any of

the said forces;



(b) to disobey such authority in such cir-

cumstances as to make the disobedience sub-

versive of discipline, or with the object of

avoiding any duty or service, or in connection

with operations against the enemy; or



(c) to impede the performance of any duty

or service in the armed forces of Bangladesh or

in any forces co-operating therewith, or in any

part of any of the said forces.”



There is no dispute that this definition of

mutiny is applicable in the Army Act, 1952 in view

of the definition of ‘service law’ given in section

4(xxxiv), of the Navy Ordinance, 1961 which

provides that “service law” means this Ordinance,

the Army Act, 1952, the Air Force Act, 1953, and the

rules and regulations made thereunder.



68. The expression ‘active service’ used in

section 59 of the Army Act 1952, Khan Saifur Rah-

man submits, as is not applicable in this case but the



            
above submission is contradictory because the

appellants are trying to oust the jurisdiction of the

criminal Court relying upon some provisions of the

Amny Act 1952.

this definition of

in section 35 of Navy Ordinance

long with section 31 of the

he conclusion that



69. According to Mr Huq,



mutiny as given

1961 should be read a

Army Act 1952 for coming tot $101

the acts of the appellants do not come within the

mischief of mutiny. Clause (a) of section 31 speaks

of overthrowing or resisting lawful authority of the



armed forces of Bangladesh but there is nothing on

record to show that the appellants and other accused

insubordinated or collectively



have collectively

authority or refused to



defied or disregarded the fust

obey authority in order to bring their act within the



ambit of mutiny and further, the evidence on record

proved that the authority rather accepted the action

of the appellants and other accuseds, some disgrun-

tled army personnel and retired army officer, and

some of them were rewarded by the Government.



70. As it appears section 59(1) of the Army

Act 1952 provides that subject to the provisions of

sub-section (2), any person subject to the Army Act

who at any place commits a civil offence shall be

deemed to be guilty of an offence under the Army

Act and “Civil offence’ defined in section 8(2) Army

Act means an offence which, if committed in Bangla-

desh, would be triable by a criminal Court. There-

fore, there is no dispute that if the acts of the

appellants come within the mischief of ‘civil

offence’ there is no legal bar for the trial of the

appellants by a criminal Court constituted under the

Code however, section 59(2) of the Army Act

stipulates that person who is subject to Army Act

commits murder against any person not subject to

the Army Act shall not be liable to prosecution

under the Army Act unless he commits the offence

while on active service.



71. The term ‘active service’ has been

defined in section 8(1) as under:



“active service”, as applied to a person

subject to this Act, means the time during which

such person is attached to, or forms part of a

force which is engaged in operations against an

enemy, or is engaged in military operations in,



vs STATE (Md Tafa Islam J



on the line of march to a country or place

wholly or partly occupied by an enemy, or

attached to or forms part of a force which is in military occupation of a foreign country:



or



There is no allegation against the appel-

accused persons to the effect that

while they were in “active service” committed the

offence of murder and the appellants also did not

claim that the incident was committed while they

were on “active service”. There is also no material

on record to show that the incident was committed

while the appellants were engaged in operation

against an enemy OF that they were engaged in

military operation or on the line of march to a

country or place wholly or partly occupied by an

enemy.

73.  In terms of the relevant provisions of law

as above, if the appellants being not in ‘active

service’ commit a ‘civil offence’, the provisions of

Army Act does not stand on the way for their trial by

a criminal Court. Further sections 94 and 95 have

also been included in chapter IX of the Army Act

1952 for trial of ‘civil offence’ by an ordinary

criminal Court. Section 94 presupposes that both a

criminal Court and Court Martial have jurisdiction

concurrently in respect of an act or omission punish-

able both under the Army Act or in case of an

offence deemed to be an offence under the Army Act

as well as under any law in force and the same will

also be under scheme of those two provisions, in the

first instance, it is left to the discretion of the

prescribed officer to decide before which Court the

proceedings shall be instituted and, if the prescribed

officer decides that the case should be instituted

before a Court Martial, the offender is to be detained

in military ‘custody. However, at the same time if a

criminal Court is of opinion that the said offence

shall be tried before the said Court, he may issue

notice under section 95 either to deliver over the

offender to the nearest Magistrate or to postpone the

proceedings pending a reference to the Government

and upon receipt of the requisition the prescribed

officer may either deliver over the offender to the

said Court or refer the question to the Government

for determination as to whose order shall be final.



74. [am also in agreement with the submis-

sion of Mr Tawfique Nawaz that in view of the position



            
 of the then President as provided in the Cons.

jitution, merely because of one single Act i.e. Army

Act 1952, and for being “commander in chief” the

late president cannot be regarded as army personnel,



75. The learned Counsels for the appellants

also contended that in view of section 139 of the

penal Code and section 549 of the Code of Criminal

procedure the trial of the appellants by a criminal

Court 1st barred.



16. Section 139 of the Penal Code is inclu-

ded in chapter VII Which contains sections 131-140.

it appears section 131 provides for abetting

mutiny OF attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or

airman from his duty, section 132 provides for abet-

ment of mutiny, if mutiny is committed in conse-

quence thereot and other Sections are relating to

abetment of other offences and section 139 prohibits

unishment of any person under the provisions of

penal Code who is subject to the Army Act, 1952,

the Navy Ordinance, 1961, the Air Force Act 1953

for any of the offences or the abetment of those

offences mentioned in sections 131 to 138. Thus

section 139 of the Penal Code has no application in

the present appeals in view of the fact that the

appellants have been tried and convicted not for

committing an offence of abetment of mutiny but for

substantive offences of criminal conspiracy and

murder. Regarding section 549 of the Code, it

appears that it is of a special nature and has the

result of taking away the jurisdiction of criminal

Court with respect to persons subject to military,

naval and air force law. The expressions “‘is liable to

be tried either by a Court to which this Code applies

or by a Court Martial” used in this section implies

that the offence for which the offender is to be tried

should be an offence of which cognizance can be

taken by a Criminal Court as well as a Court Mar-

tial. The phrase is intended to refer to the initial

jurisdiction of the two Courts to take cognizance of

the offence and not to their jurisdiction to decide it

on merits. In respect of offences which could be

tried by both the Criminal Court as well as a Court

Martial, sections 94 and 95 of the Army Act have

made suitable provisions to avoid a conflict of



jurisdiction between those two Courts as discussed

above.



77. It may be mentioned here that sections

125 and 126 of the Army Act 1950 as applicable to



MAJOR BAZLUL Hupa vg State (Md Tafeezl Islam J) 27



India and sections 94 and 95 of the Army Act, 1952

are in verbatim language.



78. In Balbir Singh vs State of Punjab

(1995) 1 SCC 90 the Supreme Court of India obser-

ved:



“When a criminal Court and Court Martial

each have jurisdiction in respect of the trial of

the offence, it shall be in the discretion of the

officer commanding the group, wing or station

in which the accused is serving or such other

officer as may be prescribed, in the first

instance, to decide before which Court the pro-

ceedings shall be instituted and if that officer

decides that they should be instituted before a

“Court Martial”, to direct that the accused

persons shall be detained in Air Force custody.

Thus, the option to try a person subject to the

Air Force Act who commits an offence while on

“active service” is in the first instance with the

Air Force Authorities. The criminal Court,

when such an accused is brought before it shall

not proceed to try such a person or to inquire

with a view to his commitment for trial and

shall give a notice to the Commanding Officer

of the accused, to decide whether they would

like to try the accused by a Court Martial or

allow the criminal Court to proceed with the

trial. In case, the Air Force Authorities decide

either not to try such a person by a Court

Martial or fail to exercise the option when

intimated by a criminal Court within the period

prescribed by Rule 4 of the 1952 Rules, the

accused can be tried by the ordinary criminal

Court in accordance with the Code of Criminal

Procedure.”



79. In Joginder Singh vs State of Himachal

Pradesh, AIR 1971 SC 500, the Supreme Court

observed:



“It is further clear that in respect of an

offence which could be tried both by a criminal

Court as well as a Court Martial, sections 125,

126 and the Rules have made suitable provi-

sions to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction between

the ordinary criminal Courts and the Court

Martial, But it is to be noted that in the first

instance, discretion is left to the officer men-

tioned in section 125 to decide before which



            
 Court the proceedings should be instituted.

Hence the officer commanding the army, army

corps, division or independent brigade in which

the accused person is serving or such other

officer as may be prescribed will have to

exercise his discretion and decide under section

125 in which Court the proceedings shall be

instituted. It is only when he so exercises his

discretion and decides that the proceeding

should be instituted before a Court Martial, that

the provisions of section 126(1) come into

operation. If the designated officer does not

exercise his discretion and decides that the pro-

ceedings should be instituted before a Court

Martial, the Army Act would not obviously be

in the way of a criminal Court exercising its

ordinary jurisdiction in the manner provided by

law.”



80. In the case of Major EG Barsay vs State

of Bombay, AIR 1961 SC 1762 it was observed by

Subha Rao, J as follows:



“The scheme of the Act therefore is self-

evident. It applies to offences committed by

army personnel described in section 2 of the

Act; it creates new offences with specified

punishments, imposes higher punishments to

preexisting offences, and enables civil offences

by a fiction to be treated as offence under the

Act; it provides satisfactory machinery for

resolving the conflict of jurisdiction. Further it

enables, subject to certain conditions an

accused to be tried successively both by Court

Martial and by a criminal Court. It does not

expressly bar the jurisdiction of criminal Courts

in respect of acts or omissions punishable under

the Act, if they are also punishable under any

other law in force in India; nor is it possible to

infer any prohibition by necessary implication,

Sections 125, 126 and 127 exclude any such

inference, they, in express terms, provide not

only for resolving conflict of jurisdiction bet-

ween a criminal Court.and a Court Martial in

respect of a same offence, but also provide for

successive trials of an accused in respect of the

same offence.”



81. In the case of Jamil Huq relied on by the

appellants, the writ petitioners were tried and

convicted by the Court Martial under the Army Act

1952 for the offence of mutiny that took place in the

night following 29th March, 1981 which resulted in

the death of Ziaur Rahman, the then President of

Bangladesh. They filed writ petitions challenging

the decision of the Court Martial constituted under,

the Army Act. The High Court summarily rejected

the writ petitions. The Appellate Division in the

facts of the given case observed “if the Court Mar-

tial is constituted properly and the offence commit-

ted is cognizable by it then the rest is a question of

fact based on evidence which is held by all the

authorities that the writ jurisdiction is not available

to interfere. This Court is only concerned to

examine the question whether the jurisdiction under

Article 102 has been conferred and once it comes to

the conclusion that the jurisdiction has not been

conferred there is the end of the matter.”



82. As it appears, this case has no manner of

application in the facts and circumstances of the

instant case.



83. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the learned

Counsel for the appellant Bazlul Huda, however

referred the case of RV Grant, Davis Riley and

Topley, (1957) 2 All ER 694.



84. As it appears, in the above case, the

appellants were convicted by a General Court Mar-

tial held at Nicosia in Cyprus of the offences of

mutiny. On the night of the incident a noisy outbreak

took place in the barracks—the appellants held a

meeting on the roof of the hotel at which they were

stationed, then came down and acted in riotous

conduct and demolished the barrack’s shop as their

grievances made to the authority were not redressed.

They received an order from a Warrant Officer to

disperse but they did not disperse. The House of

Lords refused to interfere with their conviction on

the reasonings as under:



“I have not thought it necessary to take up

time by going through the evidence in detail.

The Court is quite satisfied that there was

evidence on which the Court Martial could find

on a proper direction that there was a mutiny,

and it is not for us to criticize the finding

provided there was evidence on which they

could come to the decision they did. For the



            
reasons which I have endeavoured to state as

shortly as 1 can, the Court is of opinion that

there was no misdirection; that, although per-

haps criticism could be made of the words the

Judge-Advocate used when he made his

interlocutory observation, there was a perfectly

fair direction and nothing was said by the

Judge-Advocate which could have misled the

Court Martial. Therefore, on all these grounds

the appeals should, we think, be dismissed,”



85. As it appears in the instant appeals there

is nothing on record to show that the army authority

have initiated any proceeding against the appellants

and other accused persons under the Army Act for

violating the direction of the authority. There is also

no evidence that there was collective insubordina-

tion when they committed the killing, The accused

persons were not in ‘active service’ and they have

not committed a civil offence within the meaning of

section §(2) of the Army Act. Therefore, the cri-

minal Court has not acted in excess of jurisdiction in

convicting the appellants.



86. It also appears that in order to avoid con-

troversy, the leamed Sessions Judge was accorded

sanction from the prescribed authority for trial of the

appellants and other accused persons although they

have committed no offence under the Army Act.

Therefore, I find no substance in the objection raised

by the learned Counsels for the appellants regarding

the forum of trial.



87. Before discussing the fourth and fifth

grounds i.e. conspiracy and murder, the question as

to whether the confessions made by the appellants

Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin

(Artillery) are legally admissible in evidence are to

be addressed because if those confessional state-

ments are legally admissible in evidence, the state-

ment made therein will be relevant for disposing

both the grounds of conspiracy as well as murder

and if those are found to be not legally admissible,



the prosecution wil] have to prove both the grounds

on the basis of other evidence on record,



88. Regarding the confessional statements of

the appellants Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and

Mohiuddin (Artillery), the learned Counsel for the

appellants submitted those were procured by torture

and coercion by the police by keeping them on

police remand for a long time and therefore, those

were not voluntary as would be evident from the

reasonings and findings given by first learned Judge

and the second learned Judges erred in law in

accepting these confessions as voluntary and the

Third learned Judge also erred in accepting the

confession of Mohiuddin (Artillery). It was further

urged that since the learned Judges of the Division

Bench were equally divided in their opinion as

regards the confessional statements of Sultan Shah-

riar, Farook Rahman, the Third learned Judge ought

to have considered their confessional statements

also.



89. Mr Anisul Huq and the learned Attorney-

General, on the other hand, submitted that the first

learned Judge not only misread the materials on

record, but on misconception of law disbelieved the

above confessional statements on the grounds that

before recording the statements the confessing

accuseds were kept in police remand beyond period

as provided in section 167(2) of the Code of Crimi-

nal Procedure by a “device”. The learned Attorney-

General drew our attention to the statement of PW

61 and submitted that the appellant Farook Rahman

was taken on police remand for 13 days on two

occasions in Lalbagh PS Case No.11(11)75 before

the institution of the instant case on 2nd October

1996, and Sultan Shahrior was also taken on 15 days

remand on three occasions in the said case before he

was shown arrested in the instant case on 3rd

October 1996 and accordingly, findings of the first

learned Judge that the confessional statement of

Farook Rahman was in fact, recorded after keeping

him on police remand for 32 days and likewise the

confessional statement of Shahriar was recorded

after keeping him on police remand for 34 days are

not correct.



90. Records show that Sultan Shahriar was

shown arrested in the instant case on 3rd October,

1996 and he was taken on police remand for 7 days

on 30th November, 1996 and then his confessional

statement was recorded and that Farook Rahman

was shown arrested on 3rd October, 1996 in the

instant case and thereafter he was taken on police

remand for 7 days on 12th December, 1996 and then

his confessional statement was recorded on 19th



            
December, 1996 and that Mohiuddin (artillery) was

taken on police remand for 7 days on 19th Novem-

ber, 1996 and thereafter he made his confessional

statement on 27th November, 1996.



91. PW SI stated that he recorded the con-

fession of Sultan Shahriar after compliance of

formalities required under section 364 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure and explained to the accused

about the contents of his statement and that after

recording statement he issued a certificate about the

correctness of the statement. As it appears appellant

Sultan Shahriar did not challenge this statement of

this witness that he did record his statement in

accordance with section 364 of the Code. PW 51

however admitted that there was no comment in

column No.S of the Form and he gave an explana-

tion that as the accused did not complain to him of

any il] treatment he did not fill up the above column

and this witness denied the defence suggestion that

he recorded the statement of the accused under

duress and torture and that the accused was kept in

wrongful confinement in police custody or that the

statement recorded was not read over to the accused

and that it was not voluntary. PW 51 also stated that



e recorded the statement of Farook Rahman after

compliance of the formalities required under section

364 of the Code and that after recording his

confession the accused was sent to the Court of

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and the CMM

acknowledged the receipt of the accused on the

same day and that he issued a certificate to the above

effect. Farook Rahman the confessing accused, did

not challenge this claim made by this witness

regarding the recording of his confessional state-

ment in accordance with the provisions required by

law. PW 51 denied the defence suggestion that at the

time of recording his statement an ASP of CID the

investigating officer and other police officers were

present in his room. PW 51 however admitted that

he did not fill up columns 3, 4, 8 and 10 of the Form

but denied the defence suggestion that Faruque

Rahman reported to him about police torture.



92. PW S2 stated that at the time of recor-

ding confession of Mohiuddin (Artillery) he fol-

lowed the procedures provided in section 364 of the

Code and thereafter he issued a certificate and that

after recording his confession, the accused was sent

to jail custody. Mohiuddin (Artillery) also dig Ney

challenge the claim of this witness about FeCordin,

his statement in accordance with the procedure laiq

down by law. PW 52 however, admitted that 1p,

Column No.1 of the Form was blank pw 52

however denied the defence suggestion that Mofy.

uddin (Artillery)did not make any confession to him

or that he signed a statement being prepared by th.

investigating officer or that the signature of thi,

accused was obtained by force in presence of the

police and that the confessional statements were nos

true or voluntary. As it appears in column No.1 o¢

the Form it was mentioned by PW 52 that the Moki.

uddin was produced at 11-00 AM on 271

November, 1996 and his statement was recorded a1

2-00 PM. So the time as well as date of producing

the accused and the time of recording his statement

were duly mentioned. Column Nos. 3 and 4 of the

Form are the instructions and guidelines given to the

Magistrates to follow while recording confessional

statement of an accused. Column No.3 relates to

explaining to the confessing accused each of the

matters mentioned in column 5 and to caution him

to reflect carefully before making the statement.

However, as it appears, the queries required to

confront the accused in column 5 had duly been

confronted in Column No. 6. The above columns

were duly filled up and so the accused should not

have any grievance in this regard. The defence

suggestion that at the time of recording statement

any police officer was present in his room was

denied Column 8 relates to brief statement of

Magistrate’s reasoning about his satisfaction that the

statement was voluntary. The concerned Magistrate

in his statement stated that the confessional

statement was recorded in accordance with law and

that the accused being satisfied of the correctness of

the statement put his signature. Column 10 contains

the time of forwarding the accused after recording

confession. The concerned Magistrate stated that

after recording statement he forwarded the accused

to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on the same



day with the record.



93. As it appears the object of putting ques-

tions to an accused who offers to confess is to obtain

an assurance of the fact that the confession is not

caused by any inducement, threat or promise having

reference to the charge against him.



            
94. Chapter XLV of the Code of Criminal

Procedure deals generally with the irregular

proceedings. There are certain irregularities which

do not vitiate the proceedings and these are set out

in section 529, No question of prejudice arises in

this class of cases because the section states cate-

gorically that they shall not vitiate the proceedings.

Certain other irregularities are treated as vital and



there the proceedings are void irrespective of



prejudice. These are set out in section 530. A Third

class is dealt with in sections $31, 532, 533, 535,

§36(2) and $37. There broadly speaking the ques-

tion is, Whether the error has caused prejudice to the

accused or has occasioned a failure of justice. The

Code has carefully classified certain kinds of error

and expressly indicates how they have to be dealt

with. In every such case the Court is bound to give

effect to the express commands of the legislature,

there is no scope for further speculation. The only

class of case in which the Courts are free to reach a

decision is that for which no express provision is

made.



95. In the instant particular case only section

533 of the Code is to be considered. The first lear-

ned Judge has mentioned section 537 of the Code in

this regard which has no manner of application in

respect of any error or omission or irregularities that

occurred while recording confessional statement by

Magistrate.



96. Section 533 reads as follows:



“533. Non-compliance with provisions of

section 164 or 364(1)—If any Court, before

which a confession or other statement of an

accused person recorded or purporting to be

recorded under section 164 or section 364 is

tendered or has been received in evidence, finds

that any of the provisions of either of such

sections have not been complied with by the

Magistrate recording the statement, it shall take

evidence that such person duly made the

statement recorded; and, notwithstanding any-

thing contained in the Evidence Act, 1872,

section 91, such statement shall be admitted if

the error has not injured the accused as to his

defence on the merits.



(2) The provisions of this section apply to

Courts of Appeal, Reference and Revision.”



97. ‘This section provides a mode for the

rectification of an error arising from noncompliance

with any of the provisions of section 164 or section

364, The object is to prevent justice being frustrated

by reason of such non-compliance, If any of the

provisions of this section have not been complied

with by a Magistrate, the confessional statement

may be admitted under this section upon taking

evidence that the statement recorded was duly made,

if non-compliance has not injured the accused to his

defence on the merit. If the record of the confession

or the statement is inadmissible owing to the failure

to comply with any of the provisions of section 164

or section 364, intrinsic evidence, notwithstanding

anything in section 91 of the Evidence Act, may be

given to show that the accused person duly made the

statement and the statement, when so proved may be

admitted and used as evidence of the case, if non-

compliance has not injured the accused. The non-

compliance with the provisions is cured only when

there is no injury caused to the accused as to his

defence on merit.



98. This view has been expressed in Moham-

mad Ali vs Emperor, 35 CrLJ 385 (FB) as follows:



“In view of the provisions of the sections

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, particularly

those contained in section 533, Criminal Pro-

cedure Code, it is difficult to say that the

omission to record questions and answers is a

fatal defect, and that it is only by recording such

questions and answers that a confession can

furnish data which enable the Court to arrive at

the conclusion as to the voluntary nature of the

confession. It is equally difficult to hold that

when supplying these data or materials it would

always be “impossible” for the trial Court to

form an estimate as to the voluntary nature of

such confession. The defect no doubt is a gross

irregularity and it may in certain special cases

injure the accused in his defence on the merits,

but barring such cases such a defect is

completely cured by the provisions of section

533 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is



            
 open to a Court to come to a conclusion from

the internal evidence furnished by the statement

itself or from other evidence that the statement

had been voluntarily made, and the mere fact

that there was an omission to record questions

and answers would not debar the Court from

coming to that conclusion. Nor can it be said

that without these data or materials it is “impos-

sible” for a Court to arrive at the conclusion that

the confession had been made voluntarily.

Where, of course, the defect is not merely one

of recording it in due form and in accordance

with law but there is a defect that the statement

was not duly made at all, the position would be

different.”



99. However in Kehar Singh’ case (AIR

]988 SC 1883) a question arose about the defect in

the procedure in recording the confession of Kehar

Singh wherein it was observed as follows:



“On a consideration of the above decisions



it is manifest that if the provisions of section

164(2) which require that the Magistrate before

recording confession shall explain to the person

making confession that he is not bound to make

a confession and if he does so it may be used as

evidence against him and upon questioning the

person if the Magistrate has reasons to believe

that it is being made voluntarily then the con-

fession will be recorded by the Magistrate. The

compliance of the sub-section (2) of section 164

is therefore, mandatory and imperative and

non-compliance of it renders the confession

inadmissible in evidence. Section 463 (old

section 533 ) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

provides that where the questions and answers

regarding the confession have not been

recorded evidence can be adduced to prove that

in fact, the requirements of sub-section (2) of

section 164 read with section 28] (old section

364) have been complied with. If the Court

comes to a finding that such a compliance had

in fact, been made the mere omission to record

the same in the proper form will not render it

inadmissible evidence and the defect is cured

under section 463 but when there is no-com-

pliance of the mandatory requirement of section

164(2), Criminal Procedure Code and it comes

out in evidence that no such explanation as

envisaged in the aforesaid sub-section has been

given to the accused by the Magistrate, this

substantial defect cannot be cured under section



463 Criminal Procedure Code.”



100. However as it appears the first learned

Judge taking into consideration the successive

remands of the appellants and the alleged non com-

pliance of provisions of law, did not accept the

confessional statements holding that taking the

appellants on remand in connection with other cases

without following proper procedure was a “device™

adopted by the prosecution for obtaining the above

confessional statements. From the record, it further

appears that Sultan Shahriar retracted his confession

on Sth February, 1997 after 52 days of his confes-

sion, Farook Rahman retracted his confession on Ist

March, 1993 after 43 days of his confession and

Mohiuddin (artillery) retracted his confession after a

long time more than 30 days of his confession.

There being no explanation on the side of defence

about the delay in filing the applications for

retractions, it can be inferred that the retracting of

these appellants are afterthought devices for nulli-

fying the admissions made in the statements.



101. Regarding the effect of retraction of a

confessional statement, in the case of Joygan Bibi

12 DLR (SC)157, the Supreme Court of Pakistan

observed :



“We are unable to support the proposition

of law laid down by the learned Judges in this

regard. The retraction of a confession is a cir-

cumstance which has no bearing whatsoever

upon the question whether in the first instance it

was voluntarily made, and on the further

question whether it is true. The fact that the

maker of the confession later does not adhere to

it cannot by itself have any effect upon the

findings reached as to whether the confession

was voluntary, and if so, whether it was true, for

to withdraw from a self-accusing statement in

direct face of the consequence of the accusa-

tion, is explicable fully by the proximity of

those consequences, and need have no con-

nection whatsoever with either its voluntary

nature, or the truth of the facts stated. The

learned Judges were perfectly right in first



            
deceding these two questions, and the answers

being in  the affirmative, in declaring that the

confession by itself was sufficient, taken with other facts and circumstances, to support

Abdul Majid’s conviction. The retraction of the

confession was wholly immaterial once it Was

and that it was voluntary as well as true, That

being the case, no reason Whatsoever can be

found for the inability felt by the learned Judges

is taking the confession into consideration

“against the co-accused. It is true that if there

were no other evidence against Joygun Bibi

except the confession of Abdul Majid, then, the

confession by itself being merely a matter to be

taken into consideration, and not having the

yality of evidence against Joygun Bibi, it

could rightly be held in law that her conviction

could not be sustained on the confession alone,

The grounds for this conclusion would undoub-

tedly gain weight if the confession were also

retracted. But in the present case, Abdul Majid’s

confession is by no means the only material in

the case to be taken into consideration against

Joygun Bibi. As will be seen presently, the

evidence of the maid-servant Zohura furnished

a very complete and detailed account of the

movements and behaviour of Joygun Bibi on

the night in question, and particularly at and

after the time of the murder. Joygun Bibi has

not offered any explanation in answer to the

questions put to her on the basis of Zohura’s

evidence and Abdul Majid’s confession as to

her behaviour that night. She has been content

to repeat that she is innocent and to suggest that

the case has been fabricated against her by her

husband’s younger brother, Sattar.”



DLR (SC) 598 similar views have been expressed as

follows:



“As for the confessions the High Court, it

appears, was duly conscious of the fact that

retracted confessions, whether judicial or extra-

judicial, could legally be taken into considera-

tion against the maker of those confessions

himself, and if the confessions were found to be

true and voluntary, then there was no need at all

to look for further corroboration. It is now well

Settled that as against the maker himself his



S STATE (Md Tafezzul Islam J)



33

confession, judicial Or extr

retracted or not retr

form the sole basis

Court is satisfied

and Voluntary



a-judicial, Whether

acted, can in law Validly

of his conviction, if the

and believes that it Was true



and was not obtained by torture

OF Coercion or inducement, The question, how-

ever, as to whether in the facts and circum-

stances of a given case the Court should act

upon such a confession alone is an entirely



different question, which relates to the weight



and evidentiary value of the confession and not

to its admissibility in law.”



103. Similar views have been expressed in

Mohd. Hussain Umar vs KS Dalipsinghhi, AIR 1970

SC 45, Ram Prakash ys State of Punjab AIR 1959

SCI, and State vs Fazy Kazi alias Kazi Fazlur

Rahman 29 DLR (SC) 271.



104. As to the weight of confessional state-

ment, the view of the superior Courts is that a

confession can be made foundation of a conviction

if it is recorded in accordance with law, found true

and voluntary, inculpatory in nature and if on exami-

nation of the statement as a whole if it is found in

conformity on comparison with the rest of the prose-

cution case. What amount of corroboration could be

necessary in a case would always be a question of

fact to be determined in the light of the circum-

stances of each case. Sometimes no corroborative

evidence are available and the Court can act upon

the confession whether retracted or not, against the

maker, if the confession is found to be true and

voluntary and if it was not obtained by torture,

coercion or inducement. The proper way to

approach a case of this kind is, first to marshall the

evidence against the accused excluding the confes-

sion altogether from consideration and see whether,

if it is believed, a conviction could be based on it. If

it is capable of belief independently, then, of course,

it is not necessary to call the confession in aid.

Where the Court is not prepared to act on the other

evidence, in such an event the Judge may call in aid

the confession and use it to lend assurance to the

other evidence.



105. As it appears the confessional statement

of Sultan Shahriar is about his presence in front of

Sherniabat’s house and then at the Radio Station 1st

corroborated by other two confessional statements



            


of Syed Farook Rahman and Mohiuddin (artillery).

His statement as regards his subsequent conduct has

been corroborated by PWs 15, 42 and 46. The con-

fessional statement of Farook Rahman has been

corroborated by the other two confessional state-

ments of Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (artillery).

PWs 1, 4, 11, 12, 15, 21, 42 and 46 corroborated his

statement in material particulars. The confession of

Mohiuddin (artillery) is corroborated by other con-

fessing accuseds in material particulars. His

statement has also been corroborated by PWs 17,

18, 27 and 34, His statement as regards his presence

at the night parade has been corroborated by PWs

11, 21, 22, 24, 25, 29 and 35.



106. Next question is, whether under section

10 of the Evidence Act the above confessional state-

ments even if found to be true and voluntary are

admissible in evidence against the makers and also

each of the appellants as co-conspirators to prove

the charge of criminal conspiracy after the cessation

of the conspiracy?



107. As it appears section 10 of the Evidence

Act will come into play only when the Court is

satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe

that two or more persons have conspired together to

commit an offence or an actionable wrong, that is to

say, there should be a prima facie evidence that a

person was a party to be conspiracy before his act

can be used against his conspirators. Once such a

reasonable ground exists, anything said, done or

written by one of the conspirators in reference to the

common intention, after the said intention was

entertained, is relevant against others, not only for

the purpose of proving the existence of the cons-

piracy but also for proving that the other person was

a party to it. The evidentiary value of the said act is

limited by two circumstances, namely, that the act

shall be in reference to their common intention and

in respect of a period after such period was enter-

tained by any one of them.



108. Conspiracy means something more than

the joint action of two or more persons to commit an

offence; if it were otherwise, section 10 would be

applicable to any of the offences committed by two

or more persons Jointly and would thus import into

a trial of hearsay evidence which the accused person

would find it impossible to meet. The section is



intended to admit evidence of communications

between different conspirators while the conspiracy

was going on, with reference to the carrying out of

the conspiracy. Now the question Is, whether section

10 is capable of being widely construed SO as to

include a confession made by a conspirator with

reference to past acts done in the actual course of

carrying out the conspiracy after it has been

completed.



109. Inthe case of Emperor of India vs Abani

Bhusan Chakrabutty, 15 CWN 25, question arose

whether confessions of co-accuseds is a relevant

fact under section 10 of the Evidence Act. In the

above decision the Full Bench observed as follows:



“ The first piece of evidence we referred a

short time ago. It is argued, on behalf of the



Crown, that statement comes within the provi-



sions of section 10 the Indian Evidence Act, and



is therefore to be treated as evidence against



Abani’s fellow-prisoners. It is said that, if it



does not fall within section 10, at any rate,



under the provisions of section 30, it is a



confession of one of the co-accused and may be



referred to in the course of the trial. It is argued

by Mr Roy with very considerable force, that, in

any case, its value can be no higher than that of

the evidence of an accomplice, and that, indeed,

it is of less value than the evidence of an

accomplice, because an accomplice can be

cross-examined for the purpose of testing his

accuracy, while this confession of Abani made

when he was a prisoner cannot be subject to that

test. There is, of course, very great force in that

argument we have come to the conclusion that

the statement of Abani cannot properly be

treated as evidence under section 10 of the



Evidence Act, that section, in our view, 1s



intended to make evidence communications



between different conspirators while the

conspiracy is going on, with reference to the

carrying out of the conspiracy. No doubt section



10 is wider than the law of England as '0



evidence in case of conspiracy. But we do not



think that section is intended to make evidenence

the confession of a co-accused and put it on the

same footing as a communication passing

between conspirators, or between conspiration

and other persons. with reference to the



            
conspiracy. But, with regard to section 30, in

our opinion the statement, being the confession

of a co-accused, can be looked at under that

section. But its value is discounted by the fact

that it cannot be tested by cross-examination,



110. putting it any higher than the statement of an

accomplice, nor can we in any way allow ourselves

to be influenced by the statements in it, except

where those statements are corroborated by inde-

ondent testimony implicating the accused persons

in the design with which they are charged.”



111. This point was then considered within

Mirza Akbar vs King Emperor, AIR 1940 (PC) 176.

Their Lordships of the Privy Council on conside-

ration of different authorities and section 10 of the

Evidence Act observed as follows:



“This being the principle, their Lordships

think the words of section 10 must be construed

in accordance with it and are not capable of

being widely construed so as to include a state-

ment made by one conspirator in the absence of

the other with reference to past acts done in the

actual course of carrying out the conspiracy,

after it has been completed. The common

intention is in the past. In their Lordships’ judg-

ment, the words “common intention” signifies a

common intention existing at the time when the



thing was said, done or written by one of them.

Things said, done or written while the conspi-

racy was on foot are relevant as evidence of the

common intention, once reasonable ground has

been shown to believe in its existence. But it

would be a very different matter to hold that

any narrative or statement or confession made

to a Third party after the common intention or

conspiracy was no longer operating and had

ceased to exist is admissible against the other

party. There is then no common intention of the

conspirators to which the statement can have

reference. In their Lordships’ judgment section

10 embodies this principle. That is the

construction which has been rightly applied to

section 10 in decisions in India, for instance, in

55 Bom 839 and 38 Cal 169. In these cases the

distinction was rightly drawn between commu-

nications between conspirators while the cons-

We do not think, for a moment, of



conspiracy was going on with reference to the carry-

ing out of conspiracy and statements made,

after arrest or after the conspiracy has ended, by

way of description of events then past.”



112. As it appears the expression ‘in refer-

ence to their common intention’ is very comprehen-

sive and, it appears to have been designedly used to

give a wider scope than the words ‘in furtherance of

the common intention’ used in section 34 of the

Penal Code with the result, anything said, done or

written by a co-conspirator, after the conspiracy was

formed, will be evidence against the other before he

entered the field of conspiracy or after he left it.



113. On analysing section 10, it has been

observed in Bhagwan Swarup vs State of Maha-

rashtra, AIR 1965 SC 682 as under:



“Anything so said, done or written is a rele-

vant fact only “as against each of the persons

believed to be so conspiring as well for the pur-

pose of proving the existence of the conspiracy

as for the purpose of showing that any such

person was a party to it”. It can only be used for

the purpose of proving the existence of the

conspiracy or that the other party or for the

purpose of showing that such a person was not

a party to the conspiracy. In short, the section

can be analysed as follows: (1) there shall be a

prima facie evidence affording a reasonable

ground for the Court to believe that two or more

persons are members of the conspiracy; (2) if

the said condition is fulfilled, anything said,

done or written by any one of them in reference

to their common intention will be evidence

against the other; (3) anything said, done or

written by him should have been said, done or

written by him after the intention was formed

by any one of them; (4) it would also be

relevant for the said purpose against another

who entered the conspiracy whether it was said,

done or written before he entered the conspi-

racy or after he left it; and (5) it can only be

used against a co-conspirator and not in his

favour.”



114. Similar views have been expressed in the

case of Zulfigar Ali Bhutto vs State PLD 1979 SC 53

and also in the case of State vs Nalini (1999) 5 SCC

283.In the case of Mogbool Hossain vs State, 12



            
DLR SC 217 the case against Moqbool Hussain rested entirely on what the other two accused were alleged to have stated to Tahsilder at the the time of offering the bride money to the Tahsilder for the purpose of mutating his name in the register. At the trail those two accused repudiated their alleged statements.



115. Section 10 of the Evidence Act declares

that where there is reasonable ground to band

two or more persons have conspired together to

commit an offence ’

said, done or written by any one of such persons In

reference to their common intention, after the time

when such intention was first entertained by any one

of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the

persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the

purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy

as for the purpose of showing that any such person

was 2 party to it. A plain reading of this section

makes it clear that apart from the act or statement of

the co-conspirator, some prima facie evidence must

exist of the antecedent conspiracy in order to attract

secon 10 Such evidence of a pre-existing cons-

piracy between the appellant and the two Revenue

Officers is conspicuous by its absence in this case.



116. Accordingly, once a reasonable ground

exists to believe that two or more persons have

conspired together to commit an offence, anything

said, done or written by one of the conspirators in

reference to the common intention after the common

intention was entertained, is relevant against the

other, not only for the purpose of proving the exis-

tence of the conspiracy but also for proving that the

other person was a party to it. There can be two

objections to the admissibility of evidence under

section 10 of the Evidence Act, Firstly, that the co-

nsplirator whose evidence is sought to be admitted

against the coconspirator is not confronted in Court

by the co-conspirator, and secondly, the prosecution

merely proves the existence of reasonable ground t

believe that two or more Persons have conspired I

commit an offence and that brings into operation the

But however statement made after the



been terminated on Achieving it

bandoned or it is frustrated or the

conspirator leaves the conspiracy " Mahi ig ner

admissible against the co-consp! '. IXINg the

period of conspiracy is important as PrOVisions

of section 10 of the Evidence Act would apply only

during the existence of the conspiracy.



117. But however statement made after the conspiracy has been terminated on achieving its object or it is abandoned or it is frustrated or the conspirator leaves the conspiracy in between, it is not admissible against the co-conspirator. Fixing the period of conspiracy is important as the provisions of Section 10 of the evidence Act would apply only during the existence of the conspiracy.



118. In view of the legal position QS Stated

above, it appears that the above confessional state-

ments of Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and

Mohiuddin (Artillery) are not relevant fact to prove

the charge of conspiracy framed against the appel-

lants. As stated earlier, the first learned Judge takin g

into consideration the successive remands of the

appellants by passing the provisions of law and non

compliance of provisions of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, did not accept the confessional state.

ments holding that taking the appellants on remand

in connection with other case and “showing the

appellants arrested” without following proper pro-

cedure which according to him was a “device”

adopted by the prosecution.



119. Now the question is, if the said confes-

sional statements are kept out of consideration

whether the evidence on record merely discloses a

case of conspiracy to commit mutiny to change the

then Government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman or a

conspiracy to commit murder of the President and

his family.



120. Before considering the above question

and also the fifth grounds i.e. charge of murder, the

scope of Article 103(3) of the Constitution is also to

be considered because to decide the above the

question of facts will invariably come in.



121. Article 103(3) is couched in the verbatim

language of Article 136 of the Constitution of India.



122. Besides various decisions of this Divi-

sion on this point, in the case of Hargun Sundar Das 

vs State of Maharashtra, AIR 1970 SC 1514 the

Supreme Court of India, while considering the scop¢

of its jurisdiction to assess the evidence in an appeal

ON conviction also observed as follows:



“We may appropriately repeat what ha

often been Pointed out by this Court under



            
Article 136 of the Constitution, this Court does

not normally proceed to review the evidence in

criminal cases unless the trial is Vitiated by

some illegality or material irregularity of

procedure or the trial is held in violation of

rules of natural justice resulting in unfairness to

the accused or the judgment or order under

appeal has resulted in grave miscarriage of

justice. This article reserves to this Court a

special discretionary power to interfere in

suitable cases when for special reasons it

considers that interference is called for in the

larger interest of justice,”



123. Similar views have been expressed in the

cases of Metro vs State of UP AIR 1971 SC 1050,

Subeder vs State of UP AIR 1971 SC 125, and Ram



Sanjiwan Singh vs State of Bihar, AIR 1996 SC

3265.



124. Regarding conspiracy, the learned Coun-

sels for the appellants argued, the evidence of Lieu-

tenant Colonel Abul Basher BA, PW 7, Lieutenant

Colonel (Retd) Abdul Hamid, PW 9, ALD Sirajul

relate to conspiracy to commit mutiny and existence

of criminal conspiracy to murder the President and



his family members is absent in the present appeals

but the leaned Judges illegally maintained the con-



viction of the appellants under section 120B of the

Penal Code.



125. On the other hand, Mr Anisul Huq sub-

mitted that there are sufficient evidence on record in

Support of the charge of criminal conspiracy to com-

mit the murder of the President and his family

members and further the defence having admitted

that there was criminal conspiracy to commit

mutiny and they failing to substantiate its plea, the

appellants could not escape from the charge of

Criminal conspiracy to commit murder, specially in

view of the admission of the appellants that they

have conspired to commit an offence, and the evi-

dence of LD Bashir Ahmed PW 11, ALD Sirajul

Munsur Ahmed PW 39, Honourary Lieutenant Syed

Ahmed, PW 40, Colonel Shafayet Jamil PW 44 and

Syed Siddiqur Rahman, Curator of Dhaka Museum

PW 53 proved the charge of criminal conspiracy to

commit murder of the President and his family

members and the learned Judges of the High Cout

Division committed no miscarriage of justice in

maintaining the charge of criminal conspiracy to

commit murder of the President and other members

of his family.



126. The elements of criminal conspiracy are

(a) an agreement between two or more persons, (b)

to do an illegal act, or (c) to do a legal act by illegal

means, and (d) an overt act done in pursuance of the

conspiracy. Further, in order to prove a charge of

criminal conspiracy for an offence under section

120B of the Penal Code, the prosecution need not

prove that the perpetrators expressly agreed to do or

caused to be done the illegal act; the agreement may

be proved even by necessary implication. In a

conspiracy, persons are often required to do various

acts at various stages and even if for the first time

they come into conspiracy at a latter stage they are

members of the conspiracy provided their act is

calculated to promote the object of the conspiracy. It

is no doubt true that the offence is complete as soon

as an agreement, is made between the conspirators

and in that case they would be punishable under

section 120B. The essence of the offence is the com-

bination of agreement express or implied, the actus

reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to commit an

offence, not execution of it. It is enough if it is

shown a meeting of minds, a consensus to affect an

unlawful purpose, It can be established by direct or

circumstantial evidence. Privacy and secrecy are

main characteristics of a conspiracy than of a loud

discussion in an elevated place open to public view.

It is not always possible to give direct evidence

about the date, place and time of the formation of

the conspiracy, about the persons that took part in its

formation, about the objects which they set before

themselves as the object of conspiracy and about. the

manner in which the object of conspiracy is to be



            
carried out—all these are matters of inference that

can be drawn from the facts of the case.



127. Under the common law, conspiracy con-

sists in an agreement between two or more persons

to achieve an unlawful object, unlawful being used

in a special sense here. The offence consists in the

combining. So long as such a design rests In

intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree

to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself.

The offence is, therefore, complete though no

further act is done in pursuance of the agreement

and, provided that if the stage of negotiations has

been passed, it will be a conspiracy even “where the

parties had not settled the means to be employed.” It

is not necessary that a person charged with conspi-

racy should also be an accomplice.



128. The English Law on this matter is well

settled. The following passage from Russell on Crime

(12th Edition Volume 1, 202) may be usefully noted:



“The gist of the offence of conspiracy then

lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the pur-

pose for which the conspiracy is formed, nor in

attempting to do them, nor in inciting others to

do them, but in the forming of the scheme or

agreement between the parties. Agreement is

essential. Mere knowledge, or even discussion,

of the plan is not, per se, enough.”



129. Glanville Williams in the “Criminal

Law” (Second Ed.382) explains the proposition

with an illustration:



“The question arose in an Lowa case, but it

was discussed in terms of conspiracy rather

than of accessoryship. D, who had grievance

against P told E that if he would whip P some-

one would pay his fine, F replied that he did not

want anyone to pay his fine, that he had a

grievance of his own against P and that he

would whip him at the first opportunity, E

whipped P. D was acquitted of conspiracy

because there was no agreement for “ concert of

action”, no agreement to “co-operate”,



130. He explained “Mere knowledge of and

mental consent to a crime about to be committed by

another does not make a mana conspirator, but quite

a slight participation in the plan will be sufficient,”



131. Coleridge, J. while summing up the Case

to Jury in Regina vs Murphy, (1837) 173 ER sq)



(508) pertinently states:



“Tam bound to tell you, that although th,

common design is the root of the charge, jx is

not necessary to prove that these two Parties

came together and actually agreed in terms to

have this common design and to pursue it by

common means, and so to carry it into execy.

tion. This is not necessary, because in many

cases of the most clearly established conspi-

racies there are no means of proving any such

thing, and neither law nor commonsense

requires that it should be proved. If you fing

that these two persons pursued by their acts the

same object, often by the same means, one per-

forming one part of an act, so as to complete it,

with a view to the attainment of the object

which they were pursuing, you will be at liberty

to draw the conclusion that they have been

engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object.

The question you have to ask yourselves is,

“Had they this common design, and did they

pursue it by these common means—the design

being unlawful ?”



132. It will be thus seen that the most import-

ant ingredient of the offence of conspiracy is the

agreement between two or more persons to do an

illegal act. The illegal act may or may nor be done

in pursuance of agreement, but the very agreement

is an offence and is punishable.



133. Reference to sections 120A and 120B of

the Penal Code which have brought the “Law of

Conspiracy” in the then India, will show that those

are in line with the English law by making the overt

act unessential when the conspiracy is to commit

any punishable offence and the provisions of section

120A would make these aspects clear beyond doubt.

Entering into an agreement by two or more persons

to do an illegal act or legal act by illegal means is the

very quintessence of the offence of conspiracy:

Section 10 also has a reference to section 120A of

the Penal Code which provides: “when two or more

Persons agree to do, or cause to be done, (a) an ille-

gal act, or (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal

means, such an agreement is designated a criminal

conspiracy.” A proviso has been added which



            
provides that no agreement except an agreement to

commit offence shall amount to conspiracy.

Therefore, it is apparent that a prima facie case of

racy has to be established for the application

conspiracy‘

of section 10 of the Evidence Act. There must be

reasonable ground to believe that two or more



persons have conspired together in the light of the

language of section 120A of the Penal Code. In

Kehar Singh vs State, AIR 1988 SC 1883 section

120A is explained in the following manner:



“This section mainly could be divided into

two: the first part talks of where there is reason-

able ground to believe that two or more persons

have conspired to commit an offence or an

actionable wrong, and it is only when this con-

dition precedent is satisfied that the subsequent

part of the section comes into operation and it is

material to note that this part of the section talks

of reasonable grounds to believe that two or

more persons have conspired together and this

evidently has reference to section 120A where it

is provided “When two or more persons agree

to do, or cause to be done”. This further has

been safeguarded by providing a proviso that no

agreement except an agreement to commit an

offence shall amount to criminal conspiracy. It

will be therefore necessary that a prima facie

case of conspiracy has to be established for

application of section 10. The second part of

section talks of anything said, done or written

by any one of such persons in reference to the

common intention after the time when such

intention was first entertained by any one of

them is relevant fact against each of the persons

believed to be so conspiring as well for the

purpose for proving the existence of the

conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that

any such person was a party to it. It is clear that

this second part permits the use of evidence

which otherwise could not be used against the

accused person. It is well settled that act or

action of one of the accused could not be used

as evidence against the other. But an exception

has been carved out in section 10 in cases of

conspiracy. The second part operates only when

the first part of the section is clearly established

i.e. there must be reasonable ground to believe

that two or more persons have conspired



together in the light of the language of section

120A. It is only then the evidence of action or

statements made by one of the accused could be

used as evidence against the other.”



134. Ina later case in Suresh Chandra Bahri

vs Gurbachan Singh AIR 1994 SC 2420, the

Supreme Court of India held as observed:



“In the above context we may refer to the

provisions of section 120A of the Indian Penal

Code which defines criminal conspiracy, It

provides that when two or more persons agree

to do, or cause to be done. (1) an illegal act, or

(2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means,

such agreement is designated a criminal conspi-

racy; provided that no agreement except an

agreement to commit an offence shall amount

to criminal conspiracy unless some act besides

the agreement is done by one or more parties to

such agreement in pursuance thereof. Thus, a

cursory look to the provisions contained in

section 120A reveal that a criminal conspiracy

envisages an agreement between two or more

persons to commit an illegal act or an act which

by itself may not be illegal but the same is done

or executed by illegal means. Thus the essential

ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy

is the agreement to commit an offence. In a case

where the agreement is for accomplishment of

an act which by itself constitutes an offence,

then in that event no overt act is necessary to be

proved by the prosecution because in such a

fact situation criminal conspiracy is established

by proving such an agreement, In other words,

where the conspiracy alleged is with regard to

commission of a serious crime of the nature as

contemplated in section 120B read with the

provision to sub-section (2) of section 120A of

the IPC, then in that event mere proof of an

agreement between the accused for commission

of such a crime alone is enough to bring about

a conviction under section 120B and the proof

of any overt act by the accused or by any one of

them would not be necessary. The provisions in

such a situation do not require that each. and

every person who is a party to the conspiracy

must do some overt act towards the fulfilment

of the object of conspiracy, the essential ingredient



            
being an agreement between the conspirators to commit the crime and if these requirements and ingredients are established the act would fall within the tapping of the provisions contained in section 120B since from its very nature a conspiracy must be

hatched in complete secrecy, because 

the whole purpose may frustrate and it is

common experience and goes without saying that

only in very rare cases one may come across

direct evidence of a criminal conspiracy to

commit anv crime and in most of the cases it is

only the circumstantial evidence which is avail-

able from which an inference giving rise to the

conclusion of an agreement between two or

more persons to commit an offence may be

legitimately drawn.”



135. If thus appears that, in order to cons-

titute the offence of conspiracy, there must first be a

combining together of two or more persons in the

conspiracy; secondly, an act or illegal omission must

take place in pursuance of that conspiracy in order

io the doing of that thing. It is not necessary that the

abetter should concert the offence with the person

who commits it. ]t is sufficient if he engages in the

conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is

committed. Chapter VA, introduced a new offence

defined by section 120A. That offence is called the

offence of criminal conspiracy and consists in a

mere agreement by two or more persons to do or

cause 10 be done an illegal act or an act which is not

illegal by illegal means; there is a proviso to the

section which says that no agreement except an

agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a

criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the

agreement is done by one or more parties to such

dercement in pursuance thereof,



136. So, in terms of the principle

above, each conspirator plays his Separate part in

one integrated and united effort lo achieve the

common purpose. Each one is aware that he has a

part to play in a general conspiracy though he ma

not know all its secrets or the means by which the

common purpose is to be accomplished. The evil

scheme may be promoted by a few, some may drop

out and some may join at a later Stage but he

Conspiracy continues until it is broken up. There

as laid down

general plan to accomplish the Commo,

design by such means as may from time to time tis

found expedient. New techniques may be inventes

and new means may be devised for advancement -

the common plan. The common intention of th.

conspirators then is to work for the furtherance of

the common design. Conspirators do not discuss the

plans in the presence of the stranger or outsider

Since privacy and secrecy are the elements of

criminal conspiracy it is difficult to obtain direc,

evidence in its proof. It can, therefore, be proved by

evidence of surrounding circumstances and conduc;

of the accused both before and after the commission

of the crime.



137. According to the prosecution, the

appellants along with other accused persons hatched

up a conspiracy the killing of the President and his

kith and kin with a view to mitigate their persona]

vengeance and also to fulfil their personal ambition

and with that end in view, they arranged a night

parade on 14th August, 1975, and in the night

parade the appellant Farook Rahman and other co-

accuseds incited the jawans attending it, took arms

from the kote, deployed officers and jawans at key

points and then some of them came to the official

residence of the President and brutally killed him

and his family members and that such yearly night

parade starts in the evening and ends at 11-00 PM

but the night parade of 14th August continued till

early hours of 15th August and moreover, there is no

provision for amalgamation of two units of army in

the parade but the appellants and other accuseds for

the fulfilment of their criminal object in violation of

the Rules amalgamated Lancer unit and Artillery

unit and that further though there is prohibition for

carrying ammunition at such exercise but the

appellants and the co-accuseds carried ammunition

from the kote for the implemen- tation of the object,

it will be necessary to keep in view the limited scope

n this appeal under Article 103(3) of the

Constitution against the judgments and orders of

conviction and sentence by which the High Court

Division confirmed the conviction and sentence

passed by the trial Court. The appellants have not

raised any point as to whether the trial of the

appellants has been vitiated by reason of mis-

reading, non reading or non consideration of the

evidence on record, Despite that we have afforded



            
learned Counsels to argue the appeals at length on merit of the evidence on record for ends of justice since the appellants have been sentence is death.

Farook Rahman and Major Abdur Rashid directed

them to take ammunition and as per their direction

mony of this witness so far as it related to amalga-

 tion store and then as per direction of Major Rashid,

the jawans took cannons, rifles, stenguns, SMG and

that he was a jawan of the field artillery during the

relevant time and he attended the night parade and

then from the parade ground they marched towards

New Airport Road, at about 3-00/3-30 AM Mohi-

uddin (Artillery) came there and made them to fall-

in and directed some jawans to board into the vehi-

lery unit, in which, Major Mohiuddin (Artillery)

his statement. -



152. PW 39 stated that he was a driver of Lan-

cer unit during the relevant time and in his unit

Farook Rahman was the commanding officer-jp.

charge. He also attended the night parade and foung

Mohiuddin (Lancer), Major Shariful Islam and othe;

accused persons present at the parade; Farook

Rahman told them that for an emergency purpose

the tanks would be moved outside and directed them

to get ready, thereafter he told the jawans and

officers to attend to their works, at that time Major

Dalim and another officer came in their unit and

Major Dalim wanted uniform and he was supplied

the uniform and that the tank unit marched via Air-

port towards Bangabhaban.



153. PW 40 stated that during the relevant

time, he was a Lieutenant of Lancer Unit of which

Farook Rahman was the commander and he

attended the night parade and he handed over the

parade to Mohiuddin (Lancer) who then handed

over the parade to Farook Rahman and that the

parade continued till 2-00/3-00 AM although it was

supposed to close up at 12 at night and that Farook

Rahman told him to take care about the regiment

and to close down the gate and he further stated that

in reply to his query, Farook Rahman told him that

they were going to remove autocratic Government.

The defence did not challenge the testimony of this

witness although this witness specifically stated that

Major Farook and other persons were moving to

topple the Government. PW 53 stated that he was 4

Subedar Major of Artillery unit and Mohiuddin

(Artillery) was Papa Battery Commander of thal

unit and that Farook Rahman used to visit the office

of their commanding officer Major Rashid and

talked with him many times in the month of August.

1975. He further stated that Major Rashid arranged

the night training programme in August and as per

programme, he fixed the 14th August night for the



            
purpose and that Mohiuddin took over parade from

Captain Jahangir and then he handed over the

parade to Major Rashid, He further stated that at

about 10-00 PM Major Rashid and Farook Rahman

came to the verandah of his office and some time

thereafter they jointly left the place with a jeep.



154. The above evidence shows that Major

Rashid and Farook Rahman, who as the records

show are close relation, arranged the night parade on

14th night with a view to fulfil their premeditated

plan of conspiracy. Major Rashid, as the records

show, is also a close relation of Khondaker Mus-

taque Ahmed. Records also show that Lieutenant

Colonel Momen, the Commanding Officer of Ist

Lancer Unit was on leave upto 15th August and

Farook Rahman, as 2 IC of the said unit by utilising

the absence of Colonel Momen took control of Ist

Lancer Unit and he in collusion with near relation

Major Rashid, Commanding Officer of 2nd Field

Artillery, as well as other accuseds as a part of cons-

piracy arranged the night parade on 14th night and

dragged it till the early hours of 15th August, and

removed army officers also attended the said parade

and then the officers talked secretly in the office of

Mohiuddin (Lancer) and that Faruque Rahman,

Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) incited the

jawans by their speeches to the effect that Rakhi-

bahini would attack them or that monarchy will be

established and as per their direction the jawans

took heavy arms and ammunition which could be

used during the war time only.



155. It thus appears that PWs 11, 12, 13, 14,



23, 24, 25, 35, 39 and 40 have recognised Farook



Rahman, PWs 11, 12, 14 and 39 have recognised



Mohiuddin (Lancer), PWs 17, 18, 21, 22, 26, 27, 32,



34 and 53 have recognised Mohiuddin (Artillery),



PW 14. recognised Sultan Shahrior and PWs 11, 12,



21] and 22 recognised Bazlul Huda in the said



conspiracy. Further the defence did not challenge



the incriminating part of the evidence of these wit-



nesses about their complicity, such as, night parade

continued beyond the scheduled timetable till 3-

30/4-00 AM, that though there was no provision for

amalgamation of two different units of army at the

night parade but even then amalgamation was made

and that they took ammunition from the kote which

was strictly prohibited and that by violating army

rule they took the tanks and cannons outside the

cantonment during peace period and deployed those

at key points just before the incident and that some

removed army officers attended the night parade and

that there were confidential talks among the accused

officers keeping the jawans in fall-in position by

inciting them and that in terms of the conspiracy

some officers and jawans of the two units including

appellants came out of the cantonment and went to

the house of the President and killed him and his

family members while other officers and jawans

including some appellants remained deployed in

other key points.



156. Further regarding previous conduct of

the appellants depositions show that PW 11 recog-

nised Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman,

Mohiuddin (Lancer), and Bazlul Huda at the night

parade. PW 12 recognised Mohiuddin (Lancer),

Farook Rahman and Bazlul Huda at the night parade

on 14th August. PW 13 recognised Major Mohi-

uddin (Lancer) and Farook Rahman. PW 14

recognised Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Shahriar. PWs

17 and 18 recognised Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-

uddin (Artillery) at the parade ground on 14th night.

PWs 21 and 22 recognised Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-

uddin (Artillery) and Bazlul Huda at the parade

ground. PW 23 recognised Lieutenant Colonel

Farook Rahman at the parade ground. PW 24 recog-

nised. Farook Rahman, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed

(Artillery) and Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar at the

parade ground. PW 25 recognised Mohiuddin

(artillery) and Farook Rahman at the night parade.

PW 27 recognized Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) at

Kalabagan. PW 32 recognized Mohiuddin (Artil-

lery) at the night parade. PW 34 recognized Lieuten-

ant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery) at

Kalabagan. PW 35 recognised Colonel Mohiuddin

(artillery) and Farook Rahman at the night parade

ground, PW 39 recognized Farook Rahman and

Mohiuddin (Lancer) at the night parade ground. PW

40 stated that Farook Rahman told him that they

were moving to topple the autocratic Government,

but instead of toppling the Government, they killed

the President and the members of his family. The

evidence of the above PWs, which have been dis-

cussed in detail while considering the charge of

criminal conspiracy, shows that the appellants along

with co-accuseds and their troops marched from the



            
parade ground towards the key points, took control

or those key points by deploying troops with

artillery and then their object was materialised. All

these acts of the accused are done in one series in the

course of carrying through the design in question

there is community and continuity of purpose. These

conducts of the appellants are relevant which has no

reasonable explanation other than their guilt.



157. The first learned Judge however, dis-

believed PW 24 on the reasoning that in course of

cross-examination on behalf of Farook Rahman in

answer to a suggestion he stated that as per version

of the police he deposed against the accuseds on the

apprehension that otherwise he would be made an

accused in the case as he was found present at the

house of Sherniabat. The second learned Judge,

however, believed PW 24 on the reasonings that a

perusal of his statement in its entirety in cross would

sugeest that he denied the above suggestion but the

learned Sessions Judge recorded his statement in the

positive form inadvertently and as it appears PW 24

denied the almost similar suggestion made to him on

behalf of Colonel Mohiuddin (artillery). Further,

this witness deposed in Court on 19th October,

1997, after more than 22 years of the occurrence and

at this belated stage there was no occasion for him

to harbour any apprehension of being implicated in

Sherniabat’s murder case since the cases were filed

long ago and moreover, the above statement was

made while deposing before the Court and not



before the police.



158. Accordingly, I am in complete agree-

ment with the views of the learned second Judge

that the learned Sessions Judge inadvertently

recorded the suggestion in question in affirmative

although PW 24 replied in negative.



159. The first learned Judge also disbelieved

PW 46 about his identification of the appellants

Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar, Bazlul Huda and

other accuseds at Bangabhaban on the reasoning

that there was nothing on record to show that he

knew them earlier. This finding of the learned Judge

is inconsistent, inasmuch as the learned Judge

himself believed the presence of these appellants at

Bangabhaban and made adverse inference regarding

their presence only in the oath taking ceremony on

the ground that they, being junior army officers,

were not supposed to remain present at Ban,

bhaban in the President's oath taking ceremon.

PWes 15 and 47 also deposed that they saw them ..

Bangabhaban. Therefore, the learned second J 7

has rightly believed witness PW 46, Be



160. As it appears according to the Prosecy

tion story, the appellants along with other ACCUSe,

arranged the parade on the night of 14th August, “i

in the army rule though there was no Provision for

taking arms at such exercise they took arms from the

armory and marched towards Road No. 32, Dhan.

mondi where the President was residing, Minto

Road where the Cabinet Ministers were Staying, the

Radio Station and in front of Rakhibahini Head.

quarter and setting up cannons aiming Rakhibahin;

Headquarter and Road No. 32 to use those if there

was any resistance from the Rakhibahini or othe;

forces and they also took cannon with ammunition

and tanks which could not be taken out of canton.

ment during normal time. These arms, ammunition

and heavy artillery like cannons and tanks they

carried just before the occurrence and set up those

mainly with the motive to resist and prevent the

counter-attack of Government and other security

forces. These preparations of the appellants and

other accuseds have relevancy with the occurrence

in that they took those measures in a calculated way

to bring about the premeditated action of killing.

After taking all these precautions, they attacked the

house of the President situated at Road No.32

Dhanmondi R/A and killed the President and all the

members of his family.



161. In support of the subsequent conduct of

the appellants ad other accuseds, the prosecution has

examined PWs 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 20, 23, 37, 42, 44,

45, 46, 47, 49 and 60. PW 9 stated that on 15th

August at about 3-00 PM he went to the house of the

President as per direction of PW 45 for ascertaining

the condition of that house where Bazlul Huda

received him at the gate of that house and under the

supervision of Mohiuddin (Lancer) the dead body of

the President was sent to Tongipara through a heli-

copter. PW 12 stated that he saw Farook Rahman

while he was coming towards Mirpur Road from

Road No.32 with a tank at 7-15 AM on 15th August.

PW 15 saw Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar, Bazlul

Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) at Bangabhaban 0n







            
the day of occurrence at about 4-00 PM, PW 16 saw

Farook Rahman on a jeep in front of Shanghai Res-

gaurant, Kalabagan, Mirpur Road, on 1Sth August in

the moming While he was approaching towards

south of the house of the President. PW 16 after

going 1 Bangabhaban a” saw Mohiuddin (Artil-

lery) with his troops, PW 20 stated that he saw

Shahar and Farook Rahman and other officers

inside Bangabhaban ater the occurrence. PW 23

ed that after the incident he did not see Farook

Rahman and Mohiuddin (Lancer) in the Lancer Unit

and heard that they were then staying at Banga-

phaban. pW 37 stated that after the incident he at the

studio No.2 of the Radio Station, saw Shahriar,

along with other co-accuseds were preparing speech

of khondker Mustaque Ahmed of Bangladesh Radio

on 15th August 1975 at 7-00 AM. PW 42 stated that

he found Shahriar, Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Farook

Rahman in the Radio Station on 15th August when

the Chief of Army, Navy and Air Force came there

to broadcast their allegiance by radio and that he

giso found Bazlul Huda and Nur when he went to

road No.32 on 15th August at 11-00 AM for taking

pictures of the victims as per direction of the autho-

rity and that he also saw Shahriar Rashid, Farook

Rahman, Mohiuddin (Lancer) and other accused



ersons in the President’s room at Bangabhaban in

the aftemoon. PW 44 stated that while the officers

involved in the killing of 15th August and 3rd

November, were staying in Bangkok, the so-called

“sepahi biplob” (armed revolution) occurred on 7th

November, 1975, and Major General Ziaur Rahman

became the exclusive powerful leader and that after

taking over power, he repatriated the officers

involved in the killing of 15th August and 3rd

November by arranging their service at foreign

embassies of Bangladesh. He further stated that

those officers made abortive attempt of revolt

against General Ziaur Rahman and thereafter they

were removed from the service and thereafter they

led their lives abroad as fugitive. The appellants did

not challenge the statements of this witness, PW 45

stated that at the oath taking ceremony of Khondker

Mustaque Ahmed as President, Bazlul Huda, Farook

Ahmed and other co-accuseds were present, PWs 46

noticed Farook Rahman, Shahriar, Bazlul Huda and

other accused persons were sitting beside Khondker



MAJOR BAZLUL Hupa vs State (Md Tafeceul Islam J 47



Mustaque Ahmed, who was sitting on the chair of

the President at about 3-30 PM at Banga Bhaban on

the day of occurrence. PW 47 also saw Farook

Rahman, Shahriar Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Bazlul

Huda at the oath taking ceremony of Khandaker

Mustaque Ahmed and his Cabinet and that after the

incident of 3rd November, Major Abdur Rashid and

other accused persons left for Bangkok. PW 49

stated that on 15th August Major Dalim introduced

him with Farook Rahman after broadcasting the

allegiance by the Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air

Force in the Radio Station. PW 60 stated that a file

was opened for absorbing some army officers in the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 8th June, 1976 and

thereafter, as per letter of Army Headquarter under

Memo. dated 15th August, 1976, Mohiuddin

(Lancer), Bazlul Huda, Sultan Shahriar and other

co-accused have been deputed to the Ministry of

Foreign A ffairs.



162. The Third learned Judge however was of

the view that the deployment of some of the appel-

lants and other accuséd persons in the foreign

embassies could not be taken as reward for their

involvement in the carnage of 1 5th August and so no

adverse inference could be drawn against them by

reason of such employment.



163. But as it appears most of them were

removed army officer and PWs 44 and 47 proved

that they were absorbed in service by General Ziaur

Rahman after he came to power on 7th November,

1975 and earlier when Khondker Mustaque Ahmed,

selected person, was dethroned by Khaled

Mosharraf they left the country on the evening of

3rd March . If the evidence of PWs 44, 45 and 47 are

read along with those of PW 60 it will appear that

the appellants and other co-accuseds, as part of their

premeditated plan arranged night parade and then

came out from the cantonment with tanks and other

arms without authorisation and some then went to

the house of the President situated at Road No. 32,

and also other key points such as Radio Station,

Minto Road, BDR Headquarter, Rakhibahini Head-

quarter with a view to prevent the Government and

security forces from interfering in their object of

killing the President and his family members and

that afier killing of the President and his family

members they compelled the Chief of Army, Navy



            
and Air Force to express their allegiance after the

killing and accepting Khondker Mustaque Ahmed as

the President of the Republic and that thereafter they

stayed at Bangabhaban and guarded Khondker

Mustaque Ahmed and the Radio Station so that any

other could not topple Khandaker Mushtaque

Ahammed and they attended in the oath taking

ceremonies of the President, his Cabinet although

they were not supposed to be present al such

national ceremonies being petty officers in the army

and some of them including the appellant Sultan

Shahriar were removed officers and some of them



arranged for burying the dead bodies and the act of

flecing away from the country after the incident of

3rd November and taking shelter in Bangkok and

thereafter their absorption at the different Bangla-

deshi Missions by late General Ziaur Rahman and

then on removal from the service after their abortive

attempt to revolt against Ziaur Rahman and their

staying abroad are the circumstances which prove

that they were involved in the killing of the

President and other members of his family. These

conducts of appellants other than accused persons

are relevant under section 8 of the Evidence Act and

may be taken as corroborative evidence for fur-

nishing further proof of the guilt @f the appellants

and other accused persons.



164. The above evidence prove that the appel-

lants and other accuseds made criminal conspiracy to

murder the President and the members of his family.



165. Regarding the fifth ground i.e. the

murder of the President and the members of his

family, the learned Counsels for the appellants made

common submissions that the learned Judges of the

High Court Division upon superficial consideration

of the evidence on record and on mere conjecture

and surmise confirmed the death sentence of the

appellants and failed to consider that there is no

legal evidence on record in support of the charges

under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and that the

appellants along with other accuseds attended the

night parade merely as a routine work and further,

their presence at the parade could not be connected

with the murder of the President and his family

members and the killing of the President and his

family members was a revolt to overthrow the then

Government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and in

consequence of such revolt only, the President ang ;

his family members were killed by the army

which the appellants were not involved.



166. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, learned Coun,

sel appearing for the appellant Bazlul Hud, ana

Mohiuddin (Lancer), further submitted that they. ‘

no reliable evidence in support of the proseciy; on

story that these appellants have been recognised p,,

the informant at the place of occurrence, w.

allegation that Bazlul Huda shot to death Sheiks

Kamal and Bangabandhu is also based on contr,

dictory evidence on record; the prosecution fh,

withheld vital witnesses such as, Sheikh Yunus Aj;

Colonel Moshiud Doula and Colonel Mahmudy

Hasan purposely 2s their evidence would have bee,

unfavourable to the prosecution and therefore 2,

adverse inference may be drawn against the

prosecution for withholcing those vital witnesses.

the allegation that Mohiuddin (Lancer) was taking

the President down from the first floor is based on

no reliable evidence on record and further the

recognition of Mohiuddin (Lancer) by the witnesses

at the place of occurrence is totally absurd and

unbelievable story and further the evidence on

record about the presence of Bazlul Huda and Mohi-

uddin (Lancer) at the place of occurrence is also

contradictory.



167. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, learned Coun-

sel appearing for the appellants Syed Farook

Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) further

submitted that there is no evidence in support of the

charge for causing the murder of the President and

the members of his family by the appellants and PW

1 is not an eye-witness of the occurrence and Mohi-

uddin (artillery) is not an FIR named accused and

his inclusion in the case is a product of concoction:

the story of hoisting of flag and playing bugle in the

house of the President just immediate before the

occurrence as stated by the P.Ws are not believable

since PWs 1-3 stated that at that time the assailants

were already in the house of the President; there 5

at all no evidence on record to show the presence of

Farook Rahman in the house of the President at the

relevant time ; the presence of Mohiuddin (artillery)

with cannon at Kalabagan playground has not bee"

substantiated by adducing reliable evidence; in vie"

of withholding of tank crews an adverse presumption

    
 may be drawn against the prosecution as if they

were produced they would not have supported the

case; in view of the evidence as reveal.

ee the lips of the prosecution Witnesses the real

ad ri of the incident Was Jobaida Rashid; from the

inne of the PWs it will also be evident that the

oi ant had no common intention Or preconcert

af og their being involved in the under of the

section 302/34 was illegel.



168. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, learned Coun-

cagaring for Sultan Shahriar, further submitted



«el ee js no reliable evidence regarding Sultan

th nes complicity in the murder of the President

seb of his family; he did not go to House

mm a ot Dhanmondi; the High Court Division

Noo iy jaw in relying upon the testimony of PW 14

cee his presence at the night parade at Balur-

” reve though there is no corroborating evidence

a and if the evidence of PW 14 is disbelieved

i remains only evidence against Sultan Shahriar

or ding his presence at the Radio Station at about

ant 4M on 15th August and this fact has no nexus

vp the murder of the President and his family

embers 28 being reemployed with effect from 15th

zst, 1975, his presence in the Radio Station was

: oat of his official duty which he had carried out as



per direction of his Commanding Officer.



169. The learned Counsels, in support of their

contentions, referred the cases of Nurul Islam vs

Sate, 43 DLR (AD) 6, Hazrat Khan @ Hazrat Ali vs

Sate, 54 DLR 636, Moslemuddin vs State, 38 DLR

(AD) 311, Safdor Ali vs Crown, 5 DLR (FC) 107 and

Moyecuddin vs State, 31 DLR (AD) 37. Mr Anisul

Hug and learned Attorney-General submitted that

the evidence that came forth from the deposition of

the witnesses proved the charge of murder and

further Exhibit X, the copy of the “Sunday Times”

and also the electronic evidence, Material Exhibits

12 and 32 also proved charge of murder. The learned

Attomey-General and Mr Azmalul Hossain to prove

the charge of murder also relied upon the extra-



judicial confessions of the appellants as disclosed by

PWs 8 and 15,



170. At first the submission made by the



seni for the State in respect of the publication



1B f ee

HUDA Vs STATE (Md Tereecul Isom J) 49



as made in Sunday Times, Exhibit X, and also

Electronic evidence Material Exhibit Nos. 32 and 12

Are taken up for consideration.



171. PW 58, exhibited the issue of the

Sunday Times" dated 8-5-1976, which was marked

Exhibit X with a note of objection by the defence,

Stating that he while acting as Director, Ministry of

Foreign Affairs, at the request of Criminal Investi-

gation Department, CID, collected a copy of the

Sunday Times" through the then Councilor of Ban-

gladesh High Commission at London, in which the

appellant Farook Rahman, admitted his complicity

by saying "I helped to kill Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,

dare to put me on trial", PW 58, also proved the for-

warding letter with the signature of the Councilor by

which the above Journal was sent to him. PW 58

also exhibited with objection Exhibit 32, a video

cassette broadcasted by Granada Independent

Television in the UK on 2nd August 1976, along

with notarised certificate issued by Keith Robert

Hopkins, Notary Public, certifying that to the best of

his knowledge, information and belief, the said

video cassette is an authentic copy of a television

programme. Further, Mr Boktiar Hossain, PW 59, a

local video recorder, also proved the video cassette,

Exhibit-12, in which Major Rashid and Farook Rah-

man, in an interview by Anthony Mascaranthus

stated that they killed Sheikh Mujib along with his

family. According to the Learned Attorney the issue

of "Sunday Times", Exhibit X, is a document within

the meaning of section 3 of Evidence Act in which

Farook Rahman admitted his participation in the

killing of the President while giving his interview

and further the incident of 15th August 1975 being a

sad historic fact in Bangladesh, any book or

document in reference to the above incident may be

taken as judicial notice under the provisions of

section 57 of the Evidence Act on such a fact and

further since Faruque Rahman during cross exami-

nation did not deny his said interview with Anthony

Mascaranthus, the video cassettes, Material Exhibits

32 and Exhibit 12, may also be admitted as



evidence.



172. However, as it appears in terms of

section 57 of Evidence Act, the Court itself may take

cognizance of certain matter which are so notorious

or so clearly established that the evidence of their



            
existence is deemed unnecessary. But as it appears

the alleged statement made by appellant

Rahman to a reporter of the issue of the ''Sunday

Times” is in the nature of hearsay evidence 

prosecution did not examine the reporter Who inter

viewed the above appellant,

admission of digital or

electronic evidence, as it appears the party 

to admit any statement or admission of any pers 

recorded in a compact disk or video cassette or al ,

interview conducted by any television a rake

relating to a relevant fact or facts in Issue, must also

disk or video cassette



produce the original compact on

d in the television chan-



or the programme publishe

nel with the certificate of the producer of the pro-

sume certifying the date and place of the record



173. Regarding the admission of digital or electric evidence, as it appears the party seeking to admit any statement or admission of any person recorded in any person recorded in a compact disk or video cassette or any interview conducted by any television channel relating to a relevant fact or facts in issue, must also produce the original compact disk or video cassette or the programme published in the television channel with the certificate of the producer of the programme and further the signature of the producer in the certificate has also to be proved. In the present appeals, these requirements have not been met.



174. However as regards admissibility of a

statement recorded in a compact disk or video cas-

sette or in a television channel, if the accused does

not deny his statement or admission, there is no

difficulty in admitting such digital or electronic

evidence as documentary evidence. However, if the



accused denies the statement or admission, the’



question of its admissibility has to be looked into

under the prevailing law of evidence. As it appears

the expression ‘evidence’ has been defined in

section 3 of the Evidence Act which is as follows:



‘Evidence’ means and includes—



(1) all statements which the Court permits

or requires to be made before it by a witness, in

relation to matters of fact under enquiry; such

statements are called oral evidence;



. (2) All documents produced for the

inspection of the Court, such documents are

called documentary evidence,



However in India sub-section 2 of section 3

of the Evidence Act as above has been substi-

tuted in the year is as follows:



(2) all documents including electronic record

produced for the inspection of the Court; such

?

documents are called documentary evidence



go, in terms of the above amendmen, in

in criminal matters, evidence can also be

of electronic record as video Cassette

and video conferencing.



India,



by way



compact disk



175, Inthe case of State of Maharashtra vs p,.

Praful B. Desai, (2003) 4 scc 601 the Supreme

Court of India ruled that the evidence taken from 4

witness through video conferencing is Compatible

with the requirements of the Code.



176. The modes for recording evidence has

been expressly laid down in section 353 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure which provides that except as

otherwise provided, all evidence taken under

chapter XX, XXII and XXIII shall be taken in the

presence of the accused, or, when his personal

attendance is dispensed with, in presence of his

Advocate. This shows that though the actual physi-

cal presence of the accused is necessary while

taking evidence, it may be dispensed with in certain

circumstances.



177. However, the Evidence Act of 1872 isa

procedural law and at the same time is an ongoing

statute. According to Francis Benion, the principle

of interpretation of an ongoing statute should be that

Parliament intends the Court to apply to an ongoing

Act a construction that continuously updates its

wordings to allow for changes in an Act which was

initially framed. While it remains law it has to be

treated as always speaking.



178. Further, Bhagabati J in the case of

National Textile Workers’ Union vs PR Rama-

krishnan, AIR 1983 SC 75, Bhagwati, J speaking for

the majority observed as follows.



“We cannot allow the dead hand of the past

to stifle the growth of the living present. Law

cannot stand still; it must change with the

changing social concepts and values. If the bark

that protects the tree fails to grow and expand

along with the tree, it will either choke the tree

or if it is a living tree, it will shed that bark and

grow a new living bark for itself. Similarly, if

the law fails to respond the needs of changing

society, then either it will stifle the growth of

the society and choke its progress or if the

society is vigorous enough, it will cast away the

law which stands in the way of its growth. Law



            
therefore constantly be on the move

i itself to the fast-changing society and

not lag behind.



179. Accordingly, it is high time to evaluate

she slogical developments are transforming

ow yee of the legal system. With the emer-

the he reve technologies, uncertainties arise

gence ° rd to the application of existing laws and

with ey there is a need to create new laws to

segs rir use, However, at the same time it is to

regulate ‘mind that need for regulating new techno-

e KE S aasaally prompted by social and cultural

jogies ane about the advantage of a particular tech-

ae alternatively, the scope of its misuse.



180. The challenges before the criminal jus-

_. eystem are to balance the rights of the accused

eon dispensing speedy and effective justice. The

r nal justice system machinery must also meet

om pallenge of effectively dealing with the emer-

sine forms of crime and behaviour of criminals. It is

“so hoped that the obsolete laws or obsolete

tials of laws prevailing in the country will be

smended and new suitable laws will also be enacted

o respond to the needs of changing society as was

gone in India in respect of electronic evidence.



181. However, because of the express provi-

sions in the existing law as referred earlier as to how

evidence are to be taken, I am of the view that the

electronic evidence produced by the prosecution in

this case cannot be used.



182. Regarding the extra-judicial confession

as disclosed by PWs 8 and 15 in support of charge

against the appellants for murder, as it appears, as

those statements have not been challenged by the

defence during cross-examination.



183, As it appears PW 8, who was working in

the army in the rank of Captain during the relevant

lime, in his deposition stated that being deputed by

Chief of Army Staff to report after ascertaining the

Teal position in the house of the President, he visited

the said house on 15th August at about 8-45 AM.

PW 8 had stated that Major Nur Chowdhury and



zlul Huda received him and thereupon Bazlul

da took him inside the house. He narrated the

*lual position as noticed there as follows:

    

184. It thus appears that appellant Bazlul

Huda admitted to this witness that he killed Sheikh

Kamal because he was giving information about the

incident outside. He also admitted that they killed

one security personnel as he was altercating with



them and thereafter on query about the cause of

death of Sheikh Naser, Captain Huda remained

he killing of the



silent and on further query about t t

President he replied that as the President queried



why they came there and asked about Shafiullah that

prompted him to shoot him and on further query

about the killing of womenfolk Bazlul Huda replied

that the situation went beyond their control and the

sepoys killed them There is no denial either directly

or indirectly about those admissions of Bazlul Huda

to PW 8. These evidence remain uncontroverted

whether these statements may be taken as extra-judi-

cial confession in which Bazlul Huda has admitted

about his active role and killing of Sheikh Kamal by

gun shot whether the other appellants Farook Rah-

man, Sultan Shahriar. Mohiuddin (Lancer) and

Mohiuddin can be convicted relying upon this state-

ment. It thus shows that while in Bangabhahan PW

15, found Farook Rahman, Major Abdur Rashid,

Sultan Shahriar, Major Shariful Hoque Dalim,

Major Aziz Pasha, Mohiuddin (Lancer), Bazlul

Huda and others were gossiping during which they

disclosed how they killed the President and his

family members.





185. On behalf of the appellants it was argued

the prosecution did not raise this point in the Courts

below and therefore, this point cannot be taken into

consideration at this stage and further the alleged

statement not being communicated to PW 5 by this

witness in no circumstances the same can be treated

as extra-judicial confession. PW 15 in his statement



stated that—





186. The appellants have not denied those

statements by way of cross-examining this Witness

or by way of giving him any suggestion. On behalf

of Sultan Shahriar, suggestion was given to this

witness in evasive manner and the above statement

as made by this witness was not directly. Now the

question is, whether the above statement can be

taken as extra-judicial confession since it has no,

been communicated by the above accuseds to this

witness by stating to him that they killed the President and his family members. It also appears that

this point has not been canvassed in the Courts

below. But this being a question of law as to whether

any such statement made by an accused relating to

the incident to which he has faced trial and directly

relevant to the point involved in this case, its impli-

cation should be considered.



187. From the statements quoted above it

appears that admittedly Farook Rahman, Sultan

Shahriar and Mohiuddin (artillery) have in course of

their conversation said they have killed the Presi-

dent and members of his family including Colonel

Jamil. It is also a fact that this statement has not

been communicated to PW 15 but this witness has

overheard the same. As it appears admissions and

confessions are dealt with in sections 24-30 of the

Evidence Act in respect of admissibility of those.

These are exceptions to the general rule of evidence

and they are placed in the category of “relevant fact”

since they are declarations against the maker, the

probative value of such admissions or confessions

do not depend upon its communication to another

and they can be admitted into evidence if they a

proved by a witness.



188. A confessional soliloquy is an expres-

sion of conflict of emotion, a conscious effort to

stifle the pricked conscience; or an argument to find



            


excuse or justification for his act or a pertinent or

 of exaggeration of part in the crime;



189. In Sahoo vs State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR

1966 SC 40 the convict Sahoo developed illicit inti-

ie av +, his daughter-in-law Sundar Patti (son's

There was quarrel between them on a pre-



secsion of f the occurrence and Sundar Patti



we are the house of one Md Abdullah, a neigh-

oe Foes convict brought her back and passed the

agth ber in one room of their house. On the

ne”. of the date of occurrence Sundar Patti was

ee egth injuries in the room and the convict was

gor ® nd present. Sundar Patti was admitted in the

nr -, the afternoon and she died after 12/13

es The convict was put on trial for the charge of

om The evidence produced by the prosecution

on extras judicial confession and circumstantial

al -c. The extra-judicial confession was proved

oes: Seating that on the fateful morning at

ee AM they saw the convict was going out of his

ce wurmsuring that “he had finished Sundar Patti



SD wet finished the daily quarrels.” The



of ors wheter the muttrings ofthe accused

_vei by four witnesses could be taken as extre-



oka confession.



190. The Supreme Court of India in the facts

ote given case observed as follows:



“But there is 2 clear distinction between the

sdmissibility of evidence and the weight to be

aiached to it. A confessional soliloquy is a

direct piece of evidence. It may be an expres-

sion of conflict of emotion, a conscious effort to

stifle the pricked conscience; an argument to

find excuse or justification for his act; or a

penitent or remorseful act of exaggeration of his

part in the crime. The tone may be soft and low;

the words may be confused; they may be

capable of conflicting interpretations depending

on witnesses, whether they are biased or honest,

intelligent or ignorant, imaginative or prosaic,

as the case may be. Generally they are

mutterings of a confused mind. Before such

evidence can be accepted, it must be established

by cogent evidence what were the exact words

used by the accused. Even if so much was

established. prudence and justice demand the

such evidence cannot be made the sole ground

of conviction. It may be used only as 2

corroborative piece of evidence.” '



191. Azmalul Hossain. QC im this re



has referred to the case of State of UP ws ue

Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48 on this point Lin ths

the accused killed his wife and two children. Wit-

ness PW 9 stated that. the accused was seen sifting

in the adjoining room and on seeing him this v witness

asked him as an what has been found about the

murder and in reply the accused appealed “to God to

excuse him that he had committed m

murdered his wife and two children.” The learned

Sessions Judge reproduced the statement

witness as follows:



“Oh God, pardon me, I have done a blue

der, I have murdered my wife and children.”







192. Question arose before the Supreme

Court of India as to whether the above is extra-ju a-

cial confession deposed by PW 9 can be the sole

basis for conviction of the accused. The Supreme

Court of India considered this point in the light of

the views taken in the case of Sahoo (supra) and

other decisions and was of the view that there is

neither any rule nor of prudence that evidence fur-

nished by extra-judicial confession cannot be relied

upon unless corroborated by some other credible

evidence. The Indian Supreme Court on evaluation

of the earlier decisions AIR 1974 SC 1545. (1975) !

SCR 747, AIR 1975 SC 258, AIR 1966 SC 40 and

AIR 1977 SC 2274) concluded as follows:



“It thus appears that extra-judicial con-

fession appears to have been treated as a weak

piece of evidence but there is no rule of law nor

tule of prudence that it cannot be acted upon

unless corroborated. If the evidence about

extra-judicial confession comes from the mouth

of witness/witnesses who appear to be un-

biased, not even remotely inimical to the

accused, and in respect of whom nothing is

brought out which may tend to indicate that he

may have a motive for attributing an untruthful

statement to the accused; the words spoken to

by the witness are clear, unambiguous and

unmistakably convey that the accused is the



            
perpetrator of the crime and nothing is omitted

by the witness which may militate against it,

then after subjecting the evidence of the witness

to a rigorous test, on the touchstone of eredi-

bility, if it passes the test, the extra-judicial con-

fession can be accepted and can be the basis of

a conviction, In such a situation to go in search

of corroboration itself tends to cast a shadow of

doubt over the evidence. If the evidence of

extra-judicial confession is reliable, trustworthy

and beyond reproach the same can be relied

upon and a conviction can be founded thereon.”



193. But however in the present appeals there

is difference in the disclosure of extra-judicial con-

fession by PWs § and 15 as whatever admission

made by Bi zlul Huda and proved by PW 8 was

direct in nature but has the element of hearsay and

the other one by PW 15 is indirect in nature and

further, the statements of the appellants have not

been depicted in verbatim as was done in the above



cited case.



194. As it appears to prove the charge to

leveled against the appellant Bazlul Huda, the pro-

secution examined AFM Mohitul Islam (PW 1),

Habilder Md Quddus Sikder (PW 4), Nk.Subedar

Abdul Gani (PW 5), Habilder Ganner Sohrab Ali

(PW 6), ALD Sirajul Hug (PW 12), LicutenantNaik

Abdul Khalek (PW 21), Habilder Abdul Aziz (PW

22). The leamed Judges of the High Court Division

have exhaustively reproduced their evidence in their



judgment.



195. PW 1, the informant, was deputed at

House No. 677 of Road No.32, Dhanmondi as the

resident PA of the President during the relevant

time. He stated that on the day of occurrence at

about 4-30 /5-00 AM, the telephone mechanic Abdul

Matin woke him up stating that the President wanted

to talk to him over telephone and after he took the

receiver the President directed him to connect the

Police Control Room stating that the miscreants

attacked the house of Sherniabat, brother-in-law of

the President. He tried but failed to connect the

police control room and then though got convection

of Ganabhaban but there was no response, In the

meantime the President came down into the office

room and wanted to talk himself by taking the

receiver from him. At that time shower Of bullets hi

the wall of the office room breaking the Windy

glass whereupon they lay down beside the lable

After a break of firing the President went UPStairg

and Sheikh Kamal got down and stood op the

verandah, At that time 3/4 army personnel jn khaki

and black dress with arms in their hands stoog in

front of them and the appellant Bazlul Huda shoy on

the leg of Sheikh Kamal who then fell down and lold

PW | to intimate the assailant that he was the Son of

Sheikh Mujib and when PW | informed the ASSailany

about the identity of Sheikh Kamal appellant Bazjy

Huda brushfired aiming Sheikh Kamal. One bulley

hit his leg and another hit PW 50's leg. Sheikh

Kamal died on the spot. At one stage PW 50 wanted

to take out PW I through the back side door ang

when they came nearer to the door, Bazlul Fuda

grabbing his hair pulled him back. There were other

armed army personnel with him. Bazlul Huda lined

up PW | and others in front of the main gate. Some

time thereafter he heard shouting noise of Banga-

bandhu and heard indiscriminate firing and also

screaming of women. He also narrated how Sheikh

Naser was shot to death and the uttering of Bazlul

Huda on query made by Farook Rahman that “all

are finished”, On hearing the above uttering of

Bazlul Huda, he understood that the President and

his family members were brutally killed. The

defence in course of the cross-examination, did not

challenge the statement of this witness regarding

killing of Sheikh Kamal and therefore, the statement

of this witness remains uncontroverted. PW 4, an

army jawan, posted in the field artillery regiment

and during the relevant time deputed at the house of

the President along with other army personnel of his

company, stated that Bazlul Huda and 3 other army

personnel were from the field artillery units, on [Sth

August, 1975 at about 5-00 AM he along with other

guards noticed that Subedar Major Abdul Wahab

Joarder was getting down from the jeep in front of

the house situated on Road No.3! where he along

with other guards were staying using it as temporary

barrack for guarding the house of the President:

thereafier he along with other guards started towards

the house of the President and afer reaching there

they hoisted flag upon playing bugle and at that time

he noticed indiscriminate firing towards the house



            
of the president from the southern side of the lake

and at the time black and khaki dressed army personnel red into the house by shouting ‘hands up’

son cl oat time he saw Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin

and a vad another at the gate. On secing Sheikh



er .

un who was standing on the verandah, Bazlul

ma’.



Ka iq shot at him with sten gun and Sheikh Kamal

wr «un inside the reception room. Bazlul Huda

get oY st at Sheikh Kamal and killed him, There-

agait Tohiv ddin (Lancer) with his force went to the

aftet “a by firing; thereafter Bazlul Huda and

firs with their force followed him, this witness as

Nev gir direction also followed them, He saw that

at T aain and his force were taking President

Mo the ground floor at that time the President

uae «otal f BPI” and soon thereafter, Bazlul

va ga and Major Nur shot at Bangabandhu with their

ejenguns, who died on the spot. The statement of

ahis witness that he saw Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin

(Lancer) at the gate, that Bazlul Huda, Major Noor

and his force approached to the first floor and that

Bazlul Huda and Major Noor shot at the President

on the stair had not been denied by Bazlul Huda in

course of cross-examination or by giving suggestion

to him and then the incriminating part of the state-

ment of this witness remain, uncontroverted.

Appellant Mohiuddin (Lancer) also did not

challenge the testimony of this witness as regards

his recognition by this witness at the gate of the

house of the President and also the statement of this

witness that he saw Mohiuddin (Lancer) and his

force bringing Bangabandhu down to the ground

floor.



196. PW S, also a jawan of Artillery unit and

was deputed at Bangabandhu’s house as security

guard, stated that he was present at the house of the

President at the time of occurrence at about 5-00

AM and that after hoisting the flag he noticed

indiscriminate firing towards the house of the

President whereupon when he went towards the

guard room, 5/7 minutes thereafter the firing

Stopped and at that time he saw Bazlul Huda, Major

Noor and other jawans in khaki and black dress got

down from a vehicle in front of the house of the

resident and Bazlul Huda queried to him and then

he talked with another over wireless, soon thereafter

eastern side and by saying “ hands up” entered into

house of the President by opening fire and that he

along with other guards was kept confined in the

guard room. The defence did not challenge his state-

ment that he recognised Bazlul Huda and Mohi-

uddin (Lancer) while they were entering into the

house of the President by firing.



197. PW 6 who was also a member of the

Guard Regiment at the house of President stated that

on 15th August at about 4-30 AM. Habilder Gani

made all the security staff to fall-in front of guard

room of the house of the President and some time

thereafter 2/3 trucks with force in black dress

stopped towards the western side of Bangabandhu’s

house and there was firing towards house of the

President from the lake side and in corroboration

with the testimonies of PWs | and 4, he stated that

Bazlul Huda, another officer of Lancer unit with



‘black dress, and some jawans of Artillery unit



entered into the house of the President. Soon there-

after Bazlul Huda and another shot at Sheikh Kamal

who rolled down inside the reception room on

sustaining gun shot injury. Bazlul Huda again shot at

him. Thereafter Bazlul Huda and another officer

went to the first floor. Some time thereafter he heard

sounds of firing and screaming of women. In cross-

examination Bazlul Huda did not challenge the

incriminating part of the statement of this witness

and therefore, the statement of PW 6 that he saw

Bazlul Huda while he shot to death Sheikh Kamal

remains uncontroverted.



198. PW 11 stated that he attended the night

parade on 14th August which was arranged in front

of his store. He identified Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin

(Lancer) and Farook Rahman there. He stated that at

about 4-00 AM when he along with others came

near the house of the President by vehicle and at

about 4-30 AM when they were at about 80 yards

west of the house of the President were asked to get

down from the vehicle and then Resalder Sarwar

told him to follow the order of Mohiuddin and then

Mohiuddin directed them not to allow movement of

people in front of the house of the President and to.

disarm the police on duty, He heard sounds of firing

inside the house of Bangabandhu and then heard the

order saying ‘hands up’, that Resalder Sarwar

directed him not to allow anybody to enter into



            
199. PW 12, who during the relevant time

was serving in the First Bengal: Lancer Unit of

which Farook Rahman was the commanding officer,

seamed that in the parade ground he saw the appellant

Rarlu! Huda and other accuseds including Farook

Rahman and Mohiuddin (Lancer) and that in the

Rahman briefed them that on 15th August, 1975 a

meeting would be held in the university and in the

s2id meeting the President would declare monarchy

Wield Artitlery of Papa Hattery diving: the relovany

tine, stated that he attonded the night parade ang

thereafter he along with other solders Was kept

Avan he heard sounds of firing towards the eastern

side and thereafter he came to know that the appel-

lant and other accused persons killed Bangabandhu

and the members of his family.



201. PW 22, a sepoy of Two Field Artillery

during the relevant time stated that he was present ut

the night parade on [4th night till 12 at night and at

about 2-30 AM the commending officer Khondker

Abdur Rashid, along with the appellant Bazlul Huda

and some other officers, came there and Major



Rashid told them to get ready for special duty and if



necessary they were required to open fire. He

corroborated the testimony of PW 21 about their

coming to Road No.32 and his recognition of the

appellant, The appellant declined to cross examine



him.



202. To prove the charge of murder levelled

against appellant Mohiuddin (Lancer), the prosectl-

tion has examined PWs 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 21, 22.



203. PW 4 stated that he recognised Mohi-

uddin (Lancer) along with appellant Bazlul Huda at



            
the gate of Bangabandhu’s house and that this appel-

along with the force of his unit ascended to the

floor of the house of the President by firing and

firs fter they brought the President down and

ner cy were on the stair Bazlul Huda and Major

when chot him to death and that after killing of the

Noor jent this appellant and others got down and left

me south. In course of cross-examination, this

Is did not challenge the statements of PW 4

ding the incriminating part of his involvement

ram incident and therefore, the evidence that the

slant along with his force entered into the house

of the president by firing and brought Bangabandhu 

gown on the point of arms remained uncontroverted.





204. PW 5 corroborated the statement of PW

4 that this appellant along with his force entered into

the house by firing. The appellant has not chal-

jenged the testimony of this 99 witness and thus the

:gentification of the appellant at the place of occur-

rence and his direct participation in the carnage as

deposed by this witness, remain uncontroverted, PW

\] had identified this appellant at the parade and

also saw two persons in the civilian dress who came

out of the office of this appellant at about 12 at night

on 14th August and at that time this appellant called

“Huda” to come towards him. This witness also

stated that this appellant arranged army dress for

those two persons who were in civil dress. While

discussing the evidence of this witness about the

complicity of Bazlul Huda, the complicity of this

appellant has been discussed as well.



205. PW 12 also identified this appellant at

the parade ground on 14th August and stated that

this appellant directed the army personnel who were

at the parade to board into the vehicle and at about

4-30 AM they came to the meeting point of Dhan-

mondi Road No,32 by six trucks via Balurghat,

Cantonment-rail crossing -Mohakhali road and

Farm Gate and he was with the appellant in the same

truck and that this appellant directed all of them to

Set down from the truck at the meeting point of

Road No.32 and then this appellant briefed them

Stating that they should not be frightened on hearing

the sound of firing as those firing will be from the

force of Major Dalim who were inside the house and

Ineteafter, this appellant along with some force



“tered into Road No.32. In course of cross-exami-





nation, this appellant did not challenge the

incriminating part of his complicity that he entered

into the house of the President at Road No.3? with

his force. The evidence of this witness has been

narrated while considering the complicity of appel-

lant Bazlul Huda. In cross-examination, this witness

reconfirmed his statement made in his chief

regarding his presence at the parade ground and his

entering into the house of the President situated at

Road No.32 with his force Just immediate prior to

the occurrence.



206. PW 22 made statements corroborating

the statements of PW 21, whose evidence has

already been discussed while considering the com-

plicity of Bazlul Huda. He further stated that he

along with PW 21 and other army personnel were

dropped on Road No.32 by the side of a canal, that

the commander directed them to ensure that no

outsider enters Road No.32, that thereafter he heard

sounds of firing and that he along with Naik Nazrul,

sepoy Khalek and others proceeded towards east

and found army personnel of Artillery unit and

Lancer unit standing in front of a house and on

query he came to know that the house belonged to

the President; thereafter he along with the guards,

commander Nazrul, Khalek and others entered into

and on coming out of the house and their query the

army personnel standing at the gate, informant them

that Mohiuddin (Lancer) and other officers killed

Bangabandhu and his family members. This appel-

lant did not challenge those incriminating part of the

evidence of this witness in course of cross-exami-

nation and thus his evidence remained

uncontroverted.



207. To prove the charge of murder levelled

against. Farook Rahman, the prosecution examined

PWs 1, 4, 11 and 12.



208. PW 1 stated that at the time of occur-

rence he saw Farook Rahman at the gate of the

house of the President and on query of Farook Rah-

man, Bazlul Huda told him that “all are finished.”

The recognition of the appellant by this witness has

not been challenged in course of cross-examination.



209. PW 4 stated that at or about the time of

occurrence, Major Farook came in front of the main



            
gate of the house of the President with a tank and at

that time Major Noor, Major Aziz Pasha, Mohiuddin

(Lancer) Bazlul Huda and others went to him and

talked with him for some time. This witness

identified Farook Rahman in the dock and further

stated that some time thereafter Farook Rahman

called Bazlul Huda and Subedar Major Abdul

Wahab and decorated Bazlul Huda with a badge of

Major and Subedar Abdul Wahab Joarder with a

badge of Lieutenant and then he addressed them as

Major Huda and Lieutenant Joarder respectively.

The presence of this appellant at the gate of the

house of the President at or about the time of occur-



rence as deposed by this witness has not been denied



by this appellant.



210. PW 11 deposed that in the night parade

on 14th August 1975 he saw 2 IC Farook Rahman

and at that time Resalder Moslehuddin saluteu him.

This witness then narrated about the marching of the

troops towards the house of the President and then

narrated the killing incident vividly. He further

stated that Farook Rahman came with a tank at the

gate of Bangabandhu’s house when Mohiuddin

(Lancer) Major Noor, Bazlul Huda, Resalder Sarwar

and other army personnel of artillery unit went

nearer to him, that they talked with him for some

time and thereafter Farook Rahman left with the

tank. He identified Farook Rahman in the dock. He

did not challenge the statements made by this

witness about his identification in the parade ground

and at the gate of Bangabandhu’s house with tank at

or about the time of occurrence.



211. PW 12 made statements corroborating

PW 11 and stated that he saw Farook Rahman and

other accused persons at the parade on 14th August

night. He further stated that Farook Rahman

inspected the parade and directed to follow RDM

night class and thereafter they were made to fall-in

at 3-30 AM, Farook Rahman, Mohiuddin (Lancer)

and other accused persons consulted among them-

selves by the side of parade ground and then they

came in front of them. Thereafter this witness

narrated about marching of the troops towards the

Road No.32 from the parade ground and also

narrated the manner of hearing sounds of firing after

reaching to the place of occurrence. To prove the

charge of murder levelled against appellant Sultan

Shahriar, the prosecution has examined PW Is,

show his presence at the night parade at Balurgh.

whereon conspiracy was made to kill the President



and his family.



212. PW 14 stated that he was present at th

night parade on 14th August at Balurghat Which

ended at 2-00/2-30 AM, that at that time they , ae

directed to fall-in, that after coming to the Parad

ground he saw Farook Rahman, Mohiuddin and

other accused persons and two other persons in civil

dress; along with them, he also saw Major Rashig

with some officers of artillery unit, Farook Rahmap

directed them to fall-in for an important task ang

thereafter he introduced two persons in Civil dress a.

Major Dalim and the other as Major Sultan Shahria,

this appellant Faruque Rahman told that PW 14 ang

other jawans would work with them and that the

troops were required to obey their directions. There.

after, he narrated about the movement of the tanks

and the other incidents. The defence did not

challenge the statement of this witness that he came

at the night parade at Balurghat at 2-00 to '-30 in

civil dress or that Farook Rahman introduced the

jowans about the identity of the appellant. The evi-

dence of this witness so far as it relates to the incri-

minating portion about his participation in the night

parade and his identification remained uncontro-

verted.



213. Admittedly this appellant was a dismissed

released officer from the army and he was not sup-

posed to remain present at the army’s parade at mid-

night on 14th August 1975, The learned Counsel of

the appellant contended that there is no corrobo-

rating evidence of PW 14 to show that this appellant

was present at Balurghat. But as it appears, this

appellant did not deny the statements of PW |4

about his presence at Balurghat, he also did not give

any explanation in his explanation under section 347

of the Code despite the fact that he was confronted

with the statement of PW 14. There is no rule of la.

that the uncorroborated testimony of one witness

cannot be accepted.



214. Asa general rule, a Court may ac! on the

testimony of a single witness, though uncorrobo-

rated. Unless corroboration is insisted upon by

statute, the Court should not insist on corroboration.

except in cases where the nature of the testimony of



            
sale witness itself requires that corroboration

should be insisted Upon, and that the question,

whether corroboration of the testimony of a single

or was not necessary, must depend upon

tis and circumstances of each case.





215. To prove the charge of murder levelled



: “Mohiuddin (artillery) the prosecution has

the truck and then they returned to their barrack.

This appellant during cross-examination did not

challenge the statement of this witness relating to

the incriminating portion.



216. PW 18, another army personnel of Two

Field Artillery regiment, stated that the appellant

was their Battery Commander and he narrated the

details in respect of parade on 14th August night, in

Which, this appellant and other accused persons

"ere present. He stated that the night training conti-

appellant came there and Captain Jahangir told them

that they had to perform an important task of

checking Rakshibahini and directed them to board

into the vehicle. This witness then narrated about the

approaching of their vehicle towards Dhanmondi.

When he heard 4 rounds of firing and some time

thereafter this appellant told them to assemble the

cannons and as per his direction, they proceeded

towards Ganabhaban and after reaching there the

appellant got down from the vehicle and after one

hour he came back and directed them to go to the

Radio Station via New Market.



217. PW 21, a sepoy of Two Field Artillery

Papa Battery, stated that the appellant was comman-

der of Papa Battery. He narrated about the night

parade in which appellant Mohiuddin (Artillery) and

other accused persons were present. He further

stated that at about 4-00/4-30 AM their truck with

arms approached towards Road No.32 and after

stopping at Road No.32, some of the army personnel

were directed to get down from the vehicle and they

were also directed not to allow anybody to move

through the Road No.32. The defence did not

challenge the statements of this witness in any

manner. PWs 22, 24 and 25 narrated the night

parade on 14th August of Two Field Artillery Unit of

Papa Battery at the airport area in which their com-

mander the appellant was present. Their statements

have not been denied by this appellant. PW 25

further stated that after the parade Farook Rahman

briefed them.



218. PW 27, also a sepoy of Two Field Artil-

lery of Papa Battery under Mohiuddin (artillery)

during the relevant time narrated the details of the

night parade on 14th August and that as per

direction of the appellant and as per his order he

boarded on a vehicle and that when the vehicle came

to Balurghat, the appellant told them that Rakhi-

bahini might attack army and thereafter he saw that

a cannon was hooked with a vehicle and the other

vehicles were also hooked with cannons and there-

after they approached towards the Kalabagan via

Mohakhali-Farmgate-Green Road-Elephant Road

and that some of them were directed to get down

from the vehicle near Kalabagan and the appellants

told them not to allow any body to move on the

road. He further stated that when the sun rose one

army vehicle took them to Ganabhaban and there he



            
heard the voice of Major Dalim over radio that

Rangabandhu was killed. This appellant did not

challenge the testimony of this witness regarding the

incriminating part of his complicity in the incident,

PW 29, another sepoy of the Papa Battery of Two

Field Artillery Unit, stated that the appellant was the

commander of papa battery and he narrated the

details about the night parade and stated that at

about 3-30 AM the parade was closed and thereafter

they were taken to Balurghat and whereupon they

found that the army personnel were loading arms in

the vehicles. They were directed to load arms,

Thereafter they started towards the town,



219. PW 32, a sepoy of Two Field Artillery

under the command of the appellant, stated that he

attended the night parade on 14th night and that

their unit was made to fall-in when this appellant

and other officers were present and they were made

to fall-in for the second time at 3-00/3-30 AM when

Major Rashid and other accused were present and

that as per order of Major Rashid they boarded into

the truck and at that time Naik Shamsul Islam gave

him ammunition. He further stated that their truck

started before Fazar Azan and when they reached by

the side of Tejgaon Airport, Lieutenant Hasan

directed them not to allow movement of any vehicle

on the road. He further stated that thereafter he came

to know that the appellant and other co-accused

were involved in the incident. The appellant did not



challenge the statement of this witness in any

manner.



220. PW 34 a Subedar of Papa Battery of Two

Field Antillery of which the appellant was the

commander, said on 14th August night training he

was present and that their unit moved with six guns

to new airport via Chairman Bari and at about 10-00

PM he heard sounds of firing of gun under Mohi-

uddin (Antillery) near the gun area and that at about

2-30 AM they were made to fall-in again and

thereafter they boarded in a vehicle and proceeded

towards the Science Laboratory via Mohakhali and

from there their vehicle turned towards northern

side and approached through the Mirpur Road and

thereafier, the vehicle Stopped in front of a lake and

at that time the appellant was standing behind the

gun. The troops were directed not to allow anybody



to move on the road. The appellant did not challenge

the statement of this witness,



221. PW 35 corroborated PW 34 and

that he was Subedar Major of the Papa Bang

Two Field Artillery of which the appettany 4"

commander and he narrated the night trainj, the

14th August in detail and stated that Captain Jat On

gir handed over the parade to the appellant an.

further stated that after the incident he queried ik le

force about the cause for killing of the President.

came to know that this appellant and other acer

persons were involved in the killing Of the Presia.

and his family members. The appellant did ent

challenge the statement of this witness, not



222, Onan analysis of the evidence on

it is seen that there are uncontroverted evid

record against the appellant Bazlul Huda about hic

participation in the killing of Sheikh Kamal and

Bangabandhu on 15th August. PWs 1, 4 and 6 dite

the eye-witness of the occurrence and they have

stated that Bazlul Huda shot to death Sheikh Kamal,

PW 4 further stated that Bazlul Huda along with

Major Nur shot to death the President. Besides these

3 witnesses, PWs 5 and 7 recognised Bazlul Huda at

the time of occurrence at Bangabandhu’s house.

This appellant was also seen by PWs 11, 21 and 22

at the night parade, wherefrom he along with others

came to the house of President and killed Sheikh

Kamal and also the President. So there is direct

complicity of this appellant in the incident of 15th

August, 1975 and the learned Judges of the High

Court are perfectly justified in finding him guilty of

the charge of murder.





223. In respect of the charge of murder

levelled against appellant Farook Rahman, PWs I!

and 12 recognised him at the night parade where-

from he along with his force marched towards

Dhanmondi and thereafter he was seen at the gate of

Bangabandhu’s house at or about the time of

occurrence with a tank and talked with Bazlul Huda,

Mohiuddin (Lancer), Major Noor and others, then

when he was confirmed about the death of the

President and other members of his family, left the

place of occurrence. The evidence of these witnes-

ses sufficiently proved that this appellant was also

involved in the occurrence and the learned Judges of

the High Court Division are perfectly justified in

finding his complicity in the murder.



            
 224. As regards Mohiuddin (Lancer), it is

seen that PWs 4 and S saw him while he was enter.

OO ab the house of the President by fiting. PW 4

ve stated that he saw while this appellant Was

fart! ° Rangabandhu down the stairs Bazlul Huda

ee Noor shot him dead. Besides these two

and acces, PW 11 saw him at the gate of the house

onl President at or about the time of occurrence

pW 12 saw him while he was getting down from

$0 rack at the entry point of Road No.32 just

pe F the occurrence. Besides these Witnesses, PWs

5 wl 22 saw him while they were dropped at the

2 ing point of road No.32. Therefore, I find that

7 iearned Judge of the High Court Division have

x gly found his complicity in the incident of 15th

poust, 1975. In respect of the charge appellant Sul-

nh ;ahriar PW 14 proved his presence at the night

 on 14th August at Balurghat and his compli-

wav in the occurrence have been stated while discus-

sing the evidence of PW 14.





225. As regards the appellant Mohiuddin

(Antillery) PWs 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32, 34

end 35 proved as regards his presence at the night

parade wherefrom the troops of his unit marched to

Kelabagan Lake Circus playground, and set up

cennon aiming at Bangabandhu’s house and the

Rekshibahini Headquarter. The witnesses proved

that 2s per his order, his troops fired 4 rounds of

cemon-ball from Kalabagan play ground aiming at

the house of the President and Rakshibahini

Headquarter. This appellant did not deny the state-

ment of this witness. In view of this evidence on

record it cannot be said that there is no sufficient

materials on record to implicate this appellant in the

occurrence of 15th August, 1975. No exception

could be inferred from this act of participation in the

night parade and the first learned J udge also did not

take any exception even after he was recognised at

Kalabagan play ground with cannons and firing

cannon-balls aiming at the house of the President

and Rakshibahini Headquarter at the time of occur-

rence. In the premises there is no doubt that this

appellant was involved in the occurrence and helped

the other co-accused to commit the carnage. The

second and the Third learned Judges are perfectly

Justified in finding his complicity in the occurrence.





226. It may also be mentioned here that all the

above prosecution witnesses are army personnel of

Lancer and Artillery units and the appellants and

other co-accused served in those units. The defence

failed to show any enmity with them or their motive

to depose against them in support of the prosecution

case. The defence also failed to shake their testi-

Monies in any manner rather, they virtually admitted

their participation in the incident of murder by not

challenging the testimonies of those witnesses

relating to material particulars. All of them are

neutral and trustworthy witnesses. There is no

Cogent ground to discard their testimonies. The

second and the Third learned Judges of the High

Court Division and as well as learned Sessions

Judge have believed them as independent and reli-

able witness. The first learned Judge also believed

PWs 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 25, while

believing the complicity of Bazlul Huda, Mohi-

uddin’s (Lancer), Farook Rahman and Sultan

Shahriar but disbelieved PWs 16, 17, 18, 21, 22. 24.

25, 26, 27, 32, and 35 while disbelieving about

Mohiuddin (Artillery) complicity in the occurrence.

The finding of the first learned Judge that “the

presence of the convict with CO at parade was part

of duty and that parade in the night of 14th August

was held as per preexisting practice as seen from the

evidence of PWs 44 and 45 are based upon piece-

meal consideration of the evidence of PWs 44 and

45. The first leamed Judge failed to consider the

admitted fact that the appellants along with others

hatched up conspiracy at the parade ground, took

ammunition from the kote, removed heavy artillery

from the cantonment, deployed the troops with

artillery at key points and thereafter they killed the

President and other members of his family as

discussed earlier.



227. Now the question is, whether a finding

as to whether a witness is reliable or independent as

arrived at by the trial Court and the High Court Divi-

sion is a finding of fact and this finding is binding

on this Court and must be accepted as final? The

case of Nurul Islam [43 DLR (AD) 6) referred by the

Counsels of the appellant, leave was granted to

consider the glaring inconsistency and discrepancy

in the evidence of four eye-witnesses, PWs 1, 3, 7

and 8 which cast a doubt as to the truth of the prose-

cution case. The Appellate Division on assessing



            
their evidence found it difficult to rely upon them

and observed that the learned Judges of the High

Court Division did not consider the material discre-

pancy of these eye-witnesses while maintaining the

conviction and sentence. Therefore, this decision

referred by the learned Counsel is not applicable in

this case.



228. In the case of Hazrat Ali (54 DLR 636),

also referred by Counsels of the appellant, it has

been observed that when the evidence of witnesses

is dishelieved by the Court in respect of a major part

of the prosecution case regarding the involvement of

the accused persons the testimony of those witnes-

ses cannot be accepted without independent corro-

boration from other sources. The observations made

by the High Court Division in that case is not

disputed. In the present appeals the learned Counsel

failed to point out any major contradiction in the

evidence of the witnesses so as to disbelieve them in

respect of the majority part of the prosecution case.





229. The leamed Counsel for the appellants



also referred in the case of Muslimuddin [38 DLR

(AD) 311] wherein the appellants were convicted for

the charge of murder relying upon the evidence of

the deceased wife Majeda (PW 1) which is corrobo-

rated by PW 3 another eye-witness but she was

examined by the police Jong after the occurrence.

The High Court Division maintained his conviction.

The Appellate Division on consideration of the

evidence of PW J, the wife of the deceased, found

that she was present in the hut at the time of occur-

rence but she was not corroborated by other wit-

nesses, and it was totally improbable on her part to

recognise so many accused persons with detailed

description. In that case this Division observed;



“In a criminal trial determination of a

disputed fact is the main task before the Court

and Such determination js dependent upon

consideration of answers given by prosecution

witnesses in their cross-examination, Cross-

examination is therefore, indispensably neces-

sary to bring out desirable facts of a case modi-

fying the examination in-chief or establishing

the cross-examiner’s Own case. The object of

cross-examination is two-fold, to bring out the

case of the party Cross-examining and {

Impeach the credibility of the Witness I,

examination in-chief the witness discloses on}

those facts which are favourable to the Party

examining him and does not disclose the

necessary facts which go in favour of the other

side. Cross-examination in a criminal case aims

at extraction of the facts which support the

defence version which is very often sought to

be supported by the prosecution. The opponents

can of course establish facts favourable to them

by calling their own witnesses, but “there js

some thing dramatic in proving one’s own case

from the mouth of the witnesses of the

opponent.” As observed earlier, in the present

appeals, the defence did not challenge the

incriminating part of the material evidence

adduced by the witnesses and therefore, their

evidence remained uncontroverted. The

defence failed to establisl: facts favourable to

them by cross-examining tlie witnesses. There-

fore, this decision instead of helping the

defence helps the prosecution case.



230. In the case of Safdar Ali vs Crown [5

DLR (FC) 107(64)] referred by the appellants it has

been observed that in a criminal case, it is the duty

of the Court to review the entire evidence that has

been produced by the prosecution and the defence

and if, after examination of the whole evidence, the

Court is of the opinion that there is a reasonable

possibility that the defence put forward by the

accused must be true and it is clear that such a view

reacts on the whole prosecution, in such circum-

stances, the accused is entitled to get benefit of

doubt, not as a matter of grace, but as of right,

because the prosecution has not proved its case

beyond reasonable doubt.



231. The above statement of law is not

disputed being the established principle of law in the

administration of criminal justice. But in the present

appeals the defence version put forwarded by the

appellants does not affect the prosecution case,

rather supports the prosecution case.



232. Further in the case of Moyezuddin [31

DLR (AD) 37] it has been observed as follows:



“We like to observe that the contradiction



in the statement of a witness, either with his

own statement.





            
witnwss is a task of appreciation of the evidence

and therefore, it is within the jurisdiction

of the trial Court and the Court of appeal on

fact, to deal with the question. No doubt there is

certain Tule of prudence governing the case of

contradicting statements. It is first to be seen

whether the alleged statement is a discrepant

statement or contradictory statement. The

discrepant statement  one Which is either irrele-

vant oF incoherent, but it is not irreconcilable, A

giscrepant statement is not fatal to the eredibi-

lity of a witness, A contradictory statement is

one which is conflicting and is not reconcilable

with other statements either of his own or any

other witness. The question in such case is, that

it is open to a Court of fact either to reject the

whole evidence of a witness as untrustworthy or

to reject the contradictory part as unreliable or

to rely upon that portion, which in the opinion

of the Court, fits in with other evidence and the

facts and circumstances of the case.”





233. Accordingly what Mr Mamun argued

inpointing on certain portions of the evidence of

he Witnesses regarding the presence of Major

pazlul Huda at the place of occurrence and his

identification by the witnesses which are minor in

nature not to speak of even discrepant statement.

The leaned Counsel failed to point out any contra-

dictory statements of any witness, rather he avoided

our query as to whether the incriminating statements

made by the witnesses about the complicity of

Bazlul Huda had been challenged in course of cross-

examination.



234. Further, earlier, the question of consi-

dering such issues of fact in these appeals under

Article 103(3) of the Constitution has already been

discussed. Regarding the charge made against

nan Shahriar under sections 302/34 of the Penal

Code.



235. Md Abdur Razaque Khan, submitted that

Sultan Shahriar was not present at or about the place

of occurrence and in the absence of any overt act or

his participation in the incident of killing with the

other accused persons, his conviction under sections

302/34 is totally illegal and in order to bring Sultan

Shahriar within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal

Code some overt act or acts on his part relating to

the incident must be established to lead to the infer-

ence that he has participated with the participators in

the crime in preconcerted or pre-arranged plan and

except the evidence of PW 14 that he saw him at the

parade ground at Balurghat, there is no other corro-

borating evidence on record that he was in any way

Involved in the alleged occurrence and further the

presence of Sultan Shahriar at the Radio Station at

or around 6-00 AM on 15th August after the

occurrence was part of his official duty, for which,

he cannot be saddled with the charge of murder. Mr

Razaque Khan further submitted that since Sultan

Shahriar was not present at House No.677 of Road

No.32 and has not actively participated in the

murder his act cannot justifiably be held guilty for

the offence committed by other principal offenders

and his act at best attracts an offence of abetment of

murder punishable under section 109 of the Penal

Code as held in the cases of Md Shamsul Hoque vs

State 20 DLR 540, Amor Kumar Thakur vs State 40

DLR (AD) 147, Hazrat Ali vs State 44 DLR (AD) 51

and Dharan Pal vs State of Haryana 1978) 4 SCC

440.



236. Mr Khan further submitted that con-

viction in the charge of conspiracy could not be

given after the conspiracy has borne its fruits.



237. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, submitted that

Farook Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) were not

found present in House No.677 at Road No.32 and

that there is also no nexus between the deployment

of artillery troops at Kalabagan play ground by

Mohiuddin (Artillery) and the killing of President

and the members of his family and therefore both of

them have been illegally convicted under sections

302/34 of the Penal Code and further if the offence

committed is found to be a mutiny which being a

military offence, the provisions of sections 34 or

section 38 of the Penal Code as regard common

intention and the responsibility arising therefrom,

will have no manner of application in the present



appeals.



238. Mr Anisul Huq and the Advocate-Gene-

ral, on the other hand, submitted that even if it is

assumed that section 34 is not applicable in respect

of Sultan Shahriar this would however be of little

practical benefit to him because his participation in

the criminal conspiracy to implement the object has





            
been established by the prosecution. It was further

contended by Mr Huq that section 120A being an

independent offence, order of conviction and sen-

tence may be passed in respect of Sultan Shahriar

under section 120B of the Penal Code.



239. To meet the points of common intention

and the responsibility arising therefrom, the true

purports of sections 34, 35 and 38, which read as

follows, are to be examined.



“34. When a criminal act is done by several

persons, in furtherance of the common intention

ofall, each of such persons is liable for that act in

the same manner as if it were done by him alone.



35. Whenever an act, which is criminal only

by reason of its being done with a criminal

knowledge or intention, is done by several

persons, each of such persons who joins in the

act with such knowledge or intention is liable for

the act in the same manner as if the act were done

by him alone with that knowledge or intention.



38. Where several persons are engaged or

concemed in the commission of a criminal act,

they may be guilty of different offences by

means of that act.”



240. A reading of these provision shows that

sections 34 and 35 create responsibility for the total

result while section 38 creates individual responsi-

bility only. Section 34 applies where there is a com-

mon intention and for a criminal act done in further-

ance of common intention of all, everyone is equally

responsible. Section 35 requires the existence of the

knowledge or intent in each accused before he can

be held liable if knowledge or intent is necessary to

make the act criminal, Thus, if two persons beat a

Third and one intent to cause his death and the other

to cause only grievous injury and there is no com-

mon intention, their offences will be different. This

would not be the case if the offence is committed

with a common intention or each accused possesses

the necessary intention or knowledge. Section 38



provides for different degrees of responsibility

arising from the same kind of act.



241.



Following illustrations will clear the

point :





A attacks Z under such circumstances, 5

grave provocation that his killing of Z Would

only culpable homicidal not amounting to mu.

der. B having ill-will towards Z and intendint

to kill him, and not having been subject to the

provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though

A and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death

B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of

culpable homicide.



242. A criminal intention within the Meaning

of section 34 is simultaneous conscientiousness of

minds of persons participating in the criminal action

to bring such particular result and if one facilitates

the execution of the common design such Person

commits an act as much as his CO-participants

actually committing the planned crime. The essence

of section is that the person must be Physically

present at the actual commission of the crime. This

must be coupled with actual participation, which

may be of passive character such as standing by a

door or near about the incident with the intention of

assisting in furtherance of common intention of all

the accused and with a readiness to play his pant

when the time comes for him to act.



243. Now the question is, what will be result

if the above principles are applied to the facts of the

present appeals?



244. As stated earlier, the appellants attended

the night parade, and it was organised to fulfil and

implement their object. The appellants and other

accuseds deployed jawans under the command of

officers at key points such as, Rakhibahini Head-

quarter, BDR Headquarter, Radio Station, Minto

Road. and Road No. 32 .This deployment of army at

Rakhibahini Headquarter and BDR Headquarter

was a part of their pre-plan to prevent these para-

military forces to come forward to protect the

President in case of any information or help was

sought for, The deployment at the Radio Station was

for preventing any person on behalf of the Gover

ment to seek any help from the army, navy, air force.

paramilitary forces, political activists or from other

sources. The deployment at Minto Road was also !0

prevent the Ministers to mobilise the public or any

other force for the protection of the President.



            
245. The records show that Mohiuddin (Artillery

) was deputed with cannon at Kalabagan play-

ler? nd near Road No, 32, Sultan Shahriar was

gt" ad at the Radio Station, Farook Rahman came

7 ; Rakhibahini Headquarter to the house of the

In gent, Mohiuddin (Lancer), Bazlul Huda and

hie other officers were given the main task of

ementing the main object of killing the Presi-

t and the members of his family, The movement

den appellants with arms and cannons at different

of the sints was a part of the criminal conspiracy to

vit Pe common design of killing the President

his family members Without any interruption.

qzlur Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) actively par-

jpated in the killing. Farook Rahman as it appears

though did not join in the Killing but his presence

near the house of the President with a tank at the

‘me of killing was in furtherance of common inten-

tion of all of them to implement the act and with that

end in view to resist others to come in the way of

implementing their ultimate goal and though his

participation was passive and diverse but he was

resent at or about the place of occurrence. Mohi-

yddin (Artillery) aided co-accuseds Bazlul Huda,

Mohiuddin (Lancer) and others by way of guarding

the house of the President with his troops and can-

non from Kalabagan playground with the motive

that if force come forward to rescue the President he

would resist them, and with that object he fired four

cannon balls letting others to know that he was pre-

pared to use the cannon-balls. Thus, actions of

Faruque Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) come

within the ambit of section 34 as they were ready to

participate in the crime in case of necessity.





246. Regarding Sultan Shahriar, admittedly

he was not present at the place of occurrence and he

was deployed at the Radio Station from before the

time of occurrence. As stated earlier, his task was

also to prevent anyone from seeking help through

the Radio Station. So question arises whether his act

falls within the ambit of section 34 since he was not

physically present at the place of occurrence? The

leamed Judges of the High Court Division were of

the view that he shared the common intention with

other accused persons, although his participation

Was Not active, it was passive, which act also fell

Within the ambit of section 34. The first learned

Tudge observed that besides being present at the

night parade, his presence at the Radio Station was

part of the said agreement that he entered into agree-

ment with other convicts for the purpose of causing

the incident in the house of the President. The sec-

ond learned Judge also noticed his presence at the

Radio Station about 4-30/5-00 AM and expressed

similar views. The learned Judges considered the

cases of Barendra Kumar Ghose vs Emperor, AIR

1925 (PC) 1, Shreekantiah Ramayya Muni Palli, vs

State of Bombay AIR 1955 SC 287, Tukaram

Gonapat vs State of Maharashtra AIR 1974 SC 5] 4,

Ramaswami vs State of TN AIR 1976 SC 2027,

Abdur Rahman Mandol vs State, 29 DLR (SC) 247,

Bangladesh vs Abed Ali, 36 DLR (AD) 234, Abdus

Samad vs State 44 DLR (AD) 233 and State vs Tajul

Islam 48 DLR 305 in coming to their conclusion.



247. As observed earlier, the dominant feature

of section 34 of the Penal Code is the element of

participation is actions. This participation need not

in all cases be by physical presence. Common inten-

tion implies acting in concert. This section requires

that there must be a general intention shared by all

the persons united with a common pur- pose to do

any criminal offence, all of those who assist in the

accomplishment of the object would be equally

guilty. It follows, therefore, that common intention

is an intention to commit a crime actually commit-

ted and every one of the accused should have par-

ticipated in that infention.



248. In Barendra, Kumar Ghosh 5.,.case,

(supra) their Lordships of the Privy Council have

clearly expounded the principles animated in the.

section. In that case three men fired at the post mas-

ter, of whom Barendra Kumar, the appellant, was

one. He wore distinctive clothes by which he could

be and was identified; and while these men were just

inside the room, another was visible from the room

through the door standing close to the others but just

outside on the doorstep in the Court- yard. This man

was armed but did not fire. The defence of Barendra

was that he was the man outside the room, that he

stood in the Courtyard and was very much fright-

ened, Whether he was present as one of the firing

party or as its commander or as its reserve or its sen-

tinel was of no special importance on the case made

for the Crown. Why he was there at all and why he

did not take himself off again he did not say, nor did



            
he even indicate his precise position in the yard,

Their Lordships while maintaining the conviction of

Barendra expounded the ambit of section 34 as fol-

lows :



“Ry section 33 a criminal act in section 34

includes a series of acts and, further “act

includes omission to act, for example, an omis-

sion to interfere in order to prevent a murder

being done before one’s very eyes. By section

37, when any offence is committed by means of

several acts Whoever intentionally cooperates in

the commission of that offence by doing any

one of those acts, either singly or jointly with

any other person, commits that offence. Even if

the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the

door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in

other things “they also serve who only stand

and wait.” By section 38 when several persons

are engaged or concerned in the commission of

a criminal act, they may be guilty of different

offences by means of that act. Read together,

these sections are reasonably plain. Section 34

deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or

diverse by several persons; if all are done in fur-

therance of a common intention, each person is

liable for the result of them all, as ifhe had done

them himself for “that act” and “the act” in the

latter part of the section must include the whole

action covered by “a criminal act” in the first

part, because they refer to it.”



249. Therefore, the dominant feature of sec-

tion 34 is the element of participation in action, this

participation need not be in all cases by physical

presence. The Supreme Court of India has distin-

guished the cases in which the physical presence of

the accused person at the place of incident is pre-

requisite and in which cases the physical presence of

the accused was not necessary-his participation by

doing separate acts similar or diverse would bring

him within the ambit of the section .



250. In the case of Ramaswami (supra) it has

been observed, section 34 is to be read along with

the preceding section 33 which makes it clear that

the “act” spoken of in section 34 includes a series of

acts as a single act. It follows that the words “when

a criminal act is done by several persons”. So sec-

tion 34, may be construed to mean “when criminal

acts are done by several persons.” The acts com,

mitted by different confederates in the Criminal

action may be different but all must in one way o,

the other participate and engage in the criminal

enterprise. For instance, one may only stand guard

to prevent any person coming to the relief of the Vic-

tim or to otherwise facilitate the execution of the

common design. Such a person also commits ap

“act” as much as his co-participants actually commit.

ting the planned crime. In the case of an offence

involving physical violence, however, it is essential

for the application of section 34 that the person who

instigates or aids the commission of the crime must,

be physically present at the actual commission of

the crime for the purpose of facilitating or prompt.

ting the offence, the commission of which is the aim

of the joint criminal venture. Such presence of those

who in one way or the other facilitate the execution

of the common design, is itself tantamount to actual

participation in the ‘criminal act.’ The essence of

section 34 is simultaneous consensus of the minds

of persons participating in the criminal action to

bring about a particular result. Such consensus can

also be developed at the spot and thereby intended

by all of them.



251. In the case of Sreekantiah (supra) it was

observed :



“The essence of section 34 that the person

must be physically present at the scene of occur-

rence coupled with actual participation which,

of course, can be of a passive character such as

standing by a door, provided that is done with

the intention of assisting in furtherance of com-

mon intention of them all and there is a readi-

ness to play his part in the prearranged plan

when the time comes for him to act”. A five-

member Bench of this Court also took similar

view in Abdur Rahman Mondal’s case (supra)

as follows :



“The common intention to bring about a

particular result may well develop on the spot

as between a number of persons. All that is

necessary is either to have direct proof of prior co”

cert or proof of circumstances which necessarily

ily lead to that inference or the incriminating

acts must be incompatible with the innocence .

the accused and incapable of explanation on



            
any other reasonable hypothesis. Further, it is

the essence of section 34 that the person must

be physically present at the actual commission

of the crime.”



252. In the case of Rasool Bux vs State 22

pLR (SC) 297 the Supreme Court of Pakistan

roved the views taken in the case of Barendra

St Ghosh and considered the case in the light of

observations made by their Lordships of the

a Council. In that case accused Lal Bux and

asul Bux planned to abduct Mst. Roshna from the

pouse of her father, if necessary, by the use of force.

They were both armed with deadly weapons. When

their presence was discovered in the Courtyard they

gbandoned their original plan but were nevertheless

getermined to escape, if necessary, by use of

weapons carried by them. It was observed this

“common intention though originally not present

wes formed at the spur of the moment when they

found themselves being surrounded by persons

attracted to the place.......... ”. Lal Bux fired at the

person Who was ahead of those coming to prevent

their escape and Rasul Bux also fired two shots . It

was further observed that they “fired with the com-

mon intention of preventing the interceptors from

cutting of their escape. It is difficult, therefore, to

appreciate how it can be said that they were not act-

ing in furtherance of the common intention of them

both.”



253. In Tajul Islam’s case (supra) the High

Court Division noticed the evidence produced by

the prosecution in support of charge that Badsha in

his confession stated that he pressed the legs of sec:

ond son of Biroja Rani, and accused Inu cut him into

two pieces by a dao. Other confessing accused stat-

ed that for the purpose of committing the offence

they went to the house of Biroja and were on guard

either in the boat or in front of the door of neigh-

bours of Biroja or on the road leading to the house

of Biroja presumably to prevent any person from

coming in the way of their committing the offence.

In the facts of the case the learned Judges observed

as follows:



“In offence involving physical viol

normally presence at the scene of the 0

tence of the offender sought to be rend

liable on the principle of joint liability ness-

sary; such is not the case in respect of other

offences where offence consists of adverse acts

Which may be done at a different time and

place.”



254. In the case of Noor Mohammad Md

Yusuf Momin vs State of Maharashtra (supra), the

trial Court convicted Md Taki Haji Hussain Momin

under section 302 and acquitted three other accused

including the appellant. On appeal against acquittal,

the Bombay High Court reversed the acquittal and

convicted the appellant and two others under sec-

tions 120B and 302 read with section 34, IPC. The

appellant was also convicted under sections

302/109, IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life

on two counts separately. The appellant’s conviction

under sections 302/34, IPC was set aside on the fol-

lowing observations:



“From the evidence it seems highly prob-

able that at the time of the actual murder of

Mohd. Yahiya the appellant was either present

with other three co-accused or was somewhere

nearby. But this evidence does not seem to be

enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt his

presence at the spot in the company of the other

accused when the murder was actually commit-

ted ..... we are, therefore, inclined to give to the

appellant the benefit of doubt in regard to the

charge under section 302 read with section 34,

IPC.”



255. The application of section 34 in respect

of the offences other than physical violence have

been explained in Tukaram Ganpats case (supra)

wherein the facts against the accused including the

appellant Tukaram were that they stole some bun-

dles of copper wire from the godown of a company

after breaking open the godown and removed them

by a lorry which stopped at a weigh-bridge Where

the brokers for sale were present, There was no evi-

dence about the presence of the appellant at the

scene of offence. The concurrent findings of the

Courts below were that the appellant was in posses-

sion of duplicate keys of the burgled godown found

missing from the factory and that he was present at

the weigh bridge. The appellant had no explanation

for possessing of godown keys nor for his presence

at weigh-bridge. In the context of the matter me

Supreme Court maintained the conviction of the



            
appellant on applying the principles of common

intention as under:

“Mere distance from the scene of crime

cannot exclude culpability under section 34

which laws down the rule of joint responsibility

for a criminal act performed by a plurality of

persons. In Barendra Kumar Ghosh vs King

Emperor (1924) 52 JA 40-(AIR 1925 PC 1) the

Judicial Committee drew into the criminal net

thase ‘who only stand and wait.’. This does not

mean that some form of presence, near or

remote, is not necessary, or that mere presence

without more, at the spot of crime, spells culpa-

bility . Criminal sharing, overt or covert, by

active presence or by distant direction, making

out a certain measure of jointness in the com-

mission of the act is the essence of section 34.

Even assuming that presence at the scene is a

pre-requisite to attract section 34 and that such

propinguity is absent. section 107 which is dif-

ferent in one sense, still comes into play to rope

in the accused. The act here is not the picking

the godown Jock but housebreaking and crimi-

nal house trespass. This crime is partici- pated

in by those operating by remote control as by

those doing physical removal.. Together operat-

ing in concert, the criminal project is executed.

Those who supply the duplicate key, wait at the

weigh bridge for the break-in and bringing of

the booty and later secrete the keys are par-

ticipes criminil,



256. And this is the role of accused No.2 according to the Courts below. Could this legal interface be altogether untenable?



257. The above decision discussed the prin-

ciples of joint liability, mere distance from the scene

of crime cannot exclude culpability under section 34

of the Penal Code in criminal sharing making out a

certain measure of jointness in the commission of

the act. However the learned Judges of the High

Court Division failed to appreciate the ratio deci-

dendi of the above decisions regarding the presence

of appellant, Sultan Shahriar, | am accord- ingly of

the view that the prosecution is required to prove the

Presence of Sultan Shahriar and his Parti- cipation in

the commission of the offence in fur- therance of the

common intention of all in order to bring his offence

within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal Code buy

failed,



258. Regarding the submission that conviction

 of the charge of conspiracy could not be Liven

after the conspiracy has borne fruit, as it appears in

Shamsul Hoque’ case, following the case reportey

in AIR 1938 Mad 130 which was also followed in 4

DLR 48, it was observed that where an offence is

alleged to have been committed by two or more per.

sons, the person responsible for commission of the

offence should be charged with the substantive

offence, while the persons alleged to have abetted it

by conspiracy should be charged with the offence of

abetment under section 109. As it appears views

taken in AJR 1938 Mad 130 which was follows in g

DLR 48 have been overruled in Kandimally

Subbaiah's case (AIR 1961 SC 1241 (paras 7 and 8),

The facts and the principles of law involved in Amar

Kumar Thakur s case are quite distinguishable since

the offence charged against the accused is under sec-

tions 302/34, in which, this Court found no legal

evidence that the “appellants No.2-4 had any inten-

tion of their own to cause the death of Nandalal, par-

ticularly when he was proceeding at their request to

hold the mediation at that hour of the night.”



259. In Hazrat Ali's case, the Appellate Divi-

sion on assessment of the evidence on record came

to the conclusion that Hazrat Ali abetted the offence

of murder of Zahura Khatun and accordingly con-

verted his conviction to 302/109 from an offence of

302/34,



260, In Dharam Pal’s case, it was observed

that the existence or otherwise of the common inten-

tion depends upon the facts and circumstances of

each case, and in the absence of materials, “the com-

panion or companions cannot justifiably be held

guilty for every offence committed by the principal

offender.” The facts of the above cases are quite dis-

tinguishable from the present case.



261. As it appears that there is no substantial

difference between conspiracy as defined in section

120A and acting on a common intention as conte”

plated in section 34. In the former the gist for the

offence is bare agreement and association to break

law even though illegal act does not follow while

the gist of an offence under.section 34 is the commision



            
mission of a criminal act in furtherance of a com-

mon intention of all the offenders which means that

there should be a unity of criminal behaviour result-

‘ag in something for which an individual will be

punishable if it is done by himself alone,



262. Sub-section (1) of section 120B imposes

a penalty equal to the punishment for abetment on

articipation in criminal conspiracy to commit an

offence: The section appears to have been intro-

guced 10 fill up the gap in section 107 defining

gbetment. Under section 107 “secondly” provides

that a person abets the doing of a thing who engages

with others in a conspiracy for doing of that thing if

an act OT illegal omission takes place in pursuance of

that conspiracy. Abetment of an offence is punish-

able under sections 109 and 116 as the case may be,

if the offence is not committed; but it is clear that a

conspiracy will not amount to an abet- ment unless

anact or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of

the conspiracy. Therefore, the first class of cases

which section 120B is designed to cover, is that in

which the conspiracy is formed for the commission to

a serious offence. But no act or illegal omission has

taken place in present appeals. Section 120A provides

the extended definition of criminal conspiracy cover-

ing acts which do not amount to abetment by con-

spiracy within the meaning of section 107; Section

120B provides punishment for criminal conspiracy

where no express provision is made in the Penal Code

for the punishment of such conspiracy.



263. In the case of Noor Mohammad Mohol

Yusuf Momin (Supra) the distinctive features of sec-



tions 34, 107 and 120B have been explained as fol-

lows:



“So far as section 34, Indian Penal Code is

concerned, it embodies the principle of joint lia-

bility in the doing of a criminal act, the essence

of that liability being the existence of a com-

mon intention. Participation in the commis-

sion of the offence in furtherance of the com-

mon intention invites its application, Section

109. Indian Penal Code, on the other hand, may

be attracted even if the abettor is not present

when the offence abetted is committed provid-

ed that he has instigated the commission of the

offence or has engaged with one or more other



Persons in a conspiracy to commit an offence





and pursuant to that conspiracy some act or

illegal omission takes place or has intentionally

aided the commission of an offence by an act or

illegal omission. Turning to the charge under

section 120B. Indian Penal Code, criminal con-

spiracy was made a substantive offence in 1913

by the introduction of chapter V-A in the Indian

Penal Code. Criminal conspiracy postu- lates an

agreement between two or more per- sons to do,

or cause to be done, an illegal act or an act

which is not illegal, by illegal means. It differs

from other offences in that mere agreement ts

made an offence even if no step is taken to carry

out that agreement. Though there is close asso-

ciation of conspiracy with incite- ment and

abetment the substantive offence of criminal

conspiracy is somewhat wider in am- plitude

than abetment by conspiracy as contem- plated

its very nature is generally hatched in secret. It

is, therefore, extremely rare that direct evidence

in proof of conspiracy can be forth- coming

from wholly disinterested quarters or from utter

strangers. But, like other offences, criminal

conspiracy can be proved by circum- stantial

evidence. In- deed, in most cases proof of con-

spiracy is largely inferential though the infer-

ence must be founded on solid facts. Sur-

rounding circumstances and antecedent and

subsequent conduct, among other factors, cons-

titute relevant material. In fact, because of the

difficulties in having direct evidence of crimi-

nal conspiracy, once reasonable ground is

shown for believing that two or more persons

have conspired to commit an offence then any-

thing, done by anyone of them in reference to

their common intention after the same is enter-

tained becomes, according to the law of evi-

dence, relevant for proving both conspiracy and

the offences ‘committed pursuant thereto. ”



264. Inthe case of State of Ahdhra Pradesh vs

Kandimalla Subbaiah AIR 1961 SC 1241 the point

for consideration was whether an offence is said to

have been committed in consequence of abetment,

when it has been committed in pursuance of the con-

spiracy, and the abettor by conspiracy can be made

punishable with the punishment provided for the

actual offence. The Supreme Court replied to the

point as under:



            
“Conspiracy to commit an offence is itself

an offence and a person can be separately

charged within respect to such a conspiracy.

There is no analogy between section 120B and

section 109 IPC There may be an element of

abetment in a conspiracy; but conspiracy is

something more than an abetment. Offences

created by sections 109 and 120B, IPC are quite

distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the

one element of conspiracy,

prosecution to only consation is that



that is, abetment when the allegal

what a person did was something over and

above that. Where a number of offences are

committed by several persons in pursuance ofa

conspiracy it is usual to charge them with those

offences as well as with the offence of conspi-



racy to commit those offence.”



265. Later on in the case of the State of

Andhra Pradesh vs Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao

AIR. 1963 SC 1850 it has been observed:



“The offence of conspiracy is an entirely

independent offence and though other offences

are committed in pursuance of the conspiracy

the liability of the conspirators for the conspi-

racy itself cannot disappear. In the Indian Penal

Code, as originally enacted, conspiracy was not

an offence. Section 120B, which makes crimi-

nal conspiracy punishable, was added by the

Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1913

(VIII of 1913) along with section 120A. Section

120A defines conspiracy and section 120B pro-

vides for the punishment for the offence of con-

spiracy. Criminal conspiracy as defined in sec-

tion 120A consists of an agreement to do an

illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is

not illegal by illegal means, Section 120B pro-

vides that whoever is a party to a conspiracy to

commit an offence punishable with death,

imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment

for a term of two years or upwards shall be pun-

ishable in the same manner as if he has abetted

such offence unless there was an express provi-

sion in the Code for the punish- ment of such

conspiracy. Criminal conspiracy was, however,

not an unknown thing before the amendment of

the Indian Penal Code in 1913. But what the

amendment did was to make that conspiracy

itself punishable. The idea was to prevent, the

commission of crimes by, so to speak, nippy; e

them in the bud. But it does not follow ,



where crimes have been committed the liabitiy

to punishment already incurred under Section

120B by having entered into a criminal Conspip.

acy is thereby wiped away. No doubt, as alrea d



stated, where offences for committing Which ;

conspiracy was entered into have actually been

committed it may not, in the particular circum,

stances of a case, be desirable to charge the

offender both with the conspiracy and the

offences committed in pursuance of that con.

spiracy. But that would be a matter ultimately

within the discretion of the Court before which



the trial takes place.”



266. Accordingly, the appellants were duly

convicted under section 120B as well. On overal|

consideration of the evidence and the laws applica.

ble in this case I am of the view that the High Court

Division is justified in arriving at the conclu- sion

that the appellants and other accuseds hatched up

conspiracy to kill the President the members of his

family present in the house, and accomplished their

object by killing them and other three security per-

sonnel.







267. But however, in view of the discussion

made above, I am of the view that the legal convic-

tion of the appellants Farook Rahman, Mohiuddin

(Artillery), Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) and Bazlul

Huda should have been under section 302 read with

section 120B and section 34 of the Penal Code

instead of 302/34 of the Penal Code and the legal

conviction of Sultan Shahriar should have been

under sections 302/120B of the Penal Code.



268. Their convictions are modified accord-

ingly. The leaned Counsel of the appellants raising

the point of commuting of sentence submitted that

since the appellants have been in the death cell fora

long period, even this Division finds that the learned

Judges of the High Court Division have rightly

found the charges leveled against them, ends of jus-

tice demands that the sentence awarded to the appellants be reduced to imprisonment for life.



269. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned

Counsel, in this contention, referred a decision in



            
270. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun = the learned

scl, submitted that the appellants have been in

i] for a long time, this prolonged delay in

aving out a sentence of death after their sentence

; j been passed amounts to inhuman punishment

; torture and violative of fundamental rights

" anteed in Article 35(5) of the Constitution, inas-

at 3s under this provision provided that no per-

yall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman

sy parading punishment or treatment and so in

view of the principle laid down in the case of Pratt

s 4norney-General for Jamaica, (1993) 4 All ER

Henfield vs Attorney-General of

Common wealth of Bahamas, 3 WIR (PC) 1079 and

Guerra vs Baptiste (1995) 4 All ER 583, sentence of

jeath awarded to these appellants is liable to be

commuted to imprisonment for life, so sentence of

geath awarded to these appellants is liable to be



commuted to imprisonment for life.







271. Learned Attorney-General contends that

tae delay in concluding hearing of the appeal is not

dye to the laches of the State but it is in fact for the

latches of the accused appellants and further the

eccused persons including the appellants in a plan-

ned manner committed the heinous crime with their

knowledge of the consequences and therefore, they

do not deserve any special sympathy in awarding

the sentence.



272. Mr Anisul Hug however contended that

the appellants deserved extreme sentence since they

not only brutally killed the President of the country

who was also Father of the Nation but killed 3

“omen and a child and by their act they committed

“ime against humanity they also extinguished the

pedigree of the First Family in the country and they

did the same act with motive that nobody could take

any legal action in future against them. Accordingly

when the murder is committed in such extremely

wal and grotesque, diabolical, manner and when

Wome, of murder is an innocent child or a helpless

repect whom or a public figure generally loved and

proper ed by the community extreme sentence Is the

4s refs In this connection, the learned Counsel

Minh, tr the case of Machhi Singh vs State of



(1983) 3 Supreme Court Cases 470.





273. In order to satisfy ourselves we have

called for the records of the High Court Division

and perused the order sheet. We noticed that the

appellants never made any endeavour to dispose of

the appeals either in the High Court Division or in

the Appellate Division. It was the State that fre-

quently prayed for fixation of the death reference in

the High Court Division and on its prayer a Bench

Was constituted for hearing the death reference.

After the death reference was disposed of by the

High Court Division, the appellants after filing leave

petitions did not take any step for hearing of their

petitions. It was only on the prayer of the State that

the leave petitions were heard and the appeals were

also heard. Over and above, the appellant Md Bazlul

Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) remained in abscon-

sion in course of the trial of the case and at the time

of hearing of the death reference Mohiuddin

(Lancer), after many years, filed leave petitions with

a prayer for condonation of delay . The delay, in the

premises, was not due to the laches on the part of the

State. Since the condemned prisoners did not take

any steps for hearing of the death reference and their

appeals at any point of time, so they are not entitled

to submit that by reason of their detention in con-

demned cell they have been subjected to “torture or

to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treat-

ment. Further they also did not raise this point at any

point of time, rather from their conduct it is appar-

ent that they have tried to delay the disposal of the



appeal.



274. Originally sub-section (5) of or section

367 provided as follows:



“If the accused is convicted of an offence

punishable with death, and the Court sentenced

him to any punishment other than death, the

Court shall in its judgment state the reasons

why sentence of death was not passed.”



275. This shows that the imposition of death

sentence was the rule and the awarding of a lesser

sentence was an exception-discretion was directed

towards death penalty. This provision was however

substituted by Ordinance No.XLIX of 1978 with

effect from 1979 as follows:



“Section 367(5) provides that “if the

accused is convicted of an offence punishable



            




276.  The result of this amendment is that it was left to the discretion of the Court on the facts of each to pass a sentence of death or a lesser sentence. The Appellate Division in the case of Abul Khair vs State 44 DLR (AD) 225 held that delay itself is no extenuating circumstances to commute the sentence. The observations are as under:

    

      "Delay by itself in the execution of sentence of deatrh is by no means an extenuating circumtances for commuting the sentence of death to imprisonment for life. There must be other circumtances of a compelling nature which together with delay will merit such commutation. We find no compelling extenauting circumtances in this case and therefore, find no ground whatsoever to interfere.”



277. As it appears in India section 367(5) has

mite

2 in the Code of 1973. The correspondent

been reemactec



is provided in section 354(3) which



Section 354(3) When the conviction is for

2 sentence punishable with death or, in the alter-

native, with imprisonment for life or imprison-

ment for 2 term of years, the judgment shall

state the reasons for the sentence awarded, and,

in case of sentence of death, the special reason

for such sentence”.



278. Under this new provision life sentence is

now the rule and it is only in exceptional cases, for

special reasons to be assigned the death sentence

can be imposed. In the case of Jogmohan Singh vs

State of UP AIR 1973 SC 947 it has been observed

as follows:



“A large number of murders is undoubted-

ly of common type. But some at least are dia-

bolical in conception and cruel in execution. In

some other’s where the victim is a person of

high standing in the country society is liable to

be rocked to its very foundation. Such murders

cannot simply be whisked away by finding ali-

bis in the social maladjustment of the murderer

of such crimes speaks. in Opinion 

he inevitability of death panel.



279. In Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab, 4 

7980 SC &98 Bachan Singh was convicted and Sen.

tenced to death under section 302 for murder o¢

three persons. His sentence of death was confirm, -

by the Punjab High Court. His appeal by Special

Leave came up for hearing before a Division Benchan,

The leave was granted to consider whether the fac;

found by the Courts below would be ‘special rea-

sons’ for awarding the death sentence as requirement

under section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure 1973”. The Division Bench of the

Supreme Court referred the matter to 2

Constitutional Bench for a decision in regard to the

constitutional validity of death penalty for murders

provided in section 302 and the sentencing proce-

dure embodied in section 334(3) of the Code. The

Supreme Court by a majority maintained the sen-

tence of death observing as follows:



“Attuned to the legislative policy delineat-

ed in sections 354(3) and 235(2) propositions

(iv)(a) and (v) (b) in Jagmohan, shall have to be

recast and may be stated as below:



(a) The normal rule is that the offences of

murder shall be punished with the sentence of

life imprisonment. The Court can depart from

that rule and impose the sentence of death only

if there are special reasons for doing so. Such

reasons must be recorded in writing before

imposing the death sentence. (b) While consid-

ering the question of sentence to be imposed for

the offence of murder under section 302, Pen!

Code, the Court must have regard to every

evant circumstance relating to the crime as well

as the criminal. If the Court finds, but not oth-

erwise, that the offence is of an exceptionally

depraved and heinous character and constitutes

on account of its design and the manner of its

execution, a source of grave danger to the So

ety at large, the Court may impose the deat

sentence.”



280. In the case of Rajiv Gandhi the, ex-Prime

Minister of India, the Supreme Court of India while



            
maintaining of death sentence in accordance with

section 354(3) of the Code in the case of Nalini

(1999 3 SCC 253).



DP Wadhwa, J observed as :



“Cruelty of the crime committed has

known no bounds. The crime sent shock waves

in the country. General elections had to be post-

poned. It was submitted more than once that

principal perpetrators in the present case are

already dead but then for the support which

Nalini (A-1), Santhan (A-2), Murugan (A-3) and

Arivu (A-18) afforded for commission of the

crime it could not have been committed. Each

one of these four accused had a role to play.

Crime was committed after previous planning

and executed with extreme brutality. There were

as many as two dry runs as to how to reach Rajiv

Gandhi after penetrating the security cordon. A

former Prime Minister of the country was target-

ed because this country had entered an agree-

ment with a foreign country in exercise of its

sovereign powers. Rajiv Gandhi being the head

of the Government at that time was signatory to

the accord which was also signed by the head of

the Government of Sri Lanka. The Accord had

the approval of Parliament. It was not that Rajiv

Gandhi had entered into the Accord in his per-

sonal capacity or for his own benefit. Though we

have held that object of the conspiracy was not to

commit any terrorist act or any disruptive activi-

ty, nevertheless murder of a former Prime

Minister for what he did in the interest of the

country was an act of exceptional depravity on

the part of the accused, an unparalleled act in the

annals of crimes committed in this country. In a

mindless fashion not only was Rajiv Gandhi

killed but along with him others died and many

suffered grievous and simple injuries. It is not

that intensity of the belt bomb strapped on the

waist of Dhanu was not known to the conspira-



tors as after switching on the first switch on her

belt bomb Dhanu asked Sivarasan to move away.

Haribabu was so keen to have close-up pictures

of the crime that he met his fate in the blast itself.

We are unable to find any mitigating circum-

stance not (sic) to upset the award of sentence of

death on the accused.”





281. In the Indira Gandhi killing case being

Kehar Singh vs State, AIR 1988 SC 1883 similar

question was raised about the extreme sentence of

death in the context of section 354(3) of the Code of

1973. The Supreme Court of India maintained the

conviction of death sentence of Kehar Singh and

Satwant Singh. Ozha J observed as follows:



“Then is the question of sentence which

was argued to some extent. But it must be clear-

ly understood that it is not a case where X is

killed by Y on some personal ground for per-

sonal vendetta. The person killed is a lady and

no less than the Prime Minister of this country

who was the elected leader of the people. In our

country we have adopted and accepted a system

wherein change of the leader is permissible by

ballot and not by bullet. The act of the accused

not only takes away the life of popular leader

but also undermines our system which has been

working so well for the last forty years. There is

yet another serious consideration. Beant Singh

and Satwant Singh are persons who were post-

ed on the security duty of the Prime Minister.

They are posted there is protect her from any

intruder or from any attack from outside and

therefore if they themselves resort to this kind

of offence, there appears to be no reason or no

mitigating circumstance for consideration on

the question of sentence. Additionally, an

unarmed lady was attacked by these two per-

sons with a series of bullets and it has found

that a number of bullets entered her body. The

manner in which mercilessly she was attacked

by these 2 persons on whom the confidence was

reposed to give her protection repels any con-

sideration of reduction of sentence. In this view

of the matter, even the conspirator who inspired

the persons who actually acted does not deserve

any leniency in the matter of sentence. In our

opinion, the sentence awarded by the trial

COURT and maintained by the High Court

appears to be just and proper.”



282. In Machhi Singh’s case (supra) the

Supreme Court of India, after classifying the cases

in which death penalty may be imposed, calculated

as follows:



            
When the victim of murder is (a) an inno-

cent child who could not have or has not pro-

vided even an eXcUse, much less a provocation,

for murder (b) a helpless woman OF a person

rendered helpless by old age or infirmity (c)

when the victim is a person vis-a-vis whom the

r is in a position of domination of trust

(d) when the victim is a public figure generally

loved and respected by the community for the

services rendered by him and the murder 18

committed for political or similar reasons other



than personal reasons.”







283. In Pratt’s case referred in Mr Mamun it

appears the rules in force in Jamaica laid down a

strict timetable for appeals to the Judicial

Committee of the Privy Council and further provid-

ed that execution would only be stayed so long as

the timetable was adhered to, There were also cer-

tain other pleas that were raised. The Privy Council

accepted their plea and commuted their sentence to

imprisonment for life on the following reasons:



“prolonged delay in carrying out a sentence

of death after that sentence had been passed

could amount to inhuman......... punishment or

other treatment contrary to section 17(1) of the

Jamaican Constitution irrespective of whether

the delay was caused by the shortcomings of the

state or the Jegitimate resort of the accused to

all available appellate procedures. A state that

wished to retain capital punishment had to

accept the responsibility of ensuring that execu-

tion followed as swiftly as practicable after sen-

tence, allowing a reasonable time for appeal

and consideration of reprieve and, if the appel-

late procedure enabled the prisoner to prolong

the appellate hearings over a period of years,

the fault was to be attributed to the appellate

system that permitted such delay and not to the

prisoner who took advantage of it.”







284. In Henfield’s case the Privy Council, fol-



Avs ST



saves (Md Tec Islan J) 62 DER (AD) (29),

)



n which execution Was to take

any case j p

more than five years after sentence there y.,



be strong grounds for believing that the dele,

at execution thereafter would ..?

m.



was such th

an punishment contrary to sec),

n



stitute inhum



171)".



285. In Guerra’ case the Privy Councij fa

lowed the principles taken in Pratt's case observeg



as follows:



“Where a person was sentenced to death in

a common law jurisdiction, execution y,,.

required to be carried out by the state as SWifily

as practicable after sentence, allowing a reason.

able time for appeal and consideration o¢

reprieve, since under the common law a long.

delayed execution was not in accordance y ith

the due process of law. In Trinidad and Tobay,

such an execution, if not stayed, would consi.

tute a cruel and unusual punishment contrary to

section 5(2)(b) of the Constitution and would

not be in accordance with the due process of

law under section 4(a) of the Constitution.” |)

thus appears that the principles laid down in the

above decisions are not applicable in the pres-

ent case, applying the principles of due process

of law as applicable in a common law jurisdic-

tion is not applicable to our legal judicial sys-

tem since we have codified laws on the subject

and (2) there are uniform decisions of our

Superior Court that mere delay is not a legal

ground for commutation of a sentence.



286. As it appears the principles laid down in

the above decisions are not applicable in the present

applying as the principles of due process of law as

applicable in a common law jurisdiction is not appli-

cable to our legal judicial system since we have

modified laws on the subject and (2) there are uni-

form decisions of our Superior Court that mere

nid is not a legal ground for commutation of a sen-

ence.



owing Pratt’s case and the principles applied in that

se iti

» accepted the petition and commuted the sen- 287, Accordingly I find that the accused per



tence ae - eee

poral death to imprisonment for life observing as SS including the appellants in a planned mannet

committed the heinous crime with their knowledg¢



of the consequences and therefore, they do

deserve any special sympathy in awarding the se™

tence. Therefore, I find no merit in these appeals 2"



“They therefore reviewed

Or the relevant con-

siderations, at pp. 34-35, and concluded that in



            


accordingly, the appeals are dismissed with Modifi

ation as stated earlier.



Md Abdul Aziz J: 1 have pone through and |

willy agree with the judgment delivered by my

jearned brother Mr Md Tafazzul Islam, J, dealing

with the case exhaustively on merit on facts, evi-

gence. law and case laws. 1 also agree with the

opservations made by my leamed brothers, Mr Md

Muzammel Hossain, J and Mr Surendra Kumar

sinha, J.



289. Having so agreed with my learned broth-

es, 1 take this opportunity to add, from unfolded

facts and circumstances of the case and from

Counsel's submissions, untold suffering and agony

of two broken-hearted daughters of the murdered

president and the humiliation of long waiting of the

whole nation since 1975 to bring the culprits of the

evilish killing to justice.



290. Murder of innocent unarmed men and

women and children is the greatest sin in Islam and

also in all other religions and a great crime against

civilisation and mankind. In Islam, death is the only

punishment for murder. Similar punishment has also

been provided in all other religions and under crim-



inal law with exception to transportation for life in

some circumstances.



291. The learned Counsels for the appellants

took us to the facts, evidence and materials on

record of the case including the 3 (three) confes-

sional statements made by convict appellants

Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Syed Faruque Rahman,

Ltd. Colonel (Retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery)



and Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Sultan Shahriar

Rashid Khan.



292. In the instant case, the convicts in the

early morning (Fazar Prayer time) of 15th August,

1975 dastardly murdered the then President of the

Republic, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.,

Father of the Nation and founder of the Republic,

his wife Begum Fazilat-un-nessa Mujib, their 3

(three) sons, Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal and the 9-

10 years old youngest son Sheikh Russell, wives of

Sheikh Kamal and Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Naser

Rahman, the brother of the President along with



other inmates and security officers, in all 11 (eleven)

persons, at the residence of the President at Road

#32, Dhanmondi Residential Area, Dhaka.



293. Mr Anisul Huq, the Chief Prosecutor for

the respondent, termed the incident of unprovocated

killing of unarmed men, women and child as

heinous and barbarous unknown to civilisation and

rare in the history of mankind.



294. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned

Attorney-General, termed it as tragic and inhuman

(he burst into tears while placing the evidence on

murder of Sheikh Russell). Mr Ajmalul Hossain,

QC, described it as horrendous killing, Sr Advocate

Mr Tawfique Newaz, Sr Advocate Mr Abdul Matin

Khasru, former Law Minister, Sr Advocate and

President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Mr

AFM Mesbahuddin Ahmed, for the Apex Bar and on

behalf of all the Bars of the country, with tears

rolling on their cheeks, termed the incident as

pathetic, brutal and barbarous referring to and

reminding us the tragic incident of "Karbala mas-

sacre" at the hands of devil forces of Yeazid. They

all in unison with choked voice sought justice nar-

rating the events unfolding the evidence and materi-

als on record as to how brutally the convicts perpe-

trated the incident and how the criminals were pro-

tected, sheltered, rewarded and maintained under



State patronisation by the then Governments up to

1996.



295. The learned Counsels for the respon-

dents drew our attention from evidence and materi-

als on record that, the convicts from time to time

met and discussed about their conspiracy with Kh.

Mustaque Ahmed, the then Minister, Major General

Ziaur Rahman, the then Deputy Chief of Army, who

after 15th of August, 1975 became Chief of Army,

later Chief Martial Law Administrator and thereafter

usurped power as President of the Republic, his

reaction in the very morning of 15th August, 1975,

hearing about the killing of the President from

Colonel Shafayet Jamil, how a Police Officer of the

local Police Station driven out the PW 1 AFM

Mohitul Islam with filthy language refusing to

record FIR from him apprehending threat on his life

and service, which came true shortly with the pass-

ing of the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 by Khondker

Mustaque Ahmed, who became the President of the



            
 Republic after the incident, sending the culprits 

abroad on 4th November, 1975 by him/Major 

General Khaled Mosharaf and inclusion of the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 in the schedule of 5th Amendment of the constitution and rehabilitating them in different foreign missions Bangladesh by president General Ziaul Rahman and subsequently 

by the next President General HM Ershad and there after under State patronisations.



protector using the State machineries and public

exchequer to harbour the notorious criminals 

providing them shelter and jobs disgracing  our

internationally against common sentiment

nation to bring and put them on trial.



206. Senior Counsel Mr Ajmalul Hossain,

QC, strongly   voiced that role of Government visa-

vis state 2s cuardian of the people is to protect, safe

guard and uphold the right and liberty of its citizens

and law end order of the country. But after killing of

the President, General Ziaur Rahman hijacked the

constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties of

the citizens, justice delivery system totally failed

and collapsed after proclamation of the Indemnity

Ordinance, 1975 and the aggrieved persons failed to

secure justice by bringing the heinous offenders to

trial. He added that the then Governments took the

role of protector of the criminals instead of dis-

charging the responsibilities of prosecuting them

resulting in colossal and catastrophic failure of dis-

pensation of justice and law and order.



such a gruesome mass kil



297. Mr Hossain contended that the

Constitution was eclipsed by the acts of the parties,

although Martial Law is no law but a jungle law, our

Supreme Court termed the Martial Law as ‘Supra

Constitutional.’ Hon'ble Chief Justice, a Civilian,

was made Chief Martial Law Administrator, who

later obliged to administer oath to the hi jacker, who

grabbed State power as the President of the

Republic,



298. Mr Anisul Hug, the leamed Counsel for

the respondent, pointed out in a deep voice that

Prosecution, with a view to get justice and to see

tule of Jaw has been established, unsuccessfully

moved from Court to Court in High Court Division

with heavy pain and agony, with humiliation and

filed m reeling embarrassed for reasons :

amen is them. He concluded that, having taken

a dispense justice without fear and favou,

such attitude of the learned — shown in thi,

case must not repeat in any case c ‘i a EXCEpt op

the grounds as provided in their Code of Con duct

The learned Counsels of the appellants took thi,

opportunity and pleaded for commutation of death

sentence of the convicts to transportation for life on

the ground of prolonging of the appellants in con.

demned cell for delay in hearing of the appeals due



to embarrassment of the learned Judges.



299. Learned Attorney-General drew ou;

attention to the intensity of the brutality from the

evidence and submitted that when weeping Russel]

wanted to go back to the lap of his mother, woung.

ed Sheikh Naser taking shelter in a bathroom, was

crying for water, Begum Fazilat-un-nessa Mujib

seeing her husband Bangabandhu lying dead in a

pool of blood on the stairs cried out and asked to kil]

her, "3/1521" (devils) silenced all of them with

shower of bullets exceeding the cruelty perpetrated

by demon force of devil Yeazid in 'Karbala’.



300. Mr Attorney-General added that the then

Government not only harboured those criminals but

also allowed Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Syed

Faruque Rahman to float a political party in the

country named "Freedom Party" and a National

Daily named "The Millat" and also allowed to con-

test as a Presidential candidate in the general elec-

tion, Major (Retd) Bazlul Huda and Lieutenant

Colonel (Retd) Kh. Abdur Rashid were allowed to

contest in the general election in 1996 and were

elected as Members of the Parliament and kh

Rashid was made leader of the opposition earning

hatred and discord of the people. He submitted that

this was not a murder of an individual but they want

ed to kill the ideals, values and the achievement of

our war of liberation.



301. Mr Attorney-General continued that the

heinous criminals neither deserve any mercy no!

any sympathy to get shelter in any country having

minimum respect for law and justice not to speak ©

any Muslim country being great enemies of Isla

and mankind.



            
302. Mr Attorney-General strongly urged upon

us to ensure that no learned Chief Justice should bow

and yield to force and pressure and take the post of

Chief Martial Law Administrator or administer oath

any usurper in future, disgracing the Judiciary, We

have heard the leaned Counsel for the respondents.

rei submissions merit consideration.



303. The devilish incident of killing occurred

ihe early morning (Fazar Prayer Time) of 15th

in gust 1975 in the Official House of the then

dent Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at

road No. 32, Dhanmondi Residential Area, Dhaka



under the then Lalbagh Police Station, now



Dhanmondi. The convicts brutally killed 11 (eleven)



arson there including the then President as stated

above. The two daughters of the President, Sheikh



Hasina, NOW Prime Minister of Bangladesh, and her

sister Sheikh Rehana luckily escaped death as they

were abroad at that time, but unfortunately, became

orphans overnight.



304. Evidence and materials on record show

that the. convicts brutally killed the unarmed

President, his wife, brother and three sons with their

wives Without any provocation or resistance for

their personal gain and interest. Mr Mohitul Islam,

pW 1, the then resident PA to the President sustained

bullet injuries in his body and was admitted into

Dhaka Medical College Hospital. He escaped from

the Hospital and went to Lalbagh Police Station to

lodge FIR (First Information Report) over the inci-

dent. But he was driven out by the Police Officer

instead of recording the information of murder.



305. On 15th August, 1975 Khondker

Mustaque Ahmed a Minister of Sheikh Mujib

Government, became the President after the killings.

He promulgated Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 on 26-

9-1975, Scenario of the country rapidly changed

thereafter, Martial Law was declared, the convicts

were sent abroad, Khandker Mustaque Ahmed was

temoved, General Ziaur Rahman became Chief of

Amy and later Chief Martial Law Administrator

and became the President of Bangladesh and later

General HM Ershad stepped in as President till he

Was removed in 1990 by people's uprising. By

Proclamation Order No.1 of 1977 dated 23-4-1977

and inclusion of Indemnity Ordinance in the

Schedule of subsequent Sth Amendment of the

Constitution by President General Ziaur Rahman

the miscreants, including the convicts, were indem-

nified from trial of the liability of all murders, acts

and misdeeds committed by them, the convicts and



others were given jobs in different Foreign Mission

of Bangladesh, etc.



306. PW 1, Mr Mohitul Islam lodged the

instant FIR starting Dhanmondi PS Case No.10

(10)1996 dated 2-10-1996 after 21 years when the

Government led by Awami League came to power

through General Election held in late 1996. The

Government brought a bill in the Parliament and

repealed the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 dated 26-9-

1975 by Indemnity Ordinance Repealing Act (Act

No.21) of 1996 dated 14-11-1996. Convicts

Lieutenant Colonel(Retd) Syed Faruque Rahman

(through his mother Mahmuda Rahman) and

Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid

Khan in Writ Petition No.5313 of 1996 and Wnt

Petition No.5321 of 1996 respectively challenged

the Repealing Act and the Dhanmondi PS Case and

also Lalbagh PS Case being Lalbagh PS Case No.11

(11) 1975 dated 4-11-1975 unsuccessfully before

the High Court Division and before the Appellate

Division in Civil Appeal No.18 of 1997 and Civil

Appeal No.19 of 1997 respectively, and this

Division affirmed the judgment and order passed by

the High Court Division in the Writ Petitions scrap-

ping the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 and upholding

the Indemnity Repeal Act being Act No.21 of 1996

[Ref: 49 DLR 133 and 1998 BLD (AD) 155].

Thereafter, the instant proceeding started and trial of

20 charge-sheeted accused including the convicts

was held and they (15) were convicted under sec-

tions 302/34 read with section 120B of the Penal

Code and were sentenced under sections 302/34 o

the Code to death by the learned Sessions Judge

Dhaka in presence of Lieutenant Colonel (Retd

Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret

Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant

Colonel (Retd, Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) and 

absentia against the rest, vide his judgment at

order dated 8-11-1998 passed in Sessions Ca

No.319 of 1997 and made the Death Reference

No.30 of 1998 to the High Court Division for cc

firmation. The aforesaid 3 (three) convicts fact’

trial filed Criminal Appeals before the High Court

Division in 1998.



            
 307. The above is, in a nutshell, the startling

picture of colossal erosion of human values, morals,

rights and liberties, Jaw and order and of justice

delivery system due to passing of the Indemnity

Ordinance, 1975, obstructing and depriving the een

stitutionally guaranteed right of the citizens to io

justice through due process of law, This is not on y

unheard of and unexpected to any civilised ae

but also inconceivable and unthinkable that ae

Government being bounded by and implementer a

the Constitution, being guardian of it's citizens

rights and liberties, law and order of the country,

instead of providing and helping its citizens getting

justice, protected, rehabilitated and harboured the

criminals by misusing the State machinery and the

hard toiled money of the citizens illegally and with-

out authority only to fulfill their personal interest

and imperial high ambition.



308. Creating obstruction to get justice cre-

ates agitation among people ultimately creating law

and order situation. Delay in dispensing justice due

to embarrassment of learned Judges is also shameful

and at the same time disgraceful for the judiciary as

2 whole frustrating ends of justice and causing dis-

respect to the faith reposed by the people to the judi-

ciary, creating vicious atmosphere and impression to

shake and lose their confidence in judiciary leading

to devastating repercussion among them detrimental

to establish rule of law.



309. We are shockingly in dearth of proper

words to deprecate, condemn, disapprove and

denounce such treacherous, immoral and unautho-

rised activities of the beneficiary governments and

their misuse of Government machineries, No

bereaved family should be deprived of their right to

get justice nor should they move with pain, agony

and humiliation seeking justice for decades against

Government obstruction under the blanket of black

law nor any learned Judge should feel embarrass-

ment beyond their code of conduct to dispense jus-

tice being faithful to our oath, out of fear and favour.

Such activities of the Government are highly irre-

sponsible, regrettable, disgraceful and shameful not

only to the nation but also to the civilized commu-

nity of the world and lowered down the image of the

country internationally, We like to hope resolutely

and believe that neither the learned Judges 7

indulge to repeat their tarnishing role nop , i

heinous and nefarious acts at the Government

using Government power, authority and Jeg.)







310. Mr Attorney-General concluded that

people have Constitutional right to know as to her

and under what authority the convicts after Commi.

ting such devilish offences were protecteg sn

patronised by the beneficiary Governments at the

cost of the reputation and public exchequer of th.

country since 15th August, 1975. °



311. In the periphery of the instant Case, it j

indeed, difficult for us to address the submission, of

the learned Attorney-General, but we agree that; the

citizens of the Republic have the right to know ho»,

their hard earned money was being spent by the

Government and what was the authority of the

Government to protect, shelter and rehabilitate the

criminals instead of bringing them to face trial.



312. The arms of law is yet much more longer

and mighty than the devilish might and misdeeds of

the despotic and treacherous Government. |t is

revealed from the instant case that justice delayed is

not always (justice) denied but is available to the

endurance. We have high respect in the people of

this country who always held high against all odds,

the spirit of democracy and pursued through pain

and hardship to restore and retain democratic rights

and culture through democratic Government. We

believe that the people shall continue their role as

vanguard of democracy to make the Government

accountable,



313. God, the Almighty, likes and loves the

tolerant and crowns with success, A murderer is

always a murderer and a terrorist is always a terror

1st and is enemy to mankind and humanity and an

offender in the eye of law. To protect and shelter

such killers is a great crime, a great sin and sit

Spares none.



BK Das J: I agree with the judgment a

order delivered by my learned brother Md Tafazzul

Islam, J.



            
Md Muzammel Hossain J: 1 have gone

through the draft judgment and order delivered by

ny learned brother Md Tafazzul Islam, } in Criminal

appeal Nos.55-59 of 2007 preferred by the accused:

appellants against the judgment and order of con-

vition and sentence dated 30-4-2001 passed by the

Hon'ble High Court Division in Death Reference

No. 30 of 1998 along with Criminal Appeal

Nos.2604% 2613, 2616 and 2617 of 1998 and

criminal Appeal No.434 of 2007 confirming the

death sentences awarded against the accused appel-

lants BY the leamed Sessions Judge on 8-11-1998 in

gessions Case No. 319 of 1997 under sections 302,

34 and 120B of the Penal Code, 1860. In this

spamentous judgment concurring with the decision

nounced by my leared brother Md Tafazzul

jslam, J, I want to share my thoughts and views as

this case involves some vital questions of law hav-

ing far reaching consequences.



316. We have already passed a short order dis-

missing the appeal which forms part of the judg-

ment.



317. Since my learned brother has stated the

facts of this case in detail in his judgment and order,

I would not repeat the same. The above appeals have 

arisen out of the gruesome and brutal murder of the

President and Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and members of his fami-

ly in the early hours of 15th August, 1975 at the offi-

cial residence of the then President at House

No.677, Road No.32, Dhanmondi, Dhaka. The

informant, PW 1, who was present at the residence

of the then President at the time of the incident

lodged a First Information Report (FIR) on 2-10-

1996. The Investigating Officer (IO), after thorough

investigation, submitted a charge sheet against 20

(twenty) accused persons including the present

appellants under sections 302/120B/324/307/201/

380/149/34/109 of the Penal Code. The learned

Sessions Judge, Dhaka by his Order No.15 dated 7-

4-1997 framed charges against 20 (twenty) accused

Persons under sections 120B, 302, 34 and 201 of the

Penal Code. Accused Jubaida Rashid was dis-

charged by the High Court Division in a Criminal

Revision Case. Accordingly, 19 (nineteen) accused

Persons including the appellants faced the trial,

Sixty-one witnesses were examined in total. No evi-

dence was adduced by the defence. Thereafter, the

trial Court vide his judgment and order dated 8-11-

1998 convicted 15 (fifteen) persons including the

accused-appellants under sections 302/34/120B of

the Penal Code and acquitted 4 (four) of the accused

persons, The said 15 (fifteen) accused persons

including the accused-appellants were sentenced to

death under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.

Notwithstanding the fact that the accused-appel-

lants, along with eleven others, were also convicted

under section 120B of the Penal Code, the learned

Sessions Judge, Dhaka did not impose any separate

sentence thereunder.



318. As against the aforesaid judgment and

order of conviction and sentence dated 8-11-1998

passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Dhaka, the

convict-appellants, namely, Lieutenant Colonel

Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan preferred Criminal

Appeal No.2604 of 1998; Major Md Bazlul Huda

preferred Criminal Appeal No.2613 of 1998;

Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman preferred

Criminal Appeal No.2616 of 1998; Lieutenant

Colonel (Retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) pre-

ferred Criminal Appeal No.2617 of 1998; and Major

(Retd) AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) preferred

Criminal Appeal No.434 of 2007 before the Hon'ble

High Court Division.



319. Thereafter, the Hon’ble High Court

Division comprising Md Ruhul Amin, J and ABM

Khairul Haque, J conducted analogous hearing of

the Death Reference No.30 of 1998 and the afore-

said five Criminal Appeals. However, the Division

Bench rendered split opinions in respect of the judg-

ment and order of conviction and sentence awarded

against 15 (fifteen) accuseds including the present

accused-appellants. The first learned Judge of the

High Court Division, Md Ruhul Amin, J accepted

the death reference in part in respect of four convict-

appellants, namely, Lieutenant Colonel Syed

Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Sultan

Shahriar Rashid Khan, Major Md Bazlul Huda and

Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) and five

other convicts, namely, Lieutenant Colonel Abdur

Rashid, Lieutenant Colonel Shariful Hoque Dalim,

nd 1208 ofthe Penal Code to conviction and sen-

ence under section 120B of the Penal Code and

reby maintained the death sentence as he was a

arty to the criminal conspiracy. But his conviction

and sentence under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal

Code was set aside. The first leamed Judge rejected

the death reference in respect of appellant

Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed

(Arullery) and allowed his appeal being Criminal

Appeal No2617 of 1998 and the judgment and

order of conviction and sentence passed by the

eamed Sessions Judge in respect of him was set

aside and, accordingly, first learned Judge of the

High Court Division set aside the judgment and

order of the learned Sessions Judge in respect of

those five convicts.



320. ABM Khairul Haque, J the second

learned Judge of Division Bench, accepted the death

reference of all 15 (fifteen) accuseds including the

accused-appellants and affirmed the judgment and

order of conviction and sentence in respect of all the

15 (fifieen) accused persons and dismissed the

aforesaid criminal appeals.



321. In view of the aforesaid split opinions

passed by a Division Bench of the High Court

Division, the cases with their opinions were referred

to the Third learned Judge of the High Court

Division, Mohammad Fazlul Karim, J under sec-

tions 378 and 429 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (CrPC). The Third learned Judge had

taken up the hearing of the Death Retorency

respect of the aforesaid six accused persons in 1)

matter of whom the learned Judges of the Divisinn

Hone had differed in their opinions Le. those ¢ (sj ;

accused persons who were found guilty by the ee

ond learned Judge but not found guilty by the fir

were also set aside acquitting them from the charge



levelled against them.



322. The convict appellants being aggrieved

with the judgment and order dated 30-4-2001 passed

by the High Court Division accepting the death ref:

erence and dismissing their respective appeals pre-

ferred separate criminal petitions for leave to appeal

against the judgment and order of the Third learned

Judge of the High Court Division. The Appellate

Division upon analogous hearing of the appeals

passed a common leave granting order on five

grounds, which have been reproduced by my

learned brother Md Tafazzul Islam, J in his judg-

ment.



323. As regards the first ground as to the

scope and jurisdiction of Third learned Judge, Mr

Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned Advocate for the

appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos.56 and 58 of

2007, has submitted that the first learned Judge of

the Division Bench of the High Court Division dis-

carded all the three confessional statements one 0!

which was made by Lieutenant Colonel (Ret¢)

Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) whose confession

was finally decided by the Third learned Judge to be

true and voluntary. But the remaining two confe-

sions were kept undecided for his exclusion from



            
the hearing and as such, finality of opinion to follow

the jugement as pet provision of section 429 read

with section 377 of CrPC for the purpose of section

We ‘ not been achieved. In support of his con.

Yi he has referred to the case of Hethubha ys

ee of Gujarat reported in 1970 (1) SCC (Cr) 280,

y ian of India vs Anantha Padma Nabiah reported

Un on] SCC (Cri), Sajjan Singh vs State of MP

ep ated in 1999 SCC (Cri) 44 and Mohim Mondal

marae reported in 15 DLR 615.



324. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Advocate

sgring for the respondent-State, has referred to

ihe provisions of sections 377, 378 and 429 of the

pc and has submitted that the decided cases of

pangladesh, Pakistan and India demonstrate that the

Third learned Judge has been endowed with wide

giscretion to decide how to deal with the case and

that it is completely the Third learned Judge’s dis-

cretion as to how he will hear the case, (and in the

manner) as he thinks fit. He then submits that where

there are more than one accused in the case and the

jeamed Judges of the Division Bench are equally

divided on their opinion then the case of the accused

as to whom the Judges are equally divided on their

point shall be laid before the Third leamed Judge

and, on the other hand, when the learned Judges are

equally divided with regard to all the accuseds then

the whole case with regard to the accuseds is

referred to the Third learned Judge. In this context

Mr Hug has argued that the cases of the Sub-

Continent are divided into two groups, firstly, where

there are difference of opinion in respect of all the

accuseds and the cases where there are difference of

opinion either on evidence or on points of law relat-

ing to conviction or acquittal regarding some of the

accuseds. In this context Mr Huq has referred to the

decisions of the cases of Dharam Singh vs State of

UP reported in 1964 (1) CrLJ 78, Babu vs State of

UP reported in AIR 1965 SC 1467, Hethubha vs

Khair reported in 44 DLR 284.



325. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned

Attorney-General, has also made identical submis-

sion like Mr Anisul Huq in respect of the scope and

jurisdiction of the Third learned Judge. He has sub-

mitted that when the Judges of a Division Bench are

equally divided in opinion and not concurrent the

provisions of sections 378 and 429 of the CrPC are

applicable, and accordingly, he referring to the pro-

visions of section 378 of the CrPC has submitted

that when the Judges of the Division Bench are

divided in their opinion, the case with their opinions

thereon shall be laid before another Judge of the

same Court and such Judge after such hearing as he

thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and the judgment

and order shall follow such opinion and thereby the

opinion of the Third learned Judge shall reach to its

finality becoming the judgment of the Court.



326. He has argued that in case of split judg-

ment, the question of signing of the judgment by at

least two Judges as provided in section 377 is not

applicable in view of the decision of the case of

Babu vs State of UP reported in AIR 1963 SC 1467.

As regards power and jurisdiction of the Third

learned Judge the learned Attorney-General has

referred to the decision of the case of Sarat Chandra

Mitra vs Emperor reported in 15 CWN 18 = ILR 38

Cal 202, Ibrahim vs State reported in PLD 1959

(WP) Lahore 715, the case of Mahim Mondal vs

Modhya Pradesh reported in AIR 1998 SC 2756 and

the unreported decision in our jurisdiction in the

case of State vs Md Foysal Alam Ansari and others

prisoners were not contemplated to be heard and

decided to hear the cases of the 6(six) condemned

prsoners over whom the Judges of the Division

Bench are equally divided.



328. Mr Ajmalul Hossain, the learned

AGvosate appearing for the respondent-State as spe-

cial prosecutor, has referred to. us Chapter XXVII of

the CrPC which contains the provisions in respect of

the submissions of sentence for confirmation and

also Chapter XXXI under Part 7 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure which contains provisions of

eppeals arising out of the judgment and order of

cnminal Court. He has submitted that from the

scheme of the law Chapter XXVII of the Code con-

lains detailed provisions for submissions of the pro-

ceedings to the High Court Division when the Court

of Sessions passes the death sentence and the sen-

tence of death shall not be executed unless it is con-



firmed by the High Court Division, Referring to the

Scheme of the



mitted that by laying down the eave with thoi a

that the Third Judge is completely free jp resolv

Hossain has strived hard to argue that g¢

it is for the Third Judge to decide on what Points p,,

asserted that there is no illegality in the Pinion py

ed unless it is confirmed by the High Cour

Division. So it is mandatorily required to submit the

proceedings before the High Court Division for con.

firmation of death sentence, Section 377 of the Code

contemplates that the confirmation of sentence shall

be made and signed by at least two Judges of the

High Court Division. But when the Judges of the

High Court Division are equally divided in their

opinion, according to provision of section 378 of the

Code, “the case with their opinions thereon shall be

another Judge and such Judge after

is a well established principles of law that once a

criminal appeal is admitted it must be decided on

verits and cannot be dismissed for non prosecution

yen if the appellant or his Advocate remains absent

in the Court at the time of hearing of the appeal, the

p ellate Court cannot avoid its responsibility or

uty from perusing the record of the case and giving

reasons in deciding the matter on merit. When the

rudges of the Divition Bench as the Court of appeal

e equally divided in opinion, ‘the case with their

opinions thereon shall be laid before another Judge”

of the same Court and such Judge after such hearing

‘any as he thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and

the judgment and order shall follow such opinion.

From 2 careful reading of the provision of section

378 vis-a-vis section 429 of the Code it appears that

though the provisions in both these sections are

identical in nature, when the Judges of a Division

Bench are equally divided in their opinion yet sec-

tion 429 envisages that “the case, with their opinions

thereon shall be laid before another Judge of the

same Court and such Judge after such hearing (if

any) as he thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and the

judgment and order shall follow such opinion”.



329. From the above expressions we find that

the words “of the same Court” after the words

“nother Judge” and the. expression “if any” after

the expression “such hearing” do not exist in section

378. By adding these two expressions in section 429

of the Code the legislature intended to say that when

the Judges of the Division Bench are equally divid-

ed in opinion while disposing appeal, the case with

their opinions thereon shall be laid before another



Judge of the same Court. Thereby meaning a Judge.



of the appellate Court who is “completely free” to.

decide on what points he shall hear arguments if any

and that Third learned Judge is free to decide the

appeal by resolving the differences in the manner he

thinks proper.



330. During the course of hearing the learned

Advocates from both sides have made elaborate

submissions on the scope and jurisdiction of the

Third learned Judge. It has come to our notice that

Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned Advocate in

Criminal Appeal Nos.56 of 2007 and

Whose arguments have been adopted by the learned

Advocate for the other appellants, has referred to the

case reported in 1999 SCC (CRI) 44, ILR 38 Cal

202, 1970 (1) SCC (Cr) 280, 1971 SCC (Cri) 535,

15 DLR 615 and he has also submitted that the

expression “as he thinks fit” does not qualify the

word “hearing” and there is no co-relation between

“hearing” and “as he thinks fit” and accordingly he

has submitted that for breach of the provisions of

section 377 of the Code for not signing the judgment

by two Judges, there is no judgment in the eye of

law. As such the judgment and order of conviction

and sentence is not tenable in law. From our careful

scrutiny we have found that the same cases are also

relied on by the respondents in support of their con-

tentions. It would be profitable for us to examine the

relevant decisions in this context. In the case of

Dharam Singh vs State of UP reported in 1964 (1)

CrLJ 78, there was difference regarding all the

accuseds. In this case trial Judge convicted ten

accused persons under sections 302 and 149 of the

Indian Penal Code and acquitted two accused per-

sons. The State appealed against acquittal and ten

accused persons preferred appeal against convic-

tion. A Division Bench of the High Court differed in

their opinions and the matter was laid before the

Third learned Judge who concurring with one of the

Judges upheld the conviction of ten appellants and

set aside the acquittal of one accused, where the

judgment and order of the Court has followed the

opinion of Third learned Judge.



331. In the case of Babu vs State of the UP

reported in AJR 1965 SC 1467, the appeal was

against conviction and sentence’ of four accused

appellants under sections 304 and 34 of the Indian

Penal Code. First learned Judge dismissed the

appeal disbelieving some part of the evidence and -

the second learned Judge allowed the appeal. The

Supreme Court of India held that section 429 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure contemplates that it is

for the Third Judge to decide on what points he shall

hear arguments if any and that postulates that he was |completely free in resolving difference as he thinks 

fit. In the case of Hethubha vs State of Gujarat

reported in AIR 1970 SC 1266 the trial Court acquit-

ted all the three accused persons under sections 302

read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code but

convicted all the accused persons ‘for the offences



            
punishable under sections 304 Part-2 read with sec-

tion 34 and sentenced them to suffer rigorous

imprisonment for five years. Accused No.1-

Hethubha and No.2-Ranubha were convicted for the

offences punishable under section 323 and accused

No.3-Malubha was convicted for the offence pun-

ishable under section 323 read with section 34 of the

Indian Penal Code. The accused Nos.1 and 2 were

sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three

months while accused No.2 was sentenced for two

months and all the sentences were to run concur-

rently, All the accused preferred appeals against

their convictions before the Division Bench in the

Hich Court of Gujarat. Divan, J held that accused

No.1 was guilty for the offence under section 302

and accused Nos.2 and 3 were found guilty under

section 324 read with section 34. Shelat, J acquitted

all the accused because he was not satisfied with the

evidence of proof of the identity of the accused. The

case was placed before the Third learned Judge

Mehta, J under section 429 of the Code who found

accused No.1 guilty under section 302 and accused

Nos.2 and 3 guilty under section 302 read with sec-

tion 34 and all of them were sentenced to suffer rig-

orous imprisonment for life. The conviction of

accused Nos.] and 2 under section 323 and of the

accused No.3 under section 323 read with section 34

was upheld. The conviction of all the accuseds

under section 304 Part-2 was altered as stafed above.

On appeal, the Supreme Court of India held that the

Third Judge was competent to deal with the whole

case.



332. In the case of Union of India vs BN

Anantha Padma Nabiah reported in AIR 1971 SC

1836 there was difference of opinion regarding all

the accused persons. Reference was made to the

Third Judge. In this case Supreme Court considered

the case of Bhagat Ram vs State of Rajasthan report-

ed in (1972) 3 SCR 303 where the Third Judge held

that Bhagat Ram was guilty of the offence under

section 389 and also sections 120B, 218 and 347 of

the Indian Penal Code. It has been held that it was

not permissible for the Third Judge to re-open the

matter and convict Bhagat Ram of the offences

under section 120B and 218 of the Indian Penal

Code as the Division Bench comprising the first and

second Judge confirmed the acquittal of Bhagat

Ram in respect of charge under sections 347, 218,

389 and 120B of the Penal Code. In the case 4},

entire matter relating to acquittal of conviction ang

sentence of Bhagat Ram had not been left ope,

because of difference of opinion between the two

Judges. The Supreme Court of India in the case gf

Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in AIR 1979

SC 1266 observed that the scope of section 429

CrPC was not confirmed in Bhagat Ram’s case, No

question was raised whether the Judges of the

Division Bench restrict the power of the Third Judge

under section 429 nor the notice of the Court

appears to have been drawn to three earlier dec).

sions of the Court on the point, namely, in the case

of Babu vs State of UP reported in AIR 1966 sc

1467, Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in 4/p

1970 SC 1266 and Union of India vs BN Anantha

Padma Nabiah reported in AJR 1971 SC 1836 which

was unreported when Bhagat Ram’s case was decid-

ed. Having considered all these three cases the

Supreme Court tried in the case of Babu vs State of

UP reported in AIR 1966 SC 1467 held that section

429, CrPC contemplates that it is for the Third Judge

to decide on what points he shall hear arguments, if

any, and that postulates that he is completely free in

resolving the difference as he thinks fit. In the case

of Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in AIR

1970 SC 1266 the Supreme Court having considered

the decision reported in AJR 1965 SC 1467 held that

two things are noticeable in section 429 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure: firstly, the case shall be laid

before another Judge, and, Secondly, the judgment

and order will follow the opinion of the Third

learned Judge. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held

that the Third learned Judge can or will deal with the

whole case and that the Third learned Judge

whom the case was referred under section 429 has

not overstated the limits in deciding the case as @

whole. The appeal was dismissed accordingly.



333. In the case of State of Andhra Pradesh vs

PT Appaiah reported in AJR 1981 SC 265. two

accused persons were convicted under sections 302

and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced 

of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life. "

appeal the Division Bench Judges differed the

nature of the offence that was committed by '

accused in causing the injury. Madhava Reddy’

held punishable under section 304 Part of 

Penal Code and Sriramula, J dismissed the appeal



            
holding that the Sessions Judge rightly convicted the

accused under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian

Penal Code. But the Third Judge Ramchandra Raju,

J acquitted both the accuseds. Supreme Court held

that the Third Judge before whom the case was laid

for opinion is competent to deal with the whole case

and he is not bound to confine his judgment only to

the matter conceming difference of opinion between

the other two Judges. The Supreme Court have

relied with observations made in the case of Union

of India vs BN Anantha Padma Nabiah reported in

AIR 1971 SC 1836 which runs as follows:



“This question came up for consideration

in the recent unreported decision in Hethubha

vs State Of GujfArdt

This Court held that the Third learned Judge

could deal with the whole case. The language of

section 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

is explicit that the case with the opinion of the

Judges comprising the Court of Appeal shall be

laid before another Judge of the same Court.

The other noticeable feature in section 429 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure is that the judg-

ment or order shall follow the opinion of the

Third learned Judge.”



334. In the case of Tanviben Pankajkumar

Divetia vs State of Gujarat reported in AJR 1997

SCC 7156 the accused appellant was convicted

under section 302 read with section 34 of the Indian

Penal Code against which he preferred appeal

before the Gujarat High Court. A Division Bench of

the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by

the State against the acquittal of the appellant of the

charges levelled under section 302 read with section

120B of the Penal Code and section 302 of the

Indian Penal Code. One Judge acquitted the accused

and the other Judge convicted the accused, The mat-

ter was referred to Third Judge. The Third learned

Judge upheld the conviction of the appellant under

section 302 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, the

appeal of the appellant was dismissed by the High

Court. On appeal, the Supreme Court of India held

that:

“it is for the Third Judge to decide on. what

points he shall hear arguments, if any, and it

necessarily postulates that the Third Judge is

free to decide the appeal by resolving the dif-

ference in the manner he thinks proper.”



335. Mr Justice GN Ray observed as under:



“In, Babu vs State of Uttar Pradesh, (AIR

1965 SC 1467), it has been held by Constitution

Bench of this Court that where the Third Judge

did not consider it necessary to decide a partic-

ular point on which there had been difference of

opinion between the two Judges, but simply

indicated that if at all it was necessary for him

to come to a decision on the point, he agreed

with all that had been said about by one of the

two Judges, such decision was in conformity

with law. That the Third Judge is free to decide

the appeal in the manner he thinks fit, has been

reiterated in, Hethubha vs State of Gujarat,

(AIR 1970 SC 1266) and Union of India vs BN

Anantha Padma Nabiah, AIR 1971 SC 1836. In

State of A. PV PT Appaiah, AIR 1981 SC 365, it

has been held by this Court that even in a case

when both the Judges had held that the accused

was guilty but there was difference of opinion

as to the nature of offence committed by the

accused, it was open to the Third Judge to

decide the appeal by holding that the accused

was not guilty by considering the case on

merit.”



336. In the case of Sajjan Singh vs State of

MP reported in (1999) 1 SCC 315 at page-324 para-

10 the Supreme Court held that it is the Third Judge

whose opinion matters; against the judgment that

follows therefrom that an appeal lies to the Supreme

Court by way of special leave petition under Article

136 of the Constitution or under Article 134 of the

Constitution or under section 379 of the Code.



337. In the case of Mattar vs State of UP

(2002) 6 SCC 460 two accused persons were con-

victed under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian Penal

Code, one of the accused died during the pendency

of the appeal before the High Court. In High Court

first Judge acquitted the appellant and the second

Judge convicted him. The matter was referred to the

Third Judge who dismissed the appeal and convict-

ed the accused appellant. The Supreme Court of

India held that the Third learned Judge, under these

circumstances, was required to independently examine



            
the matter and express his opinion. It is not per-

missible to only or merely indicate the agreement

with one or the other view without giving reasons

therefor.



338. In Radha Mohan Singh vs State of UP

(2006) 2 SCC 450 five accused persons were con-

victed under sections 147, 148, 323, 324 and 302

read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and

imposed sentence of various terms of imprisonment

includingNife imprisonment under section 302 read

with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The

accused appellant preferred appeal in the Allahabad

High Court. In the Division Bench, first learned

Judge Agarwal, J allowed the appeal and set aside

the conviction and sentence imposed thereunder but

the second Judge Mishra, J dismissed the appeal and

thereby upheld the conviction and sentence passed

by the leamed Sessions Judge. The matter was

referred to the Third Judge who upheld the convic-

tion for all. On appeal, the Supreme Court held that

the Third learned Judge is under no obligation to

accept the view of one of the Judges holding in

favour of acquittal of the accused either as a rule of

prudence or on the scope of judicial etiquette. It is

not possible to accept the contention raised by the

appellant.



339. In the case of Sarat Chandra Mitra vs

Emperor reported in ILR 38 Cal 2002 the learned

Judges of the Division Bench are equally divided in

respect of one of the accused, Sarat Chandra Mitra

and the matter was laid before the Third Judge. The

Supreme Court of India held that in the case of two

prisoners, regarding the guilt of one of whom only

the Judges of the Appellate Court are divided in

opinion, it may be that what has to be laid before

another Judge is the case of such prisoner alone, But

where they are equally divided as the guilt of one

accused, though in certain aspects they may be

agreed, the whole case as regards the accused is laid

before the Third Judge, and not merely the point or

points on which there is difference of Opinion, and it

is his duty to consider all the points involved before

. delivering his opinion upon the case,



340. In the case of Nemai Mondal ys State of

West Bengal reported in AJR 1966. Calcuting 194

there were ten appellants. Both the learned Judges of

the Division Bench were unanimous that the con-

viction of the appellant Nos.1, 9 and 19 sh

set aside. Therefore appellant Nos.1, 9 and |

been set at liberty and there is no difference of has

ion about them. The difference of opinio Din,

comes up for decision is with respect to appt at

Nos.2-8 were dealt by the Third Judge. Mukhags.

held that the case with the differing Opinion she

be placed before the Third Judge. 



341. In the case of State of UP vs Dan Sing

reported in (1997) 3 SCC 747 32 accused persons

were charged under sections 147, 302/ 149, 43 6iige

307/149 of the Indian Penal Code and under se

tions 4(iv), (x) and section 5.7 of the Protection, *

the Civil Rights Act, 1955. The Sessions Jud

acquitted all the 32 accused persons including Dan

Singh and others. State preferred appeal before the

High Court, Allahabad. Katju, J convicted two

accused, namely, Jit Singh and Kishan Sing unde,

sections 325 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code ang

sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for

five years and acquitted 30 accused Persons. By a

separate opinion Rajeshwar Singh, J convicteg six

accused men and four ladies and acquitted 2)

accused persons. The first order was of the Division

Bench regarding the acquittal of 22 accused persons.

Thereafter the case was laid before the Third learned

Judge. The Third learned Judge Mathur, J after hear-

ing the appeal of ten accused to which the two

learned Judges differed, agreed with Katju, J con.

victing two accused, namely, Jit Singh and Kishan

Sing and acquitted 30 accused persons. One special

leave petition was filed by the State against all the

32 accused persons. Leave was not granted in the

case of 4 ladies and accordingly their acquittal has

become finality and leave was granted against 28

accused persons. Supreme Court of India observed

as under:



“According to this section if there is a dif-

ference of opinion amongst the Judges of the

Bench, then their Opinions are laid before



another Judge. It is only after the Third Judge

gives his opinion that the judgment or order fol-

lows. It is clear from this that the judgment of

order which can be appealed against, undet

Article 136 of the Constitution, is only th!

Which follows after the opinion of the Lat

Judge has been delivered. What BN Katju an



            
 Rajeshwar Singh, JJ. wrote was not their judg-

ments but they were their opinions, Due to dis-

agreement amongst them, section 392 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure required the appeal

as a Whole to be laid before the Third Judge (vs

Pp Mathur, J in this case) whose opinion was to

prevail. The first order of 15-4-1987 was clear-

ly not contemplated by section 392 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure and is, therefore, non est.



342. When the appeal as a whole is heard by

the Third Judge, he not only has an option of deliy-

ering his opinion but, under the proviso to section

302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he may

require the appeal to be re-heard and decided by a

larger Bench of Judges. This was an option which,

under the proviso, was also open for any one of the

two Judges, namely, BN Katju and Rajeshwar

Singh, JJ to exercise, but they chose not to do so,

What is clearly evident is that the appeal is finally

disposed of by the judgment and order which fol-

lows the opinions of the Third Judge. This being so

special leave petition could only have been filed

afier the appeal was disposed of by the High Court

yield its final order dated 19-5-1988. Even though

the said order purports to relate only to ten out of

thirty-two accused the said order has to be read

along with the earlier order of 15-4-1987 and, in

law, the effect would be that the order dated 19-5-

1988 will be regarded as the final order whereby the

appeal of the State was partly allowed, with only

two of the thirty-two accused being convicted under

section 325 read with 34 IPC, while all the other

accused were acquitted.”



343. In the case of Granade Venkata vs

Corporation of Calcutta reported in 22 CWN 745

the accused was prosecuted and convicted under

section 495A(1) of the Calcutta Municipal Act for

selling adulterated ghee. The Magistrate allowed the

defence to rely on this evidence which was obtained

by cross-examination of the Assistant Analyst to the

Corporation who applied certain processes of analy-

sis to the sample of ghee in question and obtained

certain results from which he made the deduction

that the ghee had been adulterated with certain per-

Centages of foreign fat. No other witness has been

¢xamined on either side and the defence contended

that according to the standard works on the subject

no such deduction could be made. Defence cross-

examined the analyst. The Magistrate allowed the

defence to rely on this evidence, dealt with it as

being the evidence in the judgment. The Rule,

against the conviction was heard before two Judges,

both of whom agreed that the conviction could not

stand. Chitty, J was for a retrial on the ground that

there was no satisfactory investigation and Smither,

J held otherwise. The matter was laid before the

Third Judge Woodroffe, J who held that in a case

referred under. section 420, CrPC, a Third Judge

would not differ upon a point on which both the

referring Judges were agreed unless there were

Strong grounds for doing so. In the case of

Muhammed Shafi vs Crown reported in 6 DLR (WP)

/04 the full Bench of the High Court held that nei-

ther section 378 nor section 429 prevents the obtain-

ing of the decision of the full Bench upon a question

of law or subsequent delivery of the opinion of the

Third Judge upon the whole case. The Third Judge

before whom the case is laid under section 429 of

the Criminal Procedure Code exercise the authority

of a Bench of Judges and therefore, he should be

considered not as a single Judge, but as a Bench.

The case is not one which is dealt with in fact by a

single Judge, but one which is dealt with by three

Judges, even though the Third Judge is dealing with

it at a later stage then the two disagreeing Judges.



344. Mahim Mondal vs State reported in 15

DLR 615. In this case the appellant, Mahim Mondal,

along with other accused persons were tried under

sections 304 and 148 and various other sections. of

the Penal Code. Mahim Mondal was convicted

under sections 304 and. 148 of the Penal Code and

sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five

years and one year respectively. Accused Asab

Mondal was convicted under section 323 of the

Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigorous impris-

onment for six months, Appellant Mohim Mondal

preferred an appeal against the conviction and sen-

tence passed against him. Upon admission of the

appeal, a Division Bench issued a suo motu Rule

asking to show cause as to why the conviction and

sentence passed against the accused under the said

Code should not be set aside. The revision case aris-

es out of the Rule which was issued by the same

Court. After hearing the appeal and the revision case

a Division Bench differed in their opinion as to



            
whether the accused Mahim Mondal could have

been convicted of rioting. Consequently, the matter

was laid before the Third Judge, Morshed, J under

section 429 of the CrPC In his judgment Morshed, J

held that the whole case is required to be laid before

the Third Judge and it is his duty to consider all the

points involved before he delivers his opinion upon

the case. State vs Abul Khair reported in 44 DLR

284. In this case two Judges of the Division Bench

differed on the validity of conviction and sentence

of two appellants but agreed in respect of conviction

of one accused, namely, Abul Khair. The case was

laid before the Third Judge. The Third learned Judge

only dealt with the case of the two accused, namely,

Mosharraf and Moinuddin i.e. with regards to whom

the Judges had differed.



345. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned

Asvocate appearing for the appellants in Criminal

Appeal Nos.56 and 58 of 2007, submits that on a

clear analysis of the evidence and materials on

record it appears that the instant case is a case of

mutiny leading to murder of the President,

Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and mem-

bers of his family and relations and not a case of

murder simpliciter and, as such, the conviction of

the accused appellants by a normal criminal Court

instead of Court Martial has vitiated the trial. Mr

Khan has argued that series of events, activities,

briefings, exercises and happenings, having had

happened in Dhaka Cantonment in the night preced-

ing the fateful event occurring in the House No. 677,

Road No. 32, Dhanmondi, clearly constituted

mutiny and it does not indicate any case of murder

simpliciter. The place of occurrence includes the

cantonment and the cantonment activities, briefings

and exercises include the fact of the case and as

such, no case of agreement or pre-arranged plan,

pre-concert, common intention, criminal conspiracy

or object for common intention within the scope of

section 34 or section 120A of the Penal Code can be



lawfully inferred. Mr Khan then submits that killing

of persons in the course of mutiny is triable by a

Court Martial and in this context he has referred to

section 59 of the Army Act, 1952 and submits that

since the accused persons were in active service at

the time of the commission of offence, they should

have been in all fairness tried before a Court Martial

instead of criminal Court: In this context he has

referred to the case of Jamil Huq vs Bangla)

reported in 34 DLR 161 (AD) 125 and sub its be

for the mutiny which took place in the 

29th/30th May, 1981 resulting in death of 7; of

Rahman, President of Bangladesh trial Was ete

exclusively by a Court Martial as per Provision

section 31 of the Army Act and, as such, the tire

of the President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on the

fateful night of the 15th August by the Army per-

sonnel who were in active service should have been

tried by a Court Martial instead of a criminal Court

and, as such, the conviction and sentence Of the

accused appellant is not tenable in law. Mr Khan hag

argued that the severity of penalty in case Of mutiny

and in case of murder not being the same and the

difference is to the advantage of the appellants in a

trial by Court Martial since in the case of Punish.

ment for murder there is only one alternative of

death penalty to imprisonment for life. He has

argued that under section 31 of the Army Act any

sentence alternative to death sentence carries much

lesser punishment as mentioned in the Army Act,

1952. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman has submitted that

the plea of concurrent jurisdiction by the respondent

for the trial of the case by criminal Court or the

Court Martial basing on the provisions of sections

91 and 92 of the Army Act, 1952 had lost its force in

view of the proviso to section 92(2) of the Army Act

and that the question of concurrent jurisdiction of

trial of the case is misconceived.



346. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Advocate

appearing for the respondent has submitted that the

present case not being a case of mutiny rather a case

of murder simpliciter, no illegality was committed

by trying the accused appellants in the Criminal

Court because, even if for the sake of argument,

though not conceding, along with mutiny there was

also murder, Mr Huq has submitted that in case o!

civil offence like murder there was a concurrent

jurisdiction both in the Court Martial and Criminal

Court as per provisions of sections 94 and 95 of the

Army Act and the formalities required thereunder

along with section 549 of the CrPC have been fully

complied with and, as such, no illegality is commit

ted by holding the trial of the case in a crim

Court. Mr Anisul Huq has submitted that the a

ment in the leave granting order No.3 to the 

that ‘“‘whether there is mutiny leading to murder or



            
murder simpliciter” is misconceived because for

murder like the present case there is concurrent

jurisdiction under section 59(2) of the Army Act,

952. He then has submitted that in the instant case

ore being concurrent jurisdiction the Sessions

court having fully complied with the provisions of

eections 94 and 95 of the Army Act and section 549

of the CrPC as evidenced by the Sessions Court's

rdet dated 24-3-1997 and 3-4-1997 held the trial

and, such, no illegality is committed in holding

the trial. In this context he has referred to the deci-

<jons in the cases of MSK Ibrat vs Commander-in-

chief Royal Pakistan Navy reported in 4 DLR (SC)

128, Balbir Singh vs Punjab reported in 1995 1 SCC 90.



347. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned

Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respon-

dent, has submitted that in the instant case the

offence of murder has been tried and no charge of

mutiny has been brought against the accused appel-

Jants. The learned Judges of the Division Bench as

well as the Third learned Judge upon consideration

of evidence and materials on record have not found

any case of mutiny rather they found the case of

murder and accordingly, they have awarded their

verdict. He has argued that raising the issue of

mutiny by the defence to challenge the jurisdiction

of the trial Court at the appellate stage for the first

time is not tenable in law. He has referred to the case

of Haider Ali Khan vs State reported in 1994 BLD

(AD) 270 = 47 DLR (AD) 47 and the case of

Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto vs State reported in PLD 1979

SC 53. Mr Attorney-General having referred to the

Writ Petition No.2032 of 1997 filed on behalf of the

appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque

Rahman, challenging the sitting of the Court to

Nazim Uddin Road which has gone upto the

Appellate Division having been reported in 49 DLR

(AD) 157 and also the Writ Petition submitted on

behalf of the appellant Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan

and Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,

challenging the vires of the Indemnity Repeal Act,

1997 in the High Court Division which has gone



Upto the Appellate Division reported in 3 BLC (AD)

89 has submitted that the accused appellant had

never challenged the jurisdiction of the Court on the



round that it was a case of mutiny leading to mur-

der not a case of murder simplictter and, as such the

appellant’s contention that the civil Court has no

jurisdiction to try the offence of murder is not ten-

able in law. The learned Attorney-General has

drawn our attention to the refusal of the first Judge

in granting leave to make submission on the point of

mutiny since the prosecution has no case of mutiny

but a case of murder committed in the fateful night

of 14th August and the early hours of 15th August,

1975. Mr Mahbubey Alam has also referred to the

conclusions and observations made by the Third

learned Judge. The learned Attorney-General having

drawn our attention to the written statements made

by the convict appellants, namely, Lieutenant

Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar

Rashid Khan and Mohiuddin (Artillery), have sub-

mitted that none of the appellants made any aver-

ment to the effect that murders were committed in

course of mutiny. He has also reiterated the submis-

sions made by Mr Anisul Hug to the same effect that

since in the instant case neither any discretion was

exercised in taking a decision by the prescribed offi-

cer under section 94 of the Army Act nor any ques-

tion was raised by the convict appellants in the trial

Court as to the forum of trial and, as such, the con-

vict appellants are not entitled to challenge the

forum of trial for the first time in the Apex Court. In

this context Mr Attorney-General has referred to the

case of Major EG Barsay vs State of Bombay

reported in AJR 1961 SC 1762. Having referred to

the case of Jamil Hug vs Bangladesh reported in 34

DLR (AD) 125, he has submitted that forum of trial

being governed by a procedural law and the proce-

dure followed in Civil Court is much fairer and

transparent than that the procedure followed in

Court Martial, the question of prejudice to the con-

vict appellant does not arise at all. The offence of

mutiny has not been defined in the Army Act, 1952.

But section 31 of the Army Act provides for punish-

ment for the offence of mutiny and insubordination.

However, mutiny is defined under section 35 of the

Naval Ordinance, 1961. According to section 94 of

the Army Act, a criminal Court under Court Martial

has jurisdiction in respect of a Civil offence and the

prescribed officer has discretion to decide as to

which Court the proceedings shall be instituted and

if that officer decides that the proceedings shall be



            
instituted before the Court Martial then he will

direct that the accused persons shall be detained in

military custody. Sections 94 and 95 of the Army

Act, 1952 and section 549 of the CrPC set out the

procedure in the case of concurrent jurisdiction of

Court Martial and Criminal Court. In this context it

Will be profitable to quote sections 94 and 95 of the

Army Act which are as follows:



“04. When a criminal Court and a Court

Martial have each jurisdiction in respect of a

civil offence, it shall be in the discretion of the

prescribed officer to decide before which Court

the proceedings shall be instituted and, if that

officer decides that they shall be instituted

before a Court Martial, to direct that the

accused person shall be detained in military

custody.



95.(1) When a criminal Court having juris-

diction is of the opinion that proceedings ought

to be instituted before itself in respect of any

civil offence, it may, by written notice, require

the prescribed officer, at his option, either to

deliver over the offender to the nearest magis-

trate to be proceeded against according to law, or

to postpone proceedings pending a reference to

the Government. (2) In every such case, the said

officer shall either deliver over the offender in

compliance with the requisition or shall forth-

with refer the question as to the Court before

which the proceedings are to be instituted for the

determination of the Government, whose order

upon such reference shall be final.”



348. It is also necessary to reproduce section

549 of the CrPC which reads as under:



“549. Delivery to military authorities of

person liable to be tried by Court Martial, (1)

The Government may make rules consistent

with this Code and the Bangladesh Army Act,

1952 (XXXIX of 1952), the Bangladesh Air

Force Act, 1953 (VI of 1953), and the

Bangladesh Navy Ordinance, 1961 (XXXV of

1961), and any similar law for the time being in

force as to the cases in which persons subject to

military, naval or air force law, shall be tried by

a Court to which the Code applies, or by Court

Martial, and when any person is brought before



a Magistrate and charged with an Offer

which he is liable, to be tried either b Nee ig

to which this Code applies or by Court yoo"

such Magistrate shall have regard to sug Arti)

and shall in proper cases deliver him,"

with a statement of the offence of which Bethe,

accused, to the commanding officer Of the Cis

ment, corps, ship or detachment, to Which

belongs, or to the commanding officer of e

nearest military, naval or air force Station, as the

case may be, for the purpose of being tried :

Court Martial. y



(2) Apprehension of such persons. Eve

Magistrate shall on, receiving a written application

for that purpose by the commanding officer of any

body of soldiers, sailors or airman stationeq or

employed at any such place, use his utmost endeay.

ours to apprehend and secure any person accused of

such offence.”



349. From the aforesaid provisions of sections

94 and 95 of the Army Acct it appears that in the case

of murder there is concurrent jurisdiction by both

the Court Martial and the ordinary criminal Cour.

But section 59(2) of the Army Acct stipulates that a

case of murder cannot be tried under the Army Act

if the victims are not subject to the Army Act unless

the accused commits the offence while on active

service or at any place outside Bangladesh or at a

frontier post specified by the Government. It also

appears that application of section 59(1) is also lim-

ited by section 92(2) of the Army Act which pro-

vides that trial shall commence within 6 months

after he had ceased to be subject to this Act. It tra

spires that in the instant case there is concurrent

jurisdiction, the Sessions Court had complied with

all formalities necessary under sections 94 and 95 of

the Army Act and section 549 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure by sending notice to the Chief

of Staff, Army under Rule 2 of Criminal Procedure

Rules (Military Offenders) 1958 with regards to th?

trial of the accused persons as evidenced by ° i"

No.12 dated 3-4-1997. In the case of MSK /bral™

Commander in Chief, Royal Pakistan Navy repo

in 8 DLR (SC) 128 the accused, an official a

Pakistan Navy, was charged with theft and was 

produced before the Special Judge who addressed vi

ter to the Commanding Officer, in accordance with



            
section 549 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

<oction whether the appellant was to be tried by a

eng’ "Martial or the Judge himself. The



0 r anding Officer in reply informed that the



com ed should be tried by Court Martial,

accu



350. Thereafter the Judge handed over the

“ed to the Naval Authority which was chal-

gel 4, Supreme Court held that the Judge was cor-

lente handing over the accused persons to the

reo Authority after receiving reply from the

Nie anding Officer. In the case of Joginder Singh

a machal Pradesh reported in AIR 1971 SC 500

" accused, a Lance Naik, raped a ten years old girl.

a was convicted under section 376 of the Indian

penal Code. The conviction was challenged before

the Appellate Court on the ground that section 549

of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been

complied with. While dismissing the appeal the

Supreme Court of India observed as under:



“In respect of an offence which could be

tried both by a criminal Court as well as Court

Martial, sections 125, 126 and the Rules have

made suitable provisions to avoid a conflict of

jurisdiction between the criminal Courts and the

Court Martial. But it is to be noted that in the

first instance, discretion is left to the officer

mentioned in section 125 to decide before

which Court the proceedings should be institut-

ed. Hence, the officer commanding the army,

army corps, division or independent brigade in

which the accused person is serving or such

other officer as may be prescribed will have to

exercise his discretion and decide under section

125 in which Court the proceedings shall be

instituted. It is only when he so exercises his

discretion that the proceeding should be insti-

tuted before a Court Martial, that the provisions

of section 126(1) come into operation, If the

designated officer does not exercise his discre-

tion and decide that the proceedings should be

nstituted before a Court Martial, the Army Act

Would not obviously be in the way of a criminal

Court exercising it’s ordinary jurisdiction in the

manner provided by law.”



351. In the case of Balbir Singh vs Punjab

n 1995 1 SCC 90, the accused persons

the active service of the Air Force were



convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge under

sections 302 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code. It

was contended on behalf of the accused that since he

was in active service, he should be tried before the

Court Martial, The Supreme Court dismissed. the

appeal and observed as follows:



“When a criminal Court and Court-Martial

each have jurisdiction in respect of the trial of

the offence, it shall be the discretion of the offi-

cer commanding the group, wing or station in

which the accused in serving or such other offi-

cer as may be prescribed, in the first instance, to

decide before which Court the proceedings

shall be instituted and if that officer decides that

they should be instituted before a “Court

Martial”, to direct that the accused persons shall

be detained in Air Force custody. Thus, the

option to try a person subject to Air Force Act

who commits an offence while on “active serv-

ice” is in the first instance with the Air Force

Authorities. The criminal Court, when such an

accused is brought before it, shall not proceed

to try such a person or to inquire with a view to

this commitment for trial and shall give a notice

to the commanding officer of the accused, to

decide whether they would like to try the

accused by a Court Martial or allow the crimi-

nal Courts to proceed with the trial. In case, the

Air Force Authorities decide either not to try

such a person by a Court Martial or fail to exer-

cise the option when intimated by the criminal

Court within the period prescribed by Rule 4 of

the 1952 Rules, the accused can be tried by the

ordinary criminal Court in accordance with the

Code of Criminal Procedure. On the other hand,

if the Authorities under the Act opt to try the

accused by the ‘Court Martial’, the criminal

Court shall direct delivery of the custody of the

accused to the Authorities under the Act and to

forward to the authorities a statement of the

offence of which he is accused. It is explicit that

the option to try the accused subject to the Act

by a Court Martial is with the Air Force

Authorities and the accused has no option or

right to claim trial by a particular forum.”



352. It has been well settled by the Appellate

Division of the Supreme Court in the case of Haider



            
Ali Khan vs State reported in 1994 BLD (AD) 270 =

47 DLR (AD) 47 that the jurisdiction of Court below

cannot be challenged in appeal at a belated stage.

The learmed Attorney-General during the course of

his submission has also drawn our attention to the

cases where appellant Syed Faruque Rahman chal-

lenged the shifting of the Court in Writ Petition

No.2032 of 1997 which was reported in 49 DLR

(AD) 157 and the case of Sultan Shahriar Rashid

Khan and Syed Faruque Rahman which went upto

the Appellate Division reported in 3 BLC (AD) 89

where the accused appellant never challenged the

jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that the mur-

ders were committed in the course of mutiny.



353. From the careful scrutiny of the evidence

of PW 2 namely PW 8 who in cross-examination



Stated that—







354. From careful scrutiny of the aforesaid

statements of the PWs, it appears that the killing for

which the convict appellants and others were con-

victed and sentenced were not done in course of

mutiny. From the judgment of the first Hon'ble

Judge of the Division Bench, we found that there

was no mutiny in the Army in the night following





14th/early morning of 15th August, 1975. The This

learned Judge also came to the same conclusion an

observed as under:



“From all this aforesaid evidences Of the

persons in authority and Army, Navy, Air Fotce

BDR, Police and Rakkhi Bahini having owed

the allegiances and no chain of command Wan

ever disturbed, there was no mutinous situation,

as contemplated in the aforesaid section.



355. It also appears from the written State.

ment that none of the convict appellants, namely,

Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid

Khan, Mohiuddin (Artillery) at the time of examing.

tion under section 342 of the CrPC had made any

averment that the murders were committed in course

of mutiny. The evidences adduced in this case do not

show that the murders were committed in the course

of mutiny rather there was a conspiracy for commit.

ting murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur

Rahman and the members of his family and rela-

tions and that if anything had happened in the Army

it was after the commission of murder. The offence

of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal

Code is not an offence under the Army Act rather it

is a civil offence as defined in section 8(2) of the

Army Act. Sub-section (2) of section 59 of the Army

Act envisages that a person subject to this Act com-

mits an offence of murder, culpable homicide not

amounting to murder or rape in relation to the per-

son not subject to the Army Act shall not be guilty

of an offence against the said Act and shall not be

dealt with under this Act unless he commits any of

the said offences while on active service or at any

place outside Bangladesh or at a frontier post speci-

fied by the Government. When a Criminal Court and

Court Martial have concurrent jurisdiction to try 4

civil offence then under section 94 of the Army Act

it is the discretion of the prescribed Officer to decide

before which Court the proceedings shall be inst!-

tuted, If he decides that it should be instituted before

a Court Martial, then he can direct that the accused

shall be detained in military custody. But in the

instant case, the prescribed officer has neither exe

cised his jurisdiction nor instituted the proceedings

before the Court’ Martial. Furthermore, the convict

appellants did not even raise any objection before

the criminal Court during trial. It is only for the prescribed



            
 officer to decide as to the forum of trial and,

4S guch, in the instant case, neither the prescribed

jcer nor the accused appellant challenged the

fort of the trial, rather in the Appellate Division,

at pelated stage, such a challenge is not tenable in

jaw. Since in the instant case, trial of a civil offence

pefore a criminal Court is found to be legal and valid



gas such, the argument advanced by the defence

is not tenable in law,



356. Chapter 7 of the Penal Code provides for

offences relating to the Army, Navy and Air Force

and specifically, section 139 of the Penal Code pro-

yjges that persons subject to the aforesaid three

services are not subject to punishment under the

penal Code for any of the offences defined in

Chapter 7. Section 5 of the Penal Code makes it

clear that any of the provisions of the Penal Code

does not intend to repeal, vary, suspend or affect any

of the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny



and desertion of officer, soldier or airman in the

service of Republic. So it appears that section 139 of

the Penal Code makes it abundantly clear that none

of the provisions of the Penal Code will repeal, vary

or affect the provision of any other law for punish-

ing mutiny. There is no difficulty for trial for mutiny

by the Court Martial if there is any such necessity. It

is well established that forum of trial is governed by

a procedural Jaw and the procedure followed by a

civil Court is much fairer and transparent then those

followed in the Court Martial and therefore there is

no chance of any prejudice to be caused to the

accused appellant. In the decision of the case of

Jamil Hug vs Bangladesh reported in 34 DLR (AD)

125 at page 138, paragraph 37 the Appellate

Division of the Supreme Court has quoted with

approval the observations of Prof. Holland pub-

lished in Law of Court Martial (Current Legal

Problem 1950 at page 193) which reads as follows:



“It is clear that present attitude of the

Courts whether justified by authority or not is in

favour of abdication controlling authority.

There is accordingly I suggest strong case for

the further reform I would accord-

ingly suggest that the jurisdiction of Court

Martial should be statutorily confined to the

offences against discipline and all the jurisdic-

tion over civil offences should be taken away

except where it is reasonable and impracticable

to arrange for a civil trial.”



357. We find that before pronouncement of

the judgment, the learned Sessions Judge vide his

order dated 24-3-1997 had served notice to con-

cerned authorities and the Army Headquarter as per

Provisions of Criminal Procedural Rules (Military

Offenders) 1958 vide Office Memo dated 2-4-1997

notifying that there is no bar to trying retired army

personnel in the criminal Court and thereby com-

plied with section 94 of the Army Act. So we do not

find any illegality as to the holding of trial before

criminal Court. (i.e. Sessions Court)



358. From the definitions of mutiny as con-

tained in section 35 of the Navy Ordinance, 1961.

we do not find that the prosecution has made out a

case of mutiny or there was any sign of failure of

command leading to mutiny rather from the evi-

dence of the witnesses both the Courts below, i.e.

the Court of Sessions and High Court Division, con-

currently found that the accused persons have com-

mitted conspiracy and murder. But both the Courts

have found that it is a case of murder and not a case

of mutiny leading to murder.



359. In the case of Major EG Barsay vs State

of Bombay reported in AJR 1961 SC 1762, the

Supreme Court of India observed as follows:



“The scheme of the Act therefore is self-

evident. It applies to offences committed by

army personnel described is section 2 of the

Act; it creates new offences with specified pun-

ishments, imposes higher punishments to pre-

existing offences, and enables civil offences by

a fiction to be treated as offences under the Act;

it provides a satisfactory machinery for resolv-

ing the conflict of jurisdiction. Further it

enables, subject to certain conditions, an

accused to be tried successively both by Court

Martial and by a criminal Court, It does not

expressly bar the jurisdiction of criminal Courts

in respect of acts or omissions punishable under

the Act, if they are also punishable under any

other law in force in India; nor is it possible to

infer any prohibition by necessary implica-

tion.”



            
360. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, Mr Abdur

Razaque Khan and Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the

learned Advocates for the appellants have submitted

in unison that the evidence and materials on record

will only show that there was no case of criminal

urder but the case of criminal con-

spiracy to commit mutiny to change the then Mujib

Government. Hence, the conviction and sentence of



accused appellants is liable to be set aside. They

have submitted that the allegation of mutiny carries

y within the defini-



with it the existence of conspirac

tion of the offence of mutiny. Having drawn our

attention to the evidence of witnesses, Mr Khan

Saifur Rahman has submitted that there was a con-

spiracy for mutiny and.not to commit murder of

President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with members of

his family. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman has also

referred to the opinion of the Third learned Judge

and submits that the Third learned Judge comment-

ed on the event of 15th August as revolting one and

the said findings of the Third learned Judge is a find-

ing of the situation as a mutiny obtaining in course

of the occurrence. He has submitted that there is no

direct evidence to the effect that the murder was

intended to be committed by the appellants. He has

also submitted that the places of deployment of

occurrence in the house of Abdur Rab Sherniabat

and Sheikh Fazlul Hug Moni are not included in the

charge and in the fact of the case and in the instant

case there is no account of conspiracy by any of the

co-accused of the case and thereby those places

added to the case events in the course of same trans-

action extending the facts of the case beyond its

place of occurrence are illegal merging of unrelated

evidence with the case and embellishing the case

with unrelated evidence and, as such, the conviction

and sentence of the accused appellants for commit-

ting murder and also for committing criminal con-

spiracy for murder are not tenable in law, Referring

to the decision in the case of Md Shamsul Haque vs

State reported in 20 DLR 540, he has submitted that

when a conspiracy has gone beyond the stage of

conspiracy and offence is committed in pursuance

thereof, then conspiracy becomes irrelevant i.e. no

conviction can be awarded for conspiracy if sub-

stantive offence is committed in pursuance thereof.

Mr Anisul Hug, the learned Advocate for the respon-

dent State, and Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned

Attorney-General, have submitted in unison that in conspiracy of m

the instant case the accused appellants have f,,

rightly convicted under section 120B of the Penal

Code as the charge against them for the gay,

offence of criminal conspiracy was proved beyong

reasonable doubt. Mr Mahbubey Alam has Submit.

ted that in the charge framed against the ACCUsey

appellants, nothing was mentioned about the con,

spiracy to commit the mutiny rather the charge

framed was conspiracy to commit murder, In reply

to the learned Advocate for the appellants, the

learned Attorney-General has submitted that the ey;.

dence of PWs as referred to by the learned defence

lawyer is of two-fold, one is relating to the circum.

stances prior to the occurrence and another is relat.

ed to the circumstance after the occurrence and thys

submitted that the evidence quoted by the learneg

defence Counsel cannot be taken to be an evidence

of mutiny rather it is the evidence of murder which

shall be taken into consideration in deciding the

case. According to the submission of learned

Attorney-General, the evidences on record and cir-

cumstances showed that the first object of the con-

spiracy was to kill Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur

Rahman and members of his family and, according-

ly, the convicts with pre-plan and pre-design came

out to kill Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman

and members of his family at House No.677, Road

No.32, Dhanmondi and to this end they mobilised

force for capturing radio station and other areas of

the city. The learned Attorney-General also asserted

that in the case of conspiracy in most cases direct

evidence is not normally found and it is proved by

the inference drawn from the circumstances and the

acts committed by the perpetrators in pursuance (0

their common design. He has referred to the deci-

sion of Shivnarayan Laxminarayan Joshi vs State of

Moharashtra reported in AIR 1980 SC 439 and

Mohd. Osman Mohammad Hossain Maniyur 8

State of Moharastra reported in AIR 1981 SC 1062.

In reply to the contention of the appellants, that al

the three learned Judges of the High Court Divisio"

discarded the applicability of section 10 of M

Evidence Act and thus prosecution failed to prov’

the existence of criminal conspiracy through

application of section 10 of the Evidence Act, bot

the learned Attorney-General and Mr Anisul 104

have in unison submitted that section 10 of n

Evidence Act only makes certain fact relevant .

the purpose of conspiracy. On a clear reading section







            
10 it appears that it is a Rule of evidence which

makes certain fact i.e. anything said, done or written

by any one of such persons (conspirator) in refer-

ence to their common intention after the time when

such intention was entertained as a relevant fact. In

the case of State of Maharashtra vs Damu Gopinath

shinde reported in AIR 2000 SC 1691, the Supreme

Court of India held that section 10 renders anything

said, done or written by anyone of the conspirators

in reference to their common intention as a relevant

fact, not only as against each of the conspirators but

for proving the existence of the conspiracy itself.

Further, the said fact can be used for showing that a

jcular person was a party to the conspiracy. The

only condition for application of the rule in section 10

is that there must be “reasonable ground to believe

that two or More persons have conspired together to

commit an offence.” The Supreme Court further held

that the basic principle which underlies in section 10

of the Evidence Act is the theory of agency and hence

every conspirator is an agent of his associate in car-

rying out the object of the conspiracy.



361. In reply to the submission of Mr Khan

Saifur Rahman, the learned Advocate for the

accused appellant, the leamed Attorney-General has

submitted that the confessional statement made by

the accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed

Feruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Sultan

Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant Colonel

Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) are true and voluntary

and, as such, those statements should be taken into

consideration. The learned Attorney-General has

further submitted that on the evidence of witnesses,

namely PW 51 and PW 61 and also from the case

record it appears that the findings of the first learned

Judge in respect of section 10 was totally based on

misreading of evidence on record, All of them made

confessions voluntarily. The non-filing up of some

of the columns of the forms of confession by the

recording Magistrate is not fatal. In support of this

Contention he has referred to the case of State vs

Nolini reported in (1999) 5 SCC 353 and the case of

State vs Lalu Miah reported in 39 DLR (AD) ! 17. In

reply to the submissions of learned Advocate for the

appellants to the effect that when a conspiracy has

Bone beyond the stage of conspiracy and offence Is

Committed in pursuance thereof, then conspiracy



becomes irrelevant i.e. no conviction can be award-



MAaJor BAZLUL Hupa vs STATE (MM Hossain J 95



ed for conspiracy if substantive offence is commit-

ted in pursuance thereof. To substantiate his argu-

ment, he has also referred to the decision in the case

of the State of Andhra Pradesh vs Kandimalla

Subbaiah reported in AJR 1961 SC 1241, State of

Kerala vs Sugathan reported in AJR 2000 SC 3323,

Kehar Singh vs State (Delhi Admn) reported in A/R

1988 SC 1883.



362. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, the learned

Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant

Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan,

has placed the relevant portion of the evidence and

submitted that the learned Judges of the Division

Bench erred in law in failing to find out that the

learned Sessions Judge relying on extraneous facts

and circumstances found the accused appellant

guilty under section 120B of the Penal Code without

any specific finding in respect of the said offence,

rather the trial Court relied on inadmissible evi-

dence. He has submitted that there was no legal evi-

dence against the appellant showing his complicity

in the offence of conspiracy. It appears that PW 43

had seen accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel

Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan attending in a meeting

at the house of Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed in the

month of June/July, 1975. After the meeting at the

premises of a Madrasa at Daudkandi the accused

Shahriar, Faruque, Khondker Abdur Rashid also

attended a secret meeting with Khondker Moshtaq

Ahmed, Taheruddin Thakur and others. It is well

established that conspiracy is always hatched in

secrecy. In most cases it is impossible to adduce

direct evidence in proof of conspiracy. In the case of

Shivnarayan Laxminarayan Joshi vs State of

Moharastra reported in AIR 1980 SC 439, Fajal Ali,

J observed that a conspiracy is always hatched in

secrecy and it is impossible to adduce direct evi-

dence of the same. The offence can be only proved

largely from the inferences drawn from acts or ille-

gal omission committed by the conspirators in pur-

suance of a common design.



363. Inthe case of Mohd. Usman Mohammad

Hossain Maniyar vs State of Moharashtra reported

in AJR 1981 SC 1062, at page 1067 para 16 Baharul

Islam, J observed:



“It is true that there is no evidence of any

express agreement between the appellants to do



            
or cause to be done the illegal act. For an

offence under section 120B the prosecution

need not necessarily prove that the perpetrators

expressly agreed to do or cause to be done the

illegal act; the agreement may be proved by

necessary implication. In this case, the fact that

the appellants were possessing and selling

explosive substances without a valid licence for

a pretty long time leads to the inference that

they agreed to do and/or caused to be done the

said illegal act, for, without such an agreement

the act could not have been done for such a long

time.”



364. From a careful scrutiny of the evidence

of the prosecution witnesses and also from the con-

fessional statement made by aforementioned three

accused appellants it appears that the conspiracy

started in the month of March,1975 at BARD,

Comilla, then in the month of June/July, 1975 in the

house of Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed at Doudkandi,

Comilla which was also attended by Lieutenant

Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel

Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Khondaker Abdur

Rashid, Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed,

Taheruddin Thakur and others. Thereafter the con-

spiracy continued in the house of Khondker

Moshtag Ahmed in Agha Masi Lane, Ramna Park,

and subsequently in Balurghat parade ground on the

following night of 14th August, 1975, PW 11, PW

12 and PW 14 in their evidence gave detailed

descriptions about the night parade held on the night

following on 14th August, 1975. At the end of the

night parade, there was conference and briefings by

the accused Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque

Rahman and others. After midnight all the accused

persons and others who were assembling in the

parade ground of the Lancer Regiment and after giv-

ing final task to their conspiracy First Bengal Lancer

Unit with tanks and troops from 2nd Field Artillery

Regiment with cannons and light arms were

deployed in different places in the city ending at



Road No.32, Dhanmondi, Dhaka to commit the

offence. The second learned Judge of the Division

Bench has also considered the evidence of PW 21



PW 22, PW 24, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW

39, PW 40, PW 42 and PW 44 proving conspiracy

against the accused persons. The evidence of PW 21

manifests the preparation in 2nd Field Artillery

Regiment, the evidence of PW 22 shows the Prep,

ration for onslaught and the evidence of pw ,,

shows a retired Resalder of Ist Bengal Lance

Regiment directly participated in the conspiracy, t



365. The second learned Judge having consid,

ered the submissions advanced on behalf of the

accused appellants and respondent rightly found that

PW 25, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW 39, py,

40 and PW 41 had corroborated each other in Prov.

ing conspiracy and participation by the accused per.

sons. All the witnesses also stated in their evideng,

that the accused appellants, namely, Lieutenan

Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colone,

Abdur Rashid and Lieutenant Colonel Sharify

Haque Dalim having addressed the troops of the

Amny indoctrinated them to engage in conspiracy

and launch the operation in furtherance of their

common intention to achieve the ultimate goal in the

early morning of 15th August, 1975. The accused

persons went to different places as per deployment

by Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and

his associates and assembled in those places in order

to commit the illegal act by illegal means and all of

them committed the offence under section 120B of

the Penal Code. It also appears from the evidence of

witnesses that First Bengal Lancer Regiment and



- Two Field Artillery Regiment were indoctrinated



and instigated to do a “special urgent duty in the

interest of the country”.



366. According to the briefings of Lieutenant

Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman troops under the

command of the officers were deployed at the house

of Sheikh Fazlul Haq Moni, Abdur Rob Shemiabal,

Hon’ble Minister of Bangladesh, the radio station.

the Cantonment, distance to the Headquarters ol

Rakkhi Bahini and some were also deployed '

to terrorise the house guards in the residence of the

then President and also to resist the Rakkhi Bahin''!

so required, and Major Bazlul Huda, Major AKM

Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Aziz Pasha went over 

the residence of the President and Resalder Mosle

‘yell-laid and pre-planned conspiracy in order not

 to kill the then President with his family mem-

367. It appears that learmed Judges of the

pivision Bench having examined the judgment and

ondet passed by the leamed Sessions Judge and also

evidence of 16 prosecution witnesses, namely, PW

43, PW 11. PW 12. PW 14, PW 21, PW 22, PW 24,

pw25, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW 39, PW

40, PW 41 and PW 44 found that the prosecution

successfully proved the charge of conspiracy under

section 120B of the Penal Code. Moreover, the sec-

ond leamed Judge having found the confessional

statements made by the accused appellants, namely,

Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,

Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan

znd Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed

(Anillery) true and voluntary admitted the same as

legal piece of evidence and rightly convicted the

accused appellants under section 120B of the Penal

Code and, as such, no interference is called for by

this Hon’ble Court.



Section 120A and 120B of the Penal Code,

1860-Conspiracy:



“120A. When two or more persons agree to

do, or cause to be done,—



(1) an illegal act, or



(2) an act which is not illegal by illegal

means, such an agreement is designated a crim-

inal conspiracy: Provided that no agreement

except an agreement to commit an offence shall

amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some

act besides the agreement is done by one or

more parties to such agreement in pursuance

thereof.”



368. The offence of criminal conspiracy is

committed where there is an agreement by the two

Or more persons to do an illegal act or an act by ille-



gal means in furtherance of their common design.

AD 13



369, The offence of conspiracy like any other

offence can be proved by direct evidence or by cir-

cumstantial evidence but in practice it is extremely

difficult to get direct evidence in proof of conspira-

cy. In the decision of the case of Nur Mohammad

Mohd. Yusuf Momin vs State of Maharashtra report-

ed in AJR 1971 SC 885 LD Dua, J held:



“A conspiracy from its very nature is gen-

erally hatched in secret. It is, therefore,

extremely rare that direct evidence in proof of

conspiracy can be forthcoming from wholly

disinterested quarters or from utter strangers.

But, like other offences, criminal conspiracy

can be proved by circumstantial evidence.

Indeed in most cases proof of conspiracy is

largely inferential though the inference must be

founded on solid facts. Surrounding circum-

stances and antecedent and subsequent conduct,

among other factors, constitute relevant materi-

al. In fact, because of the difficulties in having

direct evidence of criminal conspiracy, once

reasonable ground is shown for believing that

two or more persons have conspired to commit

an offence then anything done by any one of

them in reference to their common: intention

after the same is:entertained becomes, accord-

ing to the law of evidence, relevant for proving

both conspiracy and the offences. committed

pursuant thereto.”



370. In the earlier case of Barindra Kumar

Ghose vs Emperor reported in CWN 1/14, Jenkins, J



observed as follows:



“A conspiracy consists not merely in the

intention of two or more, but in the agreement

of two or more to do an unlawful act, or to do a

lawful act by unlawful means. Though to:estab-

lish a charge of conspiracy there must be agree-

ment, there need not be proof of direct meeting

or combination, nor need the parties be brought

into each other’s presence, The agreement may

be inferred from ciroumstances raising a. pre-

sumption of a common concerted plan to carry

out the unlawful design. Nor is it necessary that

all should have joined in the scheme from the

first; those who come in at a later stage are



equally guilty, provided the agreement be

proved.” [emphasis added]



            
some kind of physical manifestation of are

ment. The express agreement, however, need

not be proved, Nor actual meeting of two Ne

sons is necessary. Nor it is necessary to Prov,

the actual words of communication. The evi

dence as to transmission of thought sharing the



unlawful design may be sufficient.”



371. Sardar Sardul Singh Caveeshar vs State

of Maharashtra reported in AIR 1965 SC 682 the

Supreme Court of India held:



~



“The essence of conspiracy is, therefore,

that there should be an agreement between per-

sons to do one or other of the acts described in

the section, The said agreement may be proved

by direct evidence or may be inferred from acts

and conduct of the parties.”



374, In the case of Suresh Chandra Bahyj 7"

State of Bihar reported in AIR 1994 SC 2429, While

confronted with the contention that there is no direc

illegal evidence against the appellants for their

involvement in conspiracy, the Supreme Cour of

India observed:



372. In the case of Sanjaya Gandhi vs State

(Delhi Admn) reported in AIR 1980 SC 1382 the

Supreme Court of India observed—



pre it is well settled that in order to

prove a criminal conspiracy which is punish-

able wander section 120B of the Indian Penal

Code, there must be direct or circumstantial

evidence to show that there was an agreement

between two or more persons to commit an

offence. This clearly envisages that there must

be 2 meeting of minds resulting in an ultimate

decision taken by the conspirators regarding the

commission of an offence. It-is true that in most

cases it will be difficult to get direct evidence of

an agreement 10 conspire but a conspiracy can

be inferred even from circumstances giving rise

to 2 conclusive or irresistible inference of an

agreement belween two or more persons to

commu! an offence.”



373. In the case of Kehar Singh vs State



(Delhi Admn) reported in AJR 1980 SC 1983,

K Jagannatha Shetty, J observed as follows:



“Generally, a conspiracy is hatched in

Secrecy and it may be difficult to adduce direct

evidence of the same. The prosecution will

often rely on evidence of acts of various parties

to infer that they were done in reference to their

common intention. The prosecution will also

more often rely upon circumstantial evidence.

The conspiracy can be undoubtedly proved by

such evidence direct or circumstantial. But the

Court must enquire whether the two persons are

independently pursuing the same end or they

have come together to the pursuit of the unlaw-

ful object. The former does not render them

conspirators, but the latter does. It is, however

essential that the offence of conspiracy required

some kind of physical manifestation of agreement.



374. In the case of Suresh Chandra Bahri vs Sate of Bihar reported in AIR 1994 SC 2420, while confronted with contention that there is no direct illegal evidence against the appellants for their involvement in conspiracy. 

“Where the conspiracy alleged is with

regard to commission of a serious crime of the

nature as contemplated in section 120B reaq



with the proviso to sub-section (2) of section



120A of the IPC then in that event mere proof

of an agreement between the accused for com-

mission of such a crime alone is enough to

bring about a conviction under section 120B



_ and the proof of any overt act by the accused or

by-any one of them would not be necessary. The

provisions in such a situation do not require that

each and every person who is a party to the con-



spiracy must do some overt act towards the ful-

filment of the object of conspiracy, the essential

ingredient being an agreement between the con-

spirators to commit the crime and if these

requirements and ingredients are established

the act would fall within the trapping of the pro-

visions as contained in section 120B since from

its very nature a conspiracy must be conceived

and hatched in complete secrecy, because other-

wise the whole purpose may be frustrated and it

is common experience and goes without saying

that only in very rare cases one may come

across direct evidence of a criminal conspiracy

'0 commit any crime and in most-of the cases !

is only circumstantial evidence which is avail

able from which an inference giving rise to the

conclusion of an agreement between two °

more persons to commit an offence may

legitimately drawn,” [emphasis added,



375, ‘In the case of State vs Nalini (1999) ;



SCC 253, Quadri, J held that it is not necessary "

all the conspirators should participate from t



            
inception to the end of the conspiracy; some may

! : the conspiracy after the time when such inten-

os was first entertained by any one of them and



ye others may quit from the conspiracy. All of

0" m cannot but be treated as conspirators. Where in

guance of the agreement the conspirators commit



ences individually or adopt illegal means to do a

iecall act which has a nexus to the object of conspir-

cyvall of them will be liable for such offences even

a come of them have not actively participated in the

vomnmission of those offences. . femphasis added]



376. Having considered the decision in the

case of Leo Roy Frey vs Superintendent, District

Jail Amiritsar reported in AJR 1958 SC 119, SR

Das.C.J. explained the offence of conspiracy vis-a-

yjs the substantive offence in the following terms:



“The offence of a conspiracy to commit a

crime is a different offence from the crime that

is the object of the conspiracy because the con-

spiracy precedes the commission of the crime

and is complete before the crime is attempted or

completed, equally the crime attempted or com-

pleted does not require the element of conspira-



cy as one of its ingredients. They are, therefore,

quite separate offences.”



377. In view of the aforesaid decisions we are



of the view that even if the acts of the accused have

gone beyond the stage of conspiracy and the sub-

stantive offence is committed in pursuance thereof,

both the specific charges of substantive offence

along with the charge of conspiracy can be simulta-

neously maintained, inasmuch as either conspiracy

or a substantive offence or both may be proven on

the same fact. Just because a conspiracy is culmi-

nated into a substantive criminal offence does not

render the act of conspiracy a separate and distinct

offence, vitiated or nullified. The act of conspiracy,

having once been committed, crystallises into an

offence under section 120B of the Penal Code,

Which continues to be a criminal offence, notwith-

Standing the subsequent events, if any. Offence

under section 120B, Penal Code is generally co-

extensive with any substantive offence committed

Subsequently. Accordingly, in the instant case,

charge under section 302 and section 120B of the

Penal Code was rightly maintained against the

accused appellants in all the appeals.





378. Matters relating to section 34 of the

Penal Code, 1860= Acts done by several persons in

furtherance of common intention.



It has been asserted by Mr Khan Saifur Rahman

and Mr Abdur Razaque Khan that accused

Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman (Lancer),

Licutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan

and Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed

(Artillery) having not been present at the time of

killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman

and his family members, they cannot be convicted

under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code

because they were not physically present at the

place of occurrence. In this context, it appears that

the accused appellants were separately deployed in

different places, according to their pre-plans and

pre-design in furtherance of the common intention

of all the accused persons, those who were physical-

ly present and those who were not present at House

No. 677, Road No.32, Dhanmondi but the deploy-

ment was done as per their pre-plan‘at various places

in furtherance of their common intention and, as

such, they are also equally guilty of the offences

under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code.



| 379. Section 34 of the Penal Code being a rule

of evidence and not a substantive offence, it is com-

mitted when two or more persons intentionally

commit a criminal act jointly in furtherance of a

common intention of all. Common intention pre-

supposes a prior concert or pre-arranged plan

between the persons participating to commit an

offence. Common intention under section 34 can be

established as an inference from the fact of partici-

pation in the commission of the offence.



380. Inthe case of Rasod Bux vs State report-

ed in 22 DLR (SC) 297, one of the accuseds fired his

gun towards the victim but the appellant fired two

shots in the air. It was contended that the. appellant

had no intention to commit any murder. The judg-

ment and order of conviction and sentence was

affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. While

passing judgment Hamoodur Rahman, J observed in

the following manner:

“There is‘no doubt that to bring a case

within the ambit of section 34, PPC, it is neces-

sary that some overt act .or acts must be established



            
to Jead to the inference that the participa-

tors in the crime acted in pre-concert oF under

some pre-arranged plan but this does not ee

that every participant in the crime must be

shown to have committed the same kind of act.

It is sufficient to show that they joined together

in the commission of a particular act, for then

they must all be deemed to have intended the

natural and inevitable consequences of that act

even if some of them did nothing but merely

helped by their presence the commission of the

act.”



In the case of Tunu vs State of Orissa reported

in 1988 CriLJ 524, BK Behera, J held—



“Common intention is to be gathered from



the acts and conduct of the accused persons pre-

ceding, attending and succeeding the occur-

rence. No doubt, the petitioner, who had stood

on the road and blocked it had not participated

in the actual assault, but his conduct in blocking

the road and forcing PW 14 to stop the car and

thereby facilitating the other two persons to

attack PW 14 would undoubtedly show that he

had shared the common intention with the other

two petitioners to attack and assault PW 14. It is

not necessary that to attract section 34 of the

Code, every person must have assaulted and

caused hurt.” i



381. In the instant case it has been submitted

on behalf of the appellants Lieutenant Colonel Syed

Farugue Rahman (Lancer), Lieutenant Colonel

Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant

Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (2nd Artillery) were not

physically present in the house of the then President

at Road No.32, Dhanmondi during the occurrence

between 4-30 to 5-30 in the early moming of 15th

August, 1975. In this context it would be pertinent

to consider the case of Tukaram Ganpat Pandare vs

State of Maharashtra reported in AIR 1974 SC 5] 4,

where some articles were stolen from the godown



and carried away by a lorry which stopped at a

weigh bridge. There was no evidence about the pres-

ence of the appellants at the scene of offence but he

was found in possession of a duplicate key of the



burgled godown and he was

Hs present at the Weigt

Uridge. R Krishna Lyer, J held— -



“Mere distance from the scene of cr;

bed



cannot exclude culpability under sectio, :

which lays down the rule of joint Tesponsibjt:,

for a criminal act performed by a plurality 2

persons, In Barandra Kumar Ghosh ys Kin

Emperor, (1924) 52 IA 40 = AIR 1925 Pc | ‘

Judicial Committee drew into the crimina| fe

those ‘who only stand and wait.’ This doe; not

mean that some form of presence, near ,,

remote, is not necessary, or that mere Presence

without more, at the spot of crime, spells culpa

bility. Criminal sharing, overt or covert, by

active presence or by distant direction, makin,

out a certain measure of jointness in the com,

mission of the act is the essence of section 34

The act here is not the picking the godown lock

but house-breaking and criminal house trespas;,

This crime is participated in by those operating

by remote control as by those doing physical

removal. Together operating in concert, the

criminal project is executed. Those who supply

the duplicate key, wait at the weigh bridge for

the bread-in and bringing of the booty and later

secrete the keys are participes criminis.”

[emphasis added]



382. In the case of State vs Tajul Islam repon-

ed in 48 DLR 305, commenting on section 34 of the

Penal Code Md Badruzzaman, J observed as under:



“Section 34 does not create any distinct

offence. This section is intended to meet a case

where members of a party acted in furtherance

of the common intention of all but it was diffi-

cult to prove exactly the part played by each of

them, It means that if two or more persons

intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the

same as if each of them had done it individual-

ly, Common intention within the meaning of

this section presupposes a prior concert. There

must be prior meeting of minds to form pre

arranged plan to commit an offence. A common

intention with meeting of minds to commit a"

offence in furtherance of the common intention

invites the application of section 34 of the Penal

Code. In offences involving physical violenc*

normally presence at the scene of the offence °

the offender sought to be rendered liable on tH

Principle of joint liability is necessary but such
is not the case in respect of other offences
where offence consists of diverse acts which
may be done at different time and place,”
