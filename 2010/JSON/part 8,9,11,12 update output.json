      "198. By clause (eb), inserted by the Second Proclamation (Sixth Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. III of 1976) dated May 14, 1976, to the Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, the proviso to Article 38 of the Constitution was omitted.    ",
      "196. Next we shall consider the Proclamation made on November 8, 1975. <br> The Proclamation reads as follows : “ PROCLAMATION The 8th November, 1975. <br> Whereas the whole of Bangladesh has been under Martial Law since the 15th day of August, 1975;  And whereas, Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed, who placed the country under Martial Law, has made over the Office of President of Bangladesh to me and I have entered upon that Office on the 6th day of November, 1975:  And whereas, in. the interest of peace, order, security, progress, prosperity and devel- opment of the country, | deem it Necessary to keep in force the Martial Law proclaimed on the 15th August, 1975;  And whereas, for the effective enforcement, of Martial Law it has become necessary for me to_assume_the powers of Chief Martial Law: Administrator_and_ to appoint_Deput Chief Martial Law Administrators and to make some modifications in the Proclamation of the 20th August, 1975;   Now, therefore, I, Mr Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, President of Bangladesh, do hereby assume the powers of Chief Martial Law Administrator and appoint the Chief of Amny Staff, Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc; the Chief of Naval Staff, Commodore MH Khan, PSN, BN, and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal MG. Tawab, SJ SBt. PSA, BAF., as Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator and declare that— <br> (a) Martial Law Regulations and Orders shall be made by the Chief Martial Law Administrator; <br> (b) all Martial Law Regulations and Orders in force immediately before this Procla- mation shall be deemed to have been made by the Chief Martial Law Administrator and shall continue to remain in force until amended or  repealed by the Chief Martial Law — Administrator; <br> (c) Parliament shall stand dissolved and be deemed to be so dissolved with effect from the 6th day of November, 1975, and general elections of Members of  Parliament shall‘be held before the end  of February, 1977;  <br> (d) the persons holding office as Vice President, Speaker, Deputy Speaker Ministers, Ministers of State, Deput Ministers. and_.Whips, _Immediately before this Proclamation, shall_be                            deemed to have ceased to hold office with effect from the 6th day of November 1975 <br> (e) an Ordinance promulgated by the president shall not be subject to the lim- itation as to its duration prescribed in the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh(hereinafter referred as the Constitution) <br> (f)the provisions of Articls 48 of the Constitution shall remain suspended until further order <br> (g) Part VIA of the Constitution shall stand omitted; <br> (h)the Chief Martial Law Administrator may appoint Zonal or Sub-Martial Law Administrators; <br> (i) I may, by order notified in the official Gazette, amend this Proclamation; <br> (j) this Proclamation shall be a part of the Proclamation of the 20th August, 1975, and the Proclamation of the 20th August, 1975, shall have effect as modified by - this Proclamation  (the underlinings are mine) Some of its salient features are as follows : <br> (i) Mr Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem entered upon the Office of President of Bangladesh on 6th November, 1975, <br> (ii) He assumed the office of the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and appointed three Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators (DCMLA), <br> (iii) Parliament was dissolved with effect  from 6th November 1975 (iv) part VIA of the Constitution was omitted, (v) proclamation dated 8th November, 1975 motified the Proclamation dated 20th August, 1975 and became its part. <br> On consideration of. the above Proclamation, it appears that : <br> (i) Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh, had no lawful authority to enter into the office of President of Bangladesh and to assume the powers of CMLA, which was: beyond the ambit of the Constitution.. <br> (ii) He had no lawful authority to dissolve the Parliament, <br> (iii) Bangladesh was ruled for the next three and half years without any Parliament, by the dictators, as such, lost its Republican character for the said period, <br> (iv) He had. no lawful authority to suspend any provision or omit any part of the Constitution, <br> (v) He had no lawful authority to make any Proclamation, Martial Law Regulation or Order. <br> (vi) Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem violated the Constitution of Bangladesh. <br> (vii) He acted as a usurper in entering the Office of the President and in assuming the powers of CMLA. <br> Part XX (C) Second Proclamation (Third Amendment) Order, 1975 <br> By clause gb, added by the Second Proclamation, (Third Amendment) Order, 1975 (Second Proclamation Order No. III of 1975) dated December 31, 1975, to the Proclamation dated - November 8, 1975, the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 (PO No. 8 of 1972), was omitted from the First Schedule to the Constitution.   ",
      "195. On consideration of the above noted Proclamation it appears that—. a (i). Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed had no lawful authority to seize the office of President of Bangladesh; as such, he was anusurper, <br>                          (ii) He had no authority to suspend any pro- vision of the Constitution, <br> (iii) He had no authority to make any Proclamation, Martial Law Regulation or Order, beyond the ambit of the Constitution. <br> (iv) He destroyed the supremacy of the Constitution by making it subject to the Proclamation, Martial Law Regulation and Order. <br> (v) He ousted the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, one of the three pillars of the State. <br> (vi) The Proclamations etc. were made non justiciable before the Court of law, as such, the concept of the Rule of law was destroyed.  Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed and his collabo- rators by these actions violated and disgraced the Constitution and thereby committed the offence of sedition against the Republic of Bangladesh:   ",
      "194.  First, the Proclamation issued on August 20, 1975, narrated earlier. By this Proclamation, Martial. Law was imposed in Bangladesh with effect from August 15, 1975.Some of its salient features are as follows: <br> (i) Certain provisions of. the Constitution were suspended and modified, <br> (ii) The Proclamation, the Martial Law Regulations and Orders became effective in spite of the Constitution or other laws. <br> (iii) The Constitution remained in force but subject to the Proclamation, the Martial Law Regulations and Orders, <br> (iv) No Court including the Supreme Court would have any power to call in question the Proclamation, ~Martial . Law Regulations or Orders.  In reply to our query as to who blessed Khondaker Mushtaque Ahmed with the above noted powers, the learned Additional Attorney-General was without any reply save and except that the said Proclamation was ratified and validated by the Second Parliament.  ",
      "193. Let us now consider the Proclamations and some of the Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders, made thereunder, the copies of which are made available to us.  ",
      "192. Be that as it may, there may be divergent of opinions in the national politics of a democratic country. It is neither unnatural nor unheard of, But it was an out and out political issue and ought to have been settled either politically or legally. But Martial Law was definitely not the answer as if Martial Law is a multiparty democratic system. Rather, Khonda- ker Mostaque Ahmed and his renegades captured the State power for their own evil design and Fourth Amendment was not shown as an excuse for Martial Law, even by them.  ",
      "191. In the 17th century King Charles I was beheaded at the instance of Lieutenant General Oliver Cromwell but this could not be accepted by the English people. Even after his death in 1658, they punished him for his treasonous acts. After restoration In 1660, the body of Oliver Cromwell was exhumed and was subjected to the ritual of a posthumas execution on January 30, 1661.Even if we go further backwards in the history, the assassi- nation of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C was never approved even by the Romans and Marcus Junius Brutus was charged with treason. He fled from Rome and subsequently committed suicide,  ",
      "190. The Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, came into operation on December 16 1972.This Constitution provided for a parliamentary form of Government. Under this constitution the first general election of the country was held in 1973 and one of the political parties secured almost all the parliamentary seats in the National Assembly out of the. total 300 seats. Virtually it had already became a one party Parliament without almost no opposition. After the fourth Amendment all the existing political parties joined the said National Party. We asked the learned additional Attorney-General as to why the ruling party inspite of its such majority became one of many, but he could not explain. However, the Fourth amendment was @ political decision and it ought to have been faced politically. But this amendment was opposed only by two or three members of the Parliament as submitted by the learned Additional Atormey-General ‘himself. Besides, this amendment could have been challenged in Court, even that.was not done. Assassination of the President or declara- tion of Martial Law is not a very novel way to secure repeal of such an amendment of the Constitution. It might be a new innovation but it is neither demo- cratic nor morally right or a legal way to change a legally elected Government.  ",
      "189. His first contention, namely, the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, is not the subject matter of this Rule. Still, in order to consider and appreciate the contention of the learned Additional Attorney-General in this respect) we would refer to it but briefly,                             ",
      "188. We specifically asked the learned Additional Attorney-General that under what provi- sion of the Constitution, Khondaker Mushtaque Ahmed assumed: the office of the. President of Bangladesh. The learned Additional Attorney- General could not give any straight answer. He con- tended firstly that Fourth Amendment of the Constitution made such changes. necessary, besides. he submitted, those actions, in any case, were rali- fied by the Parliament by enacting the Filth Amendment of the Constitution.

Before considering the above mentioned  paragraph 18 to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitu- tion, we would familiarize ourselves as to some of  the Proclamations and MLRs and MLOs which  were sought to be ratified and validated by the sec ond Parliament.  On our queries as to which Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and proceedings were ratified by the Fifth Amendment, the learned Additional General referred to the Proclamation dated August 20, 1975, Proclamation dated Novem- ber 8, 1975, Proclamation dated November 29, 1976.We were also informed on our queries - that Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed became the President of Bangladesh on and from the morn ing of the 15th August, 1975.He nominated                            Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, the then Chief Justice of Bangladesh, as the President of Bangladesh on November 06, 1975.By the Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, Justice sayem proclaimed himself as the cet Martial Law Administrator and appointe the Deputy chief Martial Law Administrators. From time to time, 4 number of Proclamation Orders, MLRs and MLOs were issued. By the Procla- mation dated November 29, 1976, the office of the Martial Law Administrator was handed over to Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc and he became the Chief Martial Law Administra- tor, In due course, Justice Sayem on April 21,1977, nominated Major General Ziaur Rah- man, BU, to become the President of Bangla- desh. On becoming the President of Bangla- desh, Proclamation (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977) was made on April 23, 1977.We also found that the Referendum Order, 1977 (Martial Law Order No. 1 of 1977) was made on May 1, 1977, fol- lowed by the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978 and many others. There were a num- ber of Martial Law Regulations and Orders, the details of which could not be furnished either by the learned Additional Attorney-General or by the learned Advocate for the petitioners. However, from them we could gather that more than two hundred and fifty MLRs and MLOs Were made in pursuance to the above mentioned Proclamations and that those above mentioned Proclamations and all other MLRs and MLOs and the proceedings and actions taken thereon were sought to be ratified and validated by the Fifth Amendment.  Part XX (A) The Proclamation On August 20, 1975  Let us first consider the Proclamation dates 20, 1975.It reads as follows :  <br> “PROCLAMATION The 20th August, 1975, <br> Whereas I, Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed, with the help and-mercy of the Almighty Allah and relying upon the blessings of the people, have taken over all and full powers of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh with effect from the morning of the 15th August, 1975...  And whereas, I placed, on the morning of the 15th August, 1975, the whole of Bangladesh under Martial Law by a declaration broadcast from all stations of Radio Bangladesh;  And whereas, with effect from the morning of the 15th August, 1975, Lhave suspended the provisions of article 48, in so far as it relates of election of the President'of Bangladesh, and article 55 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, and modified the pro- visions of article 148 thereof and form I of the Third Schedule thereto to the effect that the oath of office: of the President of Bangladesh shall be administered_by the Chief Justice of Bangladesh and that the president may enter upon office before he takes the oath;  Now, thereof, 1, Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed, in exercise of all powers enabling me in this behalf, do hereby declare that— <br> (a) 1 have assumed and entered upon the office of the President of Bangladesh with effect from‘the: morning of the 15th August, 1975;  <br> (b) I may’ make, “from time to time, Martial Law Regulations and Orders- (i) providing for setting up Special Courts or Tribunals for the trial and punishment of any offence under such Regulations or Orders or for ‘contravention thereof, and of offences under any other law; <br>                          (ii) prescribing penalties for offences under such Regu- lations or Orders or for contra- vention thereof and special penalties for offences under any other law; <br> (iii) empowering any Court or Tribunal to try and punish any offence under such Regulation or Order or the contravention thereof; <br> (iv) barring the jurisdiction of any Court or Tribunal from trying any offence specified in such Regulations or Orders; <br> (c)I may rescind the declaration of Martial Law made on the morning of the 15th August, 1975, at any time, either in respect of the whole of Bangladesh or any part thereof, and may again place the whole of Bangladesh or any part thereof under Martial Law by a fresh declaration; <br> (d)this Proclamation and the Martial Law Regulations and Orders made by me in’ pursuance thereof shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh or in any law for the time being in force; <br> (e)the Constitution of the_ People’s Republic of Bangladesh shall, subject to this Proclamation and the Martial Law Regulations and Orders made by me in pursuance thereof, continue to remain in force; <br> f()all Acts, Ordinance, President’s Orders and other Orders, Proclamations rules, regulations, bye-laws, notifications and other legal instruments in force on the moming of the 15th August, 1975, shall continue to remain in force until repealed, revoked or amended ; <br> (g) no Court including the Supreme Court or tribunal or authority shall have any pwer to call in question in  any manner whatsoever or declare ille gal or void this Proclamation or any Martial Law Regulation or Order made by me in pursuance thereof, or any dec- laration made by or under this Proclamation, or mentioned in this Proclamation to have been made or anything done or any action taken by or under this Procla-mation, or Mentioned in this Procla-mation to have been done or taken, or anything done or any action taken by or under any Martial Law Regulation or Order made by me in pursuance of this Proclamation ; <br> (h) I may, by order notified in the official Gazette, amend this Proclamation,  (The underlinings are mine)  It appears that on the 15th August, 1975. Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed, seized all and full powers of the Government of Bangladesh and assumed and entered upon the office of the President of Bangladesh. We shall first consider the legal posi- tion in this respect.  ",
      "186. Besides, by section 2 of the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, paragraph 18 was added to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution. This addition was done predominantly in order first- ly, to validate all Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders and other laws made during the period: between the August 15, 1975 and the April 09, 1979; secondly, to validate all actions and proceedings taken in pursuance to those laws during the said period, and thirdly, to protect those actions and proceedings taken in pursuance to the above Proclamations etc from being called in question before any Court on any ground whatsoev er.  ",
      "185. It appears that by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977, the English text of a new paragraph, among others, paragraph 3A was inserted in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution. Its Bengali ver. sion was inserted by the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978.  ",
      "184. It may be reiterated here that this new nation plunged into a disaster and a Constitutional crisis when in'the early morning of August 15, 1975, the President of Bangladesh with his family mem- bers were brutally killed by a section of the army officers and Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed in con- spiracy with them seized the office of the President of Bangladesh. Bangladesh was ruled by Martial Law Proclamations for nearly the next 4(four) years. The said whole period of Martial Law was sought to be validated by insertion of Paragraphs 3A and 18 in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "183. The lofty ideals of liberty, dreamt of and after a long and prolonged uncertain war of inde- pendence, penned down in the Constitution by its framers, was again rekindled in the forceful lan- guage of Justice Davies in this case nearly ninety years after the Declaration of Independence. The civil war which was uncertain like any other war, though threatened the very existence of the Republic but that did not deter the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States to uphold the ideals of liberty and democracy as enshrined in the Constitu- tion even in the face of so very lucrative argument in favour of Martial Law and the trial by the military commission. The Supreme Court inspite of the rag- ing civil war in and around Indiana refused to recog- nise martial law in the said State since the normal Courts were still functioning and an offender could very well be brought before the Court there for trial under the law. It is only when because of existence of such a state of war that normal trial could not be held as the Courts were already closed only then and then only, martial rule could be exercised but for a very limited period and that also as regulated by Congress, the upholder of civil rule and authority, This decision is a gift of the Supreme Court to the people of the United States. This is a bulwark for the protection of the liberties of its citizens.    ",
      "182. Mr Justice Davis delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court. We quote the relevant potion of the opinion from sases and Martial on Cons titutional Law (1952 Revision) :by Professor John P Frank, at page-258 -265 : <br> No graver question  was ever considered by this court nor one which more nearly concerns the rights of the whole people for it is the birth right of every  American citizen, when charged with crime be tried and punished according to law.....,, the protection of the law human rights are secured; withdraw that protection, and they are | at the mercy of wicked rulers, or the clamor of an_excited people. If there was law to justify, this military trial, it is not our province to inter fere; if there was not, it is our duty to declare the nullity of the whole proceedings. The deci- sion of this question does not depend on argu- ment or judicial precedents, numerous and highly illustrative as they are. These precedents. inform us of the extent of the struggle to pre serve liberty and to relieve those in civil life from military trials. The founders of our gov ernment were familiar with the history of that struggle and secured in a written constitution every right which the people had wrested from power during a contest of ages By that Constitution and the laws authorized by it this question must be determined  Time has provern the discernment of our ancestors; for even these provisions, expressed in such plain English word, that if would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them are                           now after the lapse of more than seventy years, sought to be avoided. Those great and good men foresaw that troublous times would arise when rulers and people would become restive under restraint and seek by sharp and decisive measure to accomplish ends deemed just and proper and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril unless established by irrepeable law. The history of the world had taught them that what was done in the past might be attempted in the future. The Constitutu- ion of the US is a law for rulers and people equally in was and in peace and covers with the shield of its protection all classed of men at all times and under all cicumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious conse- quences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of govern- ment. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism, but the theory of necessity on which it is based is false: for the government within the Constitution, has _all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve its existence; as has been happily proved by the result of the great effort to throw off its just authority...... <br> It is claimed that martial law covers with its broad mantle the proceedings of this military commission. The proposition is this; that in a time of war the commander of an armed force (if in his opinion the exigencies of the country demand it, and of which he is to judge), has the Power within the lines of his military district, to suspend all civil rights and their remedies, and subject citizen as well as soldiers to the rule of his will; and in the exercise of his lawful authority cannot be restrained, except by his superior officer or the President of the United States.  The statement of this proposition shows its importance; for if true republican government is a failure and there is an end of liberty regu lated by law. Martial Law, established on such a  basis destroys every guarantee of the Constitution and effectually renders the mili tary independent of and superior to the civil power the attempt to do which by the King of Great Britain was deemed by out fathers such as offense. that they assigned it to the world as one of the causes which impelled them to declare their independence. Civil liberty and this kind of martial law cannot endure together the antagonism is irreconcilable and in the conflict one or the other must perish the illustrious men who framed that instrument were guarding the foundations of civil liberty against the abuses of unlimited power: they were full of wisdom, and the les- sons of history informed them that a trial by an established Court, assisted by an impartial jury, was the only sure way of protecting the citizen against oppression and wrong. Knowing this, they limited the suspension to one great right, © and left the rest to remain forever inviolable. But, it is insisted that the safety of the country in time of war demands that this broad claim for martial law shall be sustained. If this were true it could be well said that a coun reserved a the sacrifice of all the cardinal principles of lib- erty, is not worth the cost of preservation. Happily, it is not so, .As necessity creates the rule, so it limits_its duration: for, if this government_is continued after the courts are reinstated it is a gross usurption of pwer. Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their juris- diction. It is also confined to the locality of actual war, Because, during the late Rebellion it could have been enforced in Virginia, where the national authority was overturned and the courts driven out, it does ‘not follow that it should obtain in Indiana, where that authority was never disputed, and justice was always administered. And so in the case of a foreign invasion, martial rule may become a necessity in one state when in another it would be <br>                          “mere lawless violence.” (The underlinings are mine)  After this judgment, Milligan was released in April, 1866.  In March, 1868, he successfully brought an action for damages against General Hovey for unlawful imprisonment.  ",
      "181. Milligan, a civilian resident of Indiana, was a Southern sympathizer, On an allegation of treason against the Northern America he was arrest- ed on October 5, 1864 and on the orders of General Hovey, he was tried by a military commission and sentenced to be hanged on May 19, 1865.  On a Writ of habeas corpus, the following three questions were before the Supreme Court of the United States : <br> (i) Whether the Court had jurisdiction in view of legislation suspending the writ of habeas corpus; <br> (ii) Whether the military had jurisdiction to try him; <br> (iii) Whether Milligan should be dis- charged.  This was a time when civil war was raging for more than three years and the very existence and foundation of the Republic was severly threatened Even in that trying and precarious situation the Hon’ ble Judges of the Supreme Court did not relent from upholding the fundamental principles of the Constitution in obedience to their oath and held that Congress was without Constitutional authority to suspend the privilege of habeas Corpus and to allow exercise of Martial law in the State of Indiana where there was no rebellion at the relevant time  ",
      "180. The famous case of ex parte Milligan 71 US (4 Wall) 2, 18 L Ed. 281 (1866), glorified the rights of people even during war,  ",
      "179. In the beginning of the civil war, Presi- dent Lincoln without waiting for any congressional recognition of the State of war, swiftly ordered blocked of the seceding States on April 19, 1861. The Congress, however, formally declared war to exist on July 13 and validated retroactively the acts of the President prior to that date.  ",
      "178. Although under the Constitution, it is for the Congress to declare war but when a civil war is in existent, it may be recognized as such by the President of the United States, the Chief executive of the country, even without a congressional decla-  ration, depending on the gravity and exigencies of the situation. °  ",
      "177. Even immediately after the war is termi- nated and the general legislative power is absent, the US Supreme: Court held. in the case of Dooley vs United States 182 US 222, that though prior to the                           treaty of peace, the military commander might, as a belligerent right, levy customs duties on goods com- ing into Porto Rico from the United States, after that ‘date he no longer had the authority, ( Quoted from Willoughby at page-1583-84).  ",
      "176. In outlining the general principles gov- erning the powers and authority of military officers, Teney CJ held in Mitchell vs Harmony 13 How 115):  <br> “There are,” he said, “occasions where pri-  vate property may lawfully be taken possession _of or destroyed to prevent it from falling into the hands of the public enemy, and also where a military officer charged with a particular duty may impress private property and take it for public use............066 It is not enough to show that he exercised an honest judgment, and took the property to promote the public service, he _ must also prove what the nature of the emer- gency was, or what he had reasonable grounds to believe it to be; and it will then be for the Court and jury to say whether it was so pressing as to justify an invasion of private right. Unless this is established, the defense must fail because it is very clear that the law will not permit pri- vate property to be taken merely to insure the success of an enterprise against a public enemy. _.. It can never be maintained that a military officer can justify himself for doing an unlaw- ful act, by producing the order of his superior. The order plliate but it cannot justify.” . (The underlinings are mine)  (Quoted from Willoughby, Page-1597),  In the case of Raymond vs Thomas 9] US 712, the attempt of a ‘military commander to annul a decree of a Court was declared void.  ",
      "175. The Legislature of Rhode Island placed the State under Martial Law following Dorr’s Rebilion Lurther was a Dorr supporter, he brought an action against Borden for breaking and entering his house. Borden's defence was that he being a member of a militia acted under orders. In the case of Luther vs Borden 7 How I (1849). Teney CJ of US Supreme court gave his opinion : <br> \"Unquestionably a military government established as the permanent gevernmetn of the  State would not be a republican government  and it would be the duty of Congress to over throw ir and unquestionably a State may use its military power to putdown an armed insurrection too strong to be controlled by the civil authority No more force however can be used that is necessary to accomplish the object. And if the power is exer- cised for the purposes of oppression, and any injury wilfully done to person or property the party by whom, or by whose order_it is com- mitted, would undoubtedly be answerable.” (The underlinings are mine)  (Quoted from: Willoughby Para-1048, Page-1593-94).  ",
      "174. In delineating the role of an armed force in aid of the civil authorities, the Court in Ela vs Smith [5 Gray (Mass) 121], said,  While thus recognizing the authority of  the civil officers to call out and use an armed                           force to aid suppressing a riot or tumult actu- ally existing or preventing one which is threat- ened it must be borne in mind that no power is conferred on the troops when so assembled to  act independently of the civil authority.. They are to act as an armed police only subject to the absolute and exclusive control and direction of the magistrates and other civil officers desig nated in the statue as to the specific duty or service which they are to perform. Nor can the magistrate delegate his authority to the military force which he summons to his aid; or vest in the military authorities an iscretion ower to take any steps Or do any act to prevent or sup- press a mob or riot. They must perform only such service, and render such aid, as is required by the civil officers....It does not follow from this, however, that the military force is to be taken wholly out of the control of the proper officers. They are to direct its movements in the execution of the orders given by the civil offi- cers, and to manage the details in which a spe- cific service or duty is to be performed. But the service or duty must be first prescribed and des- ignated by the civil authority.” (from Willoughly-page 1591(foot note).  (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "173. The American experience and the legal position of Martial Law has been dealt with by Professor Westel Woodbury Willoughby in his cele brated treatise .on the Constitutiong) Law of the United States (Second Edition), In Vol. III at page—1586, Martial Law has been dealt with in this manner:  <br> “1041.Martial Law Defined.  In the most comprehensive Sense of the term, Martial Law includes al] law that has ref erence to, or is administered by, the military forces of the State. Thus it includes (1) Military Law Proper, that is, the body of dministrative laws created by Congress for the government of the army and navy as an organized force: (2) the principles governing the conduct of military forces in time of was and in the government of occupied territory and 3 Martial Law in sensu strictiore or that law which has application  when the military arm does not supersede civil authority but is called upn to aid it in the exe cution of its civil function <br> 1042.Martial Law, in Sensu Strictiore. is a Form of the Police Power  As the Supreme Court in US vs Lee speaking through Justice Miller declared:  No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance. with impunity. All the offi cers of the Government from the highest to the lowest are creatures of the law and are bound to obey it. It is the only supreme power in our sys tem of government and every man who by accepting office participated in its functions is only the more strongly bound to submit to the supremace and to observe the liabilities which it imposed upn the exercise of the authority which it gives (106 US 196)  ",
      "172. AV Dicey in his celebrated treatise ‘An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution,. Tenth Edition-1959, dealt with the . concept of Martial Law at page-287 in this manner :  “Martial law,” in the proper sense of that term, in which it means the suspension of ordi- nary law_and the temporary government of a country or parts of it by military tribunals , is unknown to the law of England  Martial-law is sometimes employed as a name for the common law right of the Crown and its servants to repel force by force in the case of invasion, insurrection, riot, or generally of any violent resistance.to the law. This right,                           or power, is essential. to the very existence of orderly government, and is most assuredly rec- ognized in the most ample manner by the law of | England. It is a power which has in itself no special connection with the existence of an armed force.  It is also clear that a soldier has, as such, no exemption from liability to the law for his con- duct_in restoring order. Officers, magistrates, soldiers, policemen, ordinary citizens, all occu- py in the eye of the law the same position; ...... ... .they_are, each and all of them, liable to be called. to account before a jury for the use of excessive, that is, of unnecessary force: ....... Nothing better illustrates the noble energy with which judges have maintained the rule of regu- lar law, even at periods of revolutionary vio- lence, than Wolfe Tone’s Case. In 1798, Wolfe Tone, an Irish rebel, took part in a French inva- sion of Ireland: The man-of-war in which he sailed was captured, and Wolfe Tone was brought to trial before a court-martial in Dublin. ‘He was thereupon sentenced to be hanged. He held, however, no commission as an English | Officer, his only commission being one from the French Republic. On the morning when his exe- cution was about to take place application was made to the Irish King’s Bench or a writ of habeas corpus. The ground taken was that Wolfe Tone, not being a military person, was not subject to punishment by a court-martial, or, in effect, that the officers who tried him were attempting illegally to enforce martial law. The Court of King’s Bench at once granted the writ, When it is remembered that Wolfe Tone’s sub- stantial guilt was admitted, that the court was made up of judges who detested the rebels, and that in 1798 Ireland was in the midst of a revo- lutionary crisis, -it will be admitted that no more splendid assertion of the supremacy of the law can be found than the protection of Wolfe Tone by the Irish Bench.” (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "171. The judicial view on Martial Law has been aptly explained in the case of Tilonko vs Attorney-General of Natal (1907) AC 93.Lord Halsbury LC held at page-94: <br> “It is by this time a very familiar observa- tion that which is called “martial law” is no law at all. The notion that “martial law” exists by reason of the proclamation- an expression which the learned counsel has more than once used-is an entire debusion. The right to admin- ister force against force in actual war does not depend upon the proclamation of Martial Law at all. It -depends upon the question whether there is war or not. If there is war, there is the right to repel force by force,............ But to attempt to make these proceedings of so-called “courts martial,” administering summary jus- tice under the supervision of a military com-. mander, analogous to the regular proceedings of Courts of Justice is quite illusory.  (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "170. It is apparent in all those cases that the Martial Law was applied in a very restricted way on due approval from Parliament and the civilian authority.  ",
      "169. Possibly the last time the Martial Law was applied in England in 1780 when serious dis- turbance and troubles broke out. Lord Chancellor Thurloe sought justification in this way : <br> “In all cases of high treason, insurrection, and rebellion within the Realm, it was the pecu- liars office of the Crown to use the most effectu- al means of resisting and quashing such insur- rection and rebellion, and punishing the instru- Ments of it. But the King, any more than the pri- vate person, could not supersede the law, nor any act contrary to it and therefore he was bound to take care that the means he used for putting an end to the Rebellion and Insurrection were legal and constitutional and the Military employed for that purpose were every one of them amenable to the law, because no word of command from their particular officer no direc tion from the War Office or Order of Council could warrant or sanction their action illegally. (Quoted from Legal Aspect of Martial Law at page-21). (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "168. We also quote the speech of the Duke of Wellington from the aforesaid book at page — 3 : <br> “The Duke of Wellington’s Speech in the House of Lords on April 1, 1851 quoted in Clode’s Military Forces of The Crown, Vol.II,502 — “As to the remark which had been made about him, he would say word in expla- nation. He contended that Martial Law was nei- ther more nor less than the will of the General who commands the army. In fact, Martial Law meant no law at all....... an  ",
      "167. Blackstone said with regard to Martial Law in this manner : <br>                           Martial Law is built on no settled princi- ples but is entirely arbitrary in its decisions, and is in truth no law, but something indulged rather than allowed as law, a temporary exer- scence bred out of the distemper of the State and not any part of the permanent and perpetu- al laws of the kingdom. The necessity of order and discipline is the only thing which can give it countenance and therefore it ought not to be permitted in time of peace when the King’s courts are open for all persons to receive justice according to the law of the land.” (Quoted from Legal Aspect of Martial Law Page-1).  ",
      "166. The subject of Martial Law has been extensively dealt with by FKMA Munim, our late Chief Justice, in his book titled ‘Legal Aspects of | Martial Law (1989)’. The author quoted from me  authorities on the subject. We also cited some of those quotations from the said book as the oiriginal books are not readily available. This we have done in order to highlight the legal concept of Martial law from by gone days.  ",
      "165. This Petition of Right was subsequently | superseded by the Bill of Rights, 1689.  ",
      "164. In 1628, during the reign of Charles I, The Petition of Right was enacted. This Act nearly four hundred years ago, glorified the rights and lib- erties of the subjects in the then En VIII of the said Act forbidden trial of an subject by Martial Law. The relevant Portion of Clause VII, dealt with Martial Law, reads as follows:   VIII ... and that no freeman in any such manner as is before mentioned be imprisoned or detained; and that your Majesty will be pleased to remove the said soldiers and mariners, and that your People may not be so burdened in time to come; and that the foresaid commissions, roceedin by martial law may be revoked and annulled; and that hereafter  no commissions of like nature may issue forth to any person or persons’ whatsoever to be exe. cuted as aforesaid, lest by colour of them any of  your Majesty’s subjects be destroyed or put to  death contrary to the laws and franchise of the land.” (The underlinings are mine)  ‘(Quoted from Thomas Pitt Taswell- Langmead: English Constitutional History, | Tenth Edition, 1946),  In support of the Bill, Seldon, Coke, Littleton, Digges, Noy and other eminent lawyers of the day | argued on the part of the Commons while the Attorney-General Heath, Serjeant Ashley and others | acted as counsel -for the Crown. Besides, Charles | also consulted Chief Justices Hyde and Richardson. | On 7th June, 1628, the King signified the royal | assent—‘soit droit fait comme est desire.’  ",
      "163. Now let us consider the concept of Martial Law. The learned Additional Attorney- General and Mr Akhtar Imam called it Martial Law Jurisprudence or Martial Law Culture in Bangla- desh. Bangladesh is comparatively a new nation, so also its armed forces. As such, we would hark back to legal history predominantly of England. It appears that during the reign of Mary in 1557, rebels were executed according to martial law. In 1595, during the reign of Elizabeth I, Sir Thomas Wyllford was appointed provost-marshal and some riotous Persons were executed as traitors by martial law, But even in those days martial law was applied under the civil authority of the Monarch.  ",
      "162. This fundamental principle to serve the people must be engraved in the minds of all Functionaries and all persons in the service of the Republic.  No wonder, one of the greatest President on Earth, while dedicating a portion of the battle- field at Gettysburg, for the fallen heroes, pro- claimed ‘that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from_the earth’.   ",
      "161. From the above it would appear that the defence services are the creation of the Constitution like other services. Each service has got its respec- tive and specific duties, purposes and functions, The one purpose is common. It is to serve the people. That is the most fundamental and prime object of all the services in Bangladesh. The defence services are no exception. The Constitution created those servic- es not for any other purpose but in order to serve the Nation and its people. In this connection it should be engraved in our minds that the ‘people’ creates the Nation, the people builds the Nation. It is the people who makes supreme sacrifices for the creation of their Nation, It is the people for which a Nation exists. It is the people for which. all ‘services’ are                           required and are created by the Constitution. It is the people for which all high functionaries of the Republic do exist. Those high functionaries are cre- ated not for staying in ivory towers, rather they are created, so that they can serve the people better. The people do not exist for them, rather, they including the Judges exist for the people and only for the peo- ple, however humble their station of life may be. The greatness of the State-functionaries depends not on their status or rank but how much and how far they can serve their people.  ",
      "160. besides, the defence services Owe its existence to the Constitution and also owe its absolute loyalty to the Constitution like any other service of the Republic and bound to obey its edicts to the letter. Article 62 of the Constitution provides for raising and maintenance of defence services. Article 62 as follows: <br> “62(1) Parliament shall by law provide for regulating—  <br> (a)the raising and maintaining of the defence services of Bangladesh and Of their reserves;  <br> (b) the grant of commissions therein; (c) the appointment of chiefs of staff of the defence services, and their salaries and allowances; and (d)the discipline and other matters relating to those services and reserves, <br> (2) Until Parliament by law provides for the matters specified in clause (1) the President may, by order, provide for such of them as are not already subject to exist- ing law.” .   But the supreme command of the defence serv- ices of Bangladesh is vested in the President. Article 61 reads as follows: <br> “The supreme command of the defence services of Bangladesh shall vest: in the President and the exercise thereof shall be reg- ulated by law and such law shall, during the period in which there is a Non-Party Care-taker Government under article 58B, be administered by the President.”  Besides, in case of grave emergency, threaten- ing the security or economic life of Bangladesh, the President, with the advice of the Prime Minister, may even declare an emergency in the country under Article 141A.  ",
      "159. But at the same time, it should be remem- bered that they are not foreign legions, they are the citizens of this country and are raised from amongst the People of this country, They are sons of the soil.  ",
      "158. The defence services of Bangladesh are ogans of the Republic, an important one. Because, itdefend the country and protect its frontiers. The members of the forces are expected to be alert to face any emergency. Of necessity, they must. main- lin a very high degree of discipline so that they remain always equipped and prepared to serve the Cause of the country and its people.  ",
      "157. Again, the relevant portion of Section 2 under Article II reads: “section 2.The President shall be com- mander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, When called into the actual service of the United States; he may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in cach of the executive departments, upon any subject relat- ing to the duties of their respective officers and he shall have power to grant reprieves and par- dons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.”  Similar is the position in most of the countries with written Constitutions including Bangladesh.  ",
      "156. Article 1 describes the powers of the  Congress of the United States.   The relevant:-portion of Section 8 under Article I reads : <br> \"Section 8 ................  To declare War, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water;  To raise and support Armies, but no appro- priation of money to that use shall be for | longer term than two years; To provide and maintain a Navy; _ To make rules for the government and reg- ulation of the land and naval forces; To provide for calling forth the vine execute the laws of the union, suppress insur rections and repel invasions;  To provide for organizing, arming and dis- ciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia accord-                           ing to the discipline prescribed by Congress... ...\" ",
      "155. Let us now turn our eyes to the United States of America. Following the continuous dis- sentions and resentments of the of the inhabitants of the colonies in the North American Continent because of imposition of new taxes and stricter trade laws, the Continental Congress appointed a Committee on June 12, 1776, to prepare a draft for the declaration of Independence. On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopted ushering the birth of a new nation. At that time George II] was the King og England and Lord North was the Prime Minister. The War of Independence continued for nearly six years. Ultimately with the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis on October 19, 1781, the war ended and the Treaty acknowledging the independence and sovereignty of the thirteen colonies was signed in 1783.In the meantime, the Articles of Confedera. tion was ratified by all the States by March 1, 1781, These constituted the Constitution of the United States of America.  ",
      "154. The Navy, however, in the United King- dom, has been free from constitutional problems. The maintenance of Navy has always been within the Royal Prerogative but its terms of enlistment and discipline are regulated by the Acts of Parliament.  ",
      "153. The Parliament, however, since 1955, instead of passing annual Acts, gave the Army and Air Force Acts, a maximum life of five years, sub- ject to annual renewal by the Order in Council, But such Orders in Council are required to be laid in draft before the Parliament and are subject to an affirmative resolution by each House.  ",
      "152. In the United Kingdom both the civil ser- vants and the members of the armed forces hold their office during the pleasure of the Crown, although statutory protection of employment was given to the civil servants but such protection are not extended to the members of the armed forces, they are regulated under the Royal Prerogative.  ",
      "151. Dicey dealt with the conflict of jurisdic 4 tion between the military and a civil Court in this manner at page-302 : : <br> “In all conflicts of jurisdiction between a military and a civil court the authority of the                            civil Courts prevails. Thus, if a soldier is acquit- ted or convicted of an offence by a competent civil court. he cannot be tried for the same offence by a Court martial: but an acquittal or conviction by a court martial say for man- slaughter or robbery, is no plea to an indictment for the same same offence at the Assizes. When a soldier is put on trial on a charge of crime. obedience to superior orders is not of itself a defence. This is a matter which requires explana- tion.  A soldier is bound to obey any lawful order which he receives from his military superior. but a soldier cannot any more than a civilian avoid responsibility for breach of the law by pleading that he broke the law in bona fide obe- dience to the orders (say) of the commander-in- chief. Hence the position of a soldier is in theo- ry and may be in practice a difficult one. He may, as it has been well said, be liable to be shot by a court-martial if he disobeys an order, and to be hanged by a judge and jury if he obeys it. His situation and the line of his duty may be seen by considering how soldiers ought to act in the following cases.  During a riot an officer orders his soldiers to fire upon rioters. The command to fire is jus- tified by the fact that no less energetic course of action would be sufficient to put down the dis- turbance. The soldiers are, under these circum- stances clearly bound from a legal, as well as from a military, point of view to obey the com- mand of their officer. It is a lawful order, and the men who carry it out are performing their duty both as soldiers and as citizen.  An Officer orders his soldiers in a time of political excitement then and there to arrest and shoot without trial a popular leader against whom no crime has been proved, but who is suspected of treasonable designs. In such a case there is (it is conceived) no doubt that the sol- diers who obey, no less than the officer who gives the command, are guilty of murder and liable to be hanged for it when convicted in due course of law. In such an extreme instance as this the duty of soldiers is, even at the risk of disobeying their superior, to obey the law of the land.  An officer orders his men to fire on a crowd w thinks could not be dispersed without the use of firearms, As a matter of fact the amount of force which he wishes to employ is excessive, and order could kept by the mere threat that force would be used, The order, therefore, to fire is not in itself a lawful order, that is, the colonel, or other officer who gives it is not legally justified in giving it, and will him- self'be held criminally responsible for the death of any person killed by the discharge of firearms. What is from a legal point of view the duty of the soldiers ? The matter is one which has never been absolutely decided: the following answer, given by Mr Justice Stephen, is, it may fairly be assumed, as nearly correcta reply as the state of the authorities makes it pos- siblé to provide : <br> “I do not think, however, that the question how far superior orders would justify soldiers or sailors in making an attack upon civilians has ever been brought before the courts of law in such a manner as to be fully considered and determined. Probably upon such an argument it would be found that the order of a military superior would justify his inferiors in executing any orders for giving which they might fairly suppose their superior officer to have good rea- sons. Soldiers might reasonably think that their officer had good grounds for ordering them to fire into a disorderly crowd which to them might not appear to be at that: moment engaged in acts of dangerous violence, but soldiers could’ hardly suppose that their officer could have any good grounds for ordering them to fire a volley down a crowded street when no disturbance’ of any kind was either in. progress or apprehended. The doctrine that a soldier is bound under all                          circumstances whatever to obey his superior officer_would be fatal_to military disicipline itself for it would justify the private in shooting the colonel by the orders of the captain, or in deserting to the enemy on the field of battle on the order of his immediate superior, I think it is not less monstrous to suppose that superior orders would justify a soldier in the massacre of unoffending civilians in time of peace, or in the exercise of inhuman cruelties, such as the slaughter of women and children, during a rebellion. The only line that presents itself to my mind is that a soldier should be protected by orders for which he might reasonably believe his officer to have good grounds. The incon- venience of being subject to two jurisdictions, the sympathies of which are not unlikely to be opposed to each others, is an inevitable conse- quence of the double necessity of preserving on the one hand the supremacy of the law, and on the other the discipline of the army.”  (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "150. The Bill of Rights, 1689, prohibited the maintenance of a standing army by the Crown in peacetime without the consent of Parliament. AV Dicey, in his ‘An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution’ Tenth Edition, 1973, con- sidered the legal position of the army in the United Kingdom in this manner at page-299: <br> “The position of the army, in fact, was determined by an adherence.on the part of the authors of the first Mutiny: Act to the funda- mental principle of English law, that a soldier may, like a clergyman, incur special obligations in_his_official_ character, but is_not_thereby exempted from the ordinary liabilities of citi- zenship,  The object and principles of the first Mutiny Act of 1689 are exactly the same as the object and principles of the Army Act, under which the English army is in substance now governed. A comparison of the two statutes shows at a glance what are the means by which the maintenance of military discipline has been reconciled with the maintenance of freedom, or, to use a more accurate expression, with the supremacy of the law of the land........ ..... \"a person subject to military law,” stands in a two- fold relation: the one is his relation towards his fellow-citizens outside the army; the other is his relation towards the members of the army and especially towards his military superiors any man, in short, subject to military law has duties and rights as a citizen as well as duties and rights as a soldier. His position in each respect is under English Law governed by definite Principles  A soldier’ position as a citizen —The fixed doctrine of English law is that a Soldier though a member of a standing army, is in England subject to all the duties and liabilities of an ordinary citizen. <br> “Nothing in this Act contained” (so runs the first Mutiny Act) “shall extend or be con. strued to exempt “any officer or soldier whatso. ever from the ordinary “process of law”,  These words contain the clue to all our leg. islation with regard to the standing army whilst employed in the United Kingdom. A soldier by | his_contract_of enlistment undertakes many obligations in addition to the duties incumbent upon a civilian. But he does not escape from any of the duties of an ordinary British subject, |  The results of this principle are traceable  throughout the Mutiny Acts.   A soldier is subject to the same criminal  liability as a civilian. He may when in the  British dominions be put on trial before any competent “civil” (i.e. non-military) Court for  any offence for which he would be triable if he  were not subject to military law, and there a certain offences, such as murder, for which he must in general be tried by a civil tribunal.  Thus, if a soldier murders a companion or robs  traveler whilst quartered in England or in Vat Diemen’s Land, his military character will not save him from standing in the dock on thé charge of murder or theft.”  ",

      "148. A thousand years ago, the. King of England used to rule his Kingdom by Divine right. .                           As the fountain of justice, he was the first Magistrate of the Realm and used to run his Kingdom mainly by Royal Decrees and preroga- tives. The King was also the Commander-in-Chief of his army and also the defender of faith. As such, all the main functions of the Kingdom were fused in the Sovereign. The King used to resolve all matters of importance with Curia Regis or the Great Council of the Realm.  ",

      "146. Mr Akhter Imam, Advocate, however, in support of Martial Law, contended that.in our coun- try.a Martial Law culture or Martial Law jurispru- dence has been evolved. He based his argument partly on the book ‘Bangladesh Constitution: Trends And Issues’ by Justice Mustafa Kamal. The learned Advocate, read extensively from the said book and argued that whether we like it or not we can neither avoid nor overlook the long shadows of Marshals. They are there and it is better to acknowledge them.  We have given our utmost consideration to the above submission of Mr Akhter Imam but found no substance. Rather we must acknowl- edge that we no longer live in the era of Henry VIII, Lois XIV or even Napoleon Bonaparte, whose words were law. But we live in the 21st century. Now the voice of the people, however . feeble, is the first as well as the last word. Their will is the supreme law. The Constitution guar- antees it, so also the Court and every body must follow this principle without any exception, in this Twenty First Century.    ",
      "145.  In the instant case, it is alleged that the solemn Change Constitution of Bangladesh were freely changed by the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs, issued by self-appointed or nominated Presi- dents and CMLAs, in their whims and caprices. The learned Additional Attorney-General although did not support Justice Sayem but half-heatedly attempted to justify the actions taken by Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed and Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU psc. but when we specifically asked him to show us any Constitutional or legal provision in justification of the seizure of State—Power of the Republic, he was without any answer although he mumbled from time to time about the Fourth Amendment.

      "144. In the case of Anwar Hossain Chow- dhury etc VS Bangladesh (Popularly known as the Constitution 8th Amendment case) 1989 BLD (Spl) |, Shahabuddin Ahmed J ( as his Lordship then was), held at para-272, page-118: <br> “In this case we are to interpret a Constitu- tion which is referred to, as the will of the peo- ple and supreme law of the land and as such it isa most important instrument. But its pre-emi- nence is not derived only from the fact that it is the supreme law of the land; it is pre-eminent because it contains lofty principles and is based on much higher values of human life. On the one hand, it gives out-lines of the State appara- tus, on the other hand, it enshrines_long cher- ished hopes _and_aspirations of the people: it glves guarantees of fundamental rights of a cit- izen and also makes him aware of his solemn duty to himself, to his fellow citizen and to his country ... (The underlinings are mine) From a reading of the above Judgements, it would show that nobody denied the supremacy of the Constitution, Even the Attorney-General accept- ted the supremacy of the Constitution, and so also the  ",
      "143. Let us now see what our Supreme Court says about the Constitution. As early as in 1973.in the case of AT Mridha vs State 25 DLR 335, Badrul Haider Chowdhury-J (as his Lordship then was) held at para-10 page-344: _ <br>                          \"In order to build up an egalitarian society for which tremendous sacrifice was made by the youth of this country in the national libera- tion movement, the Constitution emphasises for building up society free from exploitation of man by man so that people may find the mean- ing of life. After all, the aim of the Constitution is the aim of human happiness. The Constitu- tion is the supreme law_and all laws are to be tested the touch stone of the Constitution (vide article 7). It is the supreme law because it exists because the Will of the people is reflected in it.  ",
      "142. Even the Supreme Court did not relent in that horrendous situation when the battles were fought everywhere but upheld the Constitution. In the case of ex parte Milligan (1866), Justice Davis, in delivering the opinion of the Court held : \"This nation as experience has proved cannot always remain at peace and has no right to expect that it will always have wise and humane rulers sincerely attached to the princi ples of the Constitution, wicked men, ambitious of pewer with hatred of liberty and contempt of law may fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln; and if this right is con- template. If our fathershad failed to provide for just such a contingency they would have been false to the trust reposed in them. They knew- the history of the world told them—the nation they were founding, be its existence short or long, would be involved in war; how often or how long continued, human foresight could not tell; and that_unlimited power, wherever lodged at_such_a time, was _especiall hazardous to freemen. For this, and other equally weigh rea. sons, they secured the inheritance they had fought to maintain, by incorporating in a written | constitution the safeguards which time had | proved were essential to its preservation. Not one |. of these safeguards can the President, of |. Congress, or the Judiciary disturb, except the one : concerning the writ of habeas corpus.  ..knowing this, they limited the suspen- sion to one great right, and left the rest to remain forever inviolable. But, it is insisted that the safety of the country in time of war demands that this broad claim for martial law} shall be sustained. If this were true, it could be} well said that a country, preserved at the sacri- 5 fice of all the cardinal_principles of liberty, is} not worth the cost of preservation. Happily. itis | not so.”........, (Quoted from Professor John P.} Frank on; Cases And Materials on Constitu tional Law (1952 Revision) at page 263-64) (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "141. Although there was serious controversy all over the country on the issue of slavery but even in such a trying moment, no proclamation declaring Martial Law was made. Instead, their lawfully elect- ed President gave this message to the Congress on July 4, 1861, on the out break of the Civil War : <br> “It presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy—a_government of the people by the same people—can or cannot maintain its terri- torial integrity against its own domestic foes. It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to organic law in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this case or any other pretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence, break up their govern- ment and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth._It forces us to ask: ‘Is there, in all republics, this inherent and fatal weakness ? Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?”  (Quoted from KC Wheare: Modern Constitu- tions, Second Edition, 1966, page-142).  ",
      "140. If we hark back to.the history we would find that the Civil War of 186] in the United States threatened its very existence as one nation. It engulfed the entire country. War went on in almost - every where in the country with bleak prospect for survival — of the States as united with their                           Constitution. Nobody could blame the President of the United States or others in that precarious and catastrophic situation if the Constitution of the country was pushed to the back-seat due to the said extreme emergency but even in that critical situation the citizens of the North upheld the high ideals of democratic principles and did not at all compromise and give in to the inhuman demands of the Southerners, for allowing slavery in the country in violation of the principles of liberty and equality, as enshrined in the Constitution, rather, they held the Constitution high above everything and fought with their lives to free the slaves in vindication of the rights guaranteed under the Constitution.  ",
      "139. Those high ideals are the basis of our nation-hood and the framers of the Constitution had the foresight to apprehend that this country might not always be served by wise consciences and true patriotic persons, rather, might sometimes be gov- emed by ‘wicked men, ambitious of power, with hafted of liberty and contempt of law’ (Justice in ex parte Milligan) who, in their self-interest, may do away with the above noted high ideals of our mar- tyrs, as such, in their wisdom, ‘spelt out those high ideals both in the Preamble and also in Article 8(1) the Constitution So that those fundamental prin- ciples shall remain permanently as the guiding prin- ciples and as the ever lasting light house for our Republic the original Article 8(1) reads as follows: <br> The English version is : <br> “8, (1) The principles of nationalism, social- ism, democracy _and__ secularism, together with the principles derived from them as set out in this Part, shall constitute the fundamental_principles of State policy. <br> (2) The principles set out in this Part shall be fundamental to the governance of Bangladesh, shall be applied by the State in the making of laws, shall be a guide to the interpretation of the Constitution and of the other laws of Bangladesh, and shall form the basis of the work of the State and of its citizens, but shall not be judicially enforce- able.” (The underlinings are mine)  The apprehensions of the framers of the Constitution proved to be right. In 1975, Martial Law was imposed in the country and brick by brick, the various provisions of the Constitution was wrecked by the usurpers. The Second paragraph of the Preamble, the Article 8 and many other Provisions containing the fundamental principles of the Stale Policy was deleted on April 23, 1977, by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamation Order No.1 of 1977), proclaimed by Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU psc, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator of Bangla- desh. ! ",
      "137. In this manner Article 7 declares the supremacy of the Constitution as stated in the fourth paragraph of the Preamble. <br> 138.The second paragraph of the Preamble in the original Constitution, spells out the high ideals of the Republic This paragraph reads as follows: <br> “pledging that the high ideals of national- ism, socialism, democracy and secularism, which inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves to, and our brave martyrs to sacri- fice their lives in, the national liberation strug- gle, shall be the fundamental principles of the Constitution;”  Our Liberation War was fought on these high ideals of nationalism, socialism, democracy and sec-’ iarism. These high ideals inspired our heroic peo- ple to dedicate themselves and our brave martyrs to sacrifice their lives in the national liberation strug- gle.  ",
      "136. Mustafa Kamal J (as his Lordship then was) in Kudrat-e-Elahi.Panir vs Bangladesh 44 DLR (AD) 319, in acknowledging. its importance helo at pera-72, that Article 7(1) says that all powers in the Republic belong to the people. <br>                          ",
      "135. ‘In the case of /989 Anwar Hossain Chowdhury vs Bangladesh BLD (Spl) !, BH Chow- dhury J (as his Lordship then was) analysed Article 7 in this manner at para-52, page-60:  On analysis the Article reveals the follow- ing: <br> (a) All powers in the Republic belong to \"the people. This is the concept of sov- -ereignty of the people. This echoes the words of the proclamation “by the                           mandate given to us by the people of Bangladesh whose will is supreme”. <br> (b) This exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of this Constitution. Limited government with three organ performing designated functions is envisaged. In the Proclamation it was said the President “shall exercise all the Executive and Legislative powers of the Republic” “till such time as Constitution is framed” and he will “do all other things that may be nec- essary to give to the. people of Bangladesh an orderly and just Government. Hence separation of Powers emerges as a necessary corol- lary of designated functions; <br> (c) Supreme Law of the Republic. That points to supremacy of the Constitu- tion because; <br> (d) Any law is void to the extent of incon- sistency with the Supreme Law (i.e. the Constitution) which therefore con- templates judiciary; <br> (e) Supreme Court with plenary judicial power for maintenance of the supre- macy of the Constitution”. <br> His Lordship further held at para-149-150, page-84 : <br> “149.Our Article 7 has reflected the wis- dom of the past and the learning of the history. Therefore, it has said categorically: <br> (1) All powers in the Republic belong to the people—this is a concept of sovereign- ty of the people. Sovereignty lies with the people not with executive, legisla- ture or judiciary—all these three are creations of the Constitution itself. <br> (2) They are exercised on behalf of the peo- ple shall be an effected only, under, and held by the authority of the Constitution This is the concept of limited Gover. ment based on theory of Separation of powers and then Article 7(2)says sig. nificantly that this Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic This is the supreme law not in theory because it says \"if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void”, <br>  150.Law as defined in Article 152 means any Act, ordinance, orders rule and regulations bye-law notification or-other legal instruments and any custom or usage having the forces in law in Bangladesh. Article 7 says that if any law is inconsistent with the Constitution that law shall to the extent of inconsistency be void, When Article 26 says about the inconsistency of any law with the fundamental right to be void, Article 7 operates in the whole jurisdiction to say that any law and that law includes also any amendment of the Constitution itself because Article 142 says that amendment can be made by Act of Parliament. Therefore if any amend- ment which is an Act of Parliament contravenes any express provision of the Constitution that amendment act is liable to'be declared, void, So says Article 7, But by whom this declaration is, to be made? It is the executive which initiates the proposal for law. It is the legislature that passes the law. Then who will consider_the validity or otherwise of the law-obviously the  judiciary.”  His Lordship further approved the contention of  Mr Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, at para-198, page-97, that Article 7 stands like a statue of liberty.  ",
      "134. In the case of Md Shoib vs Government of Bangladesh 27 DLR 315, this concept has been noticed. DC Bhattacharya J held at para-20, p-325 : <br> “In a country run under a written Constitu- tion, the Constitution is the source of all powers of the executive organs, of the State as well as of the other’ organs, the Constitution having manifested the sovereign will of the people. As it.has. been made clear in article 7 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh that the Constitution being ‘the solemn expression of the will of the people. is the Supreme law of the Republic and all powers of the Republic and their exercise shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, the Constitution. This is a basic concept on which the modern states have been built up.” (The underlinings are mine)  This Article 7 is the touch-stone in the con- struction of the Constitution which provides for undoubted supremacy of the Constitution.  ",
      "133. In commensurate with the noble visions spelt out in the preamble, Article 7 proclaims that all powers in the Republic belong to the people of Bangladesh and the Constitution being the solemn expression of their will, is the supreme law of the Republic. Article 7 reads as follows: <br> 7 . (1) All powers in the Republic belong to the  people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of this Constitution.  (2) This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent’ with this ee Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.  Article 7(1) emphatically proclaims that all powers of the Republic belong to the people and their exercise on their behalf shall be effected only under and by the authority of this Constitution. = Article 7(2) is equally significant. It proclaimed that the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Republic being the solemn expression of the will of the people that any other law which is inconsistent with the Constitution that other law shall, to that extent of the inconsistency, be void.  Article 7 is an unique one and is not found in any other Constitution. It emphatically without any ambiguity, declares the supremacy of the Constitution in no uncertain terms.  ",
      "132. The framers of the Constitution kept in mind all these sad saga and the test of fire which the Bangalees went through while liberating their coun- try at the time of framing of the Constitution. They knew. that,a time may come when the black shadow                           of the horrendous past may even make a return in future to engulf the nation all over again in various evil disguises, as such, in their wisdom emphatical- ly spelt out the intentions of the real architects of this Republic in the original Preamble in this man- ner :  The English Text is : <br> PREAMBLE <br> “We, the people of Bangladesh having  proclaimed our Independence on the 26th day of March 1971 and, through a historic struggle for national liberation, established the Indepen. dent, sovereign People’s Republic of Bangla. desh;  Pledging that the high ideals of national. ism, socialism, democracy and Secularism, which inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves to, and our brave martyrs to sacri. fice their lives in, the national liberation strug. gle, shall be the fundamental principles of the Constitution; , :  Further pledging that it shall be a funda- mental aim of the State to realise through the democratic process a socialist society, free from exploitation — a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equali- ty and justice, political, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens;  Affirming that it is our sacred duty to safe- guard, protect and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh so that we may prosper in freedom and may make our full contribution towards international peace. and co-operation in keeping with the. progressive aspirations of mankind;  In our Constituent Assembly, this eigh- teenth day of Kartick 1379 BS, corresponding  to the fourth day of November 1972 AD..do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution,” (The underlinings are mine)  This was the dream of the true architects of this Republic who made supreme sacrifices for its emer gence. This being the intentions of the architects of the Constitution also and that the ‘pole-star in the Construction of a Constitution is the intention of its makers and adopters’ as aptly’ observed by “Ohio Judge in the case of HM Co vs Miller (92) Ohio 5 <br>                           115 . The said observation was also cited with approved by Nuhammad Munir CJ in the Reference by the President of Pakistan PLD 1957 SC 219 (235) 9 DLR (1957) SC 178 (188). So also MH Rahman I in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury’s case, in holding the preamble as part of the Constitution, observed at pura-456 page-173-4: \"456, After referring to the Proclamation of independence on 26th day March, 1971, the war of national independence and the principles of nationalism, democracy and socialism for which our brave martyrs sacrificed their lives the makers of the Constitution in the name of “We, the people” declared the fundamental principles of the Constitution and the funda- mental aims of the State......... If any provision can be called the pole star of the Constitution then it is the Preamble.” (The underlinings are mine)  Part XVII (B) Supremacy of the Constitution  ",
      "131. T his is how Bangladesh was liberated and independence was achieved against unfathomed odds which cannot now even be imagined. As such every one in the Republic, from the highest func- tionary to the lowest, must ingrain in their hearts that the liberation struggle itself is the cornerstone of the Republic of Bangladesh and its Constitution. This was also judicially recognized in the case of the Registrar, University of Dacca vs Dr Syed Sajjad Hussain 34 DLR AD BH Chowdhury J (as his Lordship then was) observed at para-37, page-18:  '..liberation struggle is the corner stone of our constitution, As the preamble begins ‘we, the people of Bangladesh, having proclaimed our independence on the 26th day of March, 1971 and through a historic war for national independence established the inde- pendent, sovereign People’s Republic of Bangladesh. By Proclamations Order No. | of 1977 amendment was made and previous to the amendment it read ‘ a historic struggle for national liberation”. The historic struggle for national liberation is not only eulogized but in optative manner it was raised to the level of “historic war for national independence.” 1971 period was one phase but the struggle continues because fundamental aim of the state is to realisé a society in which the rule of law, fun- damental human rights and freedom, equality and justice and in that view the Constitution has laid down the fundamental principles of state policy”. Though the. preamble to. the Constitution was amended as_ aforesaid, clause(b) of paragraph 5 remained same and any_attempt to redicule or belittle “liberation struggle” _or “creation of Bangladesh” is con- demned' We also join to add that any attempt to truncate any of the fundamental principles and basic features of the Constitution is condemned and deprecated.  ",
      "130. The freedom fighters fought against the mllitarily superior Pakistan army, they also fought against their Bengali vasals and compatriots who fiendishly fought against the liberation of Bangla- desh.They wanted an independent Bangladesh and to get rid of the Pakistan army and their compatriots once for all. Those freedom fighters are the real architects of the Republic of Bangladesh and their ideals must be respected, honoured and be given utmost importance. The framers of the Constitution is framing the constitution tried to visualize. and feel their death agony in bringing Bangladesh into existence through the process of its violent birth.  ",
      "129. The Preamble of our Constitution eulo- gizes the lofty and holy ideals and spirit of the mak- ers of the Constitution. In framing the Constitution they kept in mind those who gave their life and blood for the violent birth of Bangladesh and tried to uphold their ideals of liberation and independence which came about in the path silted with their blood and toil. The independence was not given in a silver platter. It was earned at the cost of many thousands of lives and tears of innumerable mothers and wid- ows. The Freedom Fighters ungrudgingly gave their lives knowing full well that they might never see the liberation of Bangladesh still they made their supreme sacrifice with their last and solemn hope that others may live in an independent country, a country where their own Bangalee nationalism would flourish in a socialistic secular society, emblemed with democratic principles.   ",
      "128. The said speech delivered on November 19, 1863 at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, reads as fol- lows: <br> “Four score and seven ‘years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any: nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.  We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a_ portion of that  field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that the nation might live. It is  altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate  We can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who _struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to_add_or detract. The world will little note. nor long remember what We say here, but it can never forget what they did here, It is for us the living, rather, to be ded- icated here to the unfinished work which they Who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicat                            ed to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that govern ment of the people by the people for the peo ple shall not perish from the earth   ",
      "127. This expression and spirit Ordained in our Constitution has a remarkable similarity to what President Abraham Lincoln said seven SCore years  ago in his famous address at Gettysburg in 1863 that the Government of the United States being a gov. ernment of the people, by the people and for the people would not perish from the earth,  ",
      "126. This is how the people of Bangladesh, through their elected representatives, who formed the Constituent Assembly, approved the Proclama- tion of independence on the 26th March 197] and establishment of Bangladesh. :  The fourth paragraph of the Preamble reads as fol- lows : <br> “Affirming that it is our sacred duty to safeguard, protect and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodi- ment of the will of the people of Bangladesh so that we may Prosper in freedom and may make our full contribution towards international peace and co-operation in keeping with the pro- gressive aspirations of mankind”  This portion of the preamble very clearly without any ambiguity spells out and cast a sacred duty upon the people of Bangladesh to safeguard, Protect and defend its Constitution and also to main- tain its Supremacy. This paragraph projects the doubtless Supremacy of the Constitution and also  the unshakable duty of all persons in Bangladesh uphold it over every Institutions and functionaries it created. The preamble is a part of the Constitution and it in a nutshell declares jts highest Place of importance. Generally, a written constitution, as dis cussed above, being the supreme law, all other laws must conform to it, still in order to Spell out any doubts the preamble of our Constitution highlights the supremacy and paramountcy of the Constitution over all other laws without any exception,   ",
      "125. The first paragraph of the original Preamble of the Constitution of Bangladesh reads as follows : <br> “We, the people of Bangladesh having pro- claimed our independence on the 26th day of March, 1971 and through a historic struggle for national liberation established, the independent, Sovereign People’s Republic of Bangladesh.;”  ",
      "124. His Lordship, however, in his opinion approved the following observations of Shelat and Grover, JJ, in Kesavanada Bharati’ case at para- 453-455, page-173 :  “453..... Shelat and Grover JJ observed in _Kesavanand AIR 1973 SC 1461 . “The Consti- tution makers gave to the preamble the pride of place. It embodied in a solemn form all the ideals and aspirations for which the country had struggled....It is not without significance that the Preamble was passed only after draft arti- cles of the Constitution had been adopted with such modifications as were approved by the Constituent Assembly. The Preamble was, therefore, meant to embody in a very few and well defined words the key to the understanding of the Constitution” ..... <br> 454 . At para 537 of the report the learned Judges said: <br> “The Preamble serves several important purposes. Firstly it indicates the source from | which the Constitution comes viz. the people of India. Next it. contains the enacting clause which brings into force the Constitution. In the third place, it declares the great rights and free- doms which the people of India intended to secure to all citizens and the basic type of gov- ernment and polity which was to be established. From all these, if any provision in the Consti- tution had to be interpreted and. if the expres- sions .used therein. were. ambiguous, the Preamble would certainly furnish. valuable guidance in the matter, particularly when the question is of the correct ambit, scope and width of a power.intended to be conferred by Art: 368\" 6 casi : <br> 455 . At para 539 . of the report the learned Judges referred to Story: “While dealing with the Preamble to the United States Constitution it-was observed by Story (Commentaries on the “Constitution of the United States, 1833 edition,                           Volume J), that the Preamble was not adopted as a mere formulary; but as a solemn at promulgation of a fundamental fact, vital to the character and operations of the Government. Its true office is to expound the nature and extent and applica- tion of the powers actually conferred by the Constitution and not substantially to create them”.  As such, it goes without much ado that the pre- amble to our Constitution depicts in brief the back- ground of our liberation, the basis of our nation- hood, the objectives and duties of the people of Bangladesh in a very precise manner.  ",
      "123. In Anwar Hossain Chowdhury etc. vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD (Spl) 1, MH Rahman J (as his Lordship then was) highlights the importance of Preamble thus: <br> \"443.............. The validity of the impugned amendment may be examined, with or without resorting to the doctrine of basic feature, on the touchstone of the Preamble itself.”  ",
      "122. Sikri CJ, again held at para-121, page- \"121 . It seems to me that the Preamble of our Constitution is of extreme importance and the constitution should be read and interpreted in the light of the grand and noble vision expressed in the Preamble.”  ",
      "121. Holding the preamble as the part of the Constitution, his Lordship held at para-102, page- 1503 : <br> “102 . With respect the Court was wrong in holding as has been shown above, that the Preamble is not a part of the Constitution unless the Court was thinking of the distinction bet- ween the Constitution Statute and the Constitu- tion mentioned by Mr Palkhivala. It was expressly voted to be a part of the Constitu- tion.”   ",
      "120. In kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala AIR 1973 SC 1461, in highlighting the importance of preamble, SM Sikri CJ, held at para “92, page-1501  \"92 I may here trace the history of the shaping of the Preamble because this would show that the Preamble was in conformity with the Constitution as it was finally accepted. Not only was the Constitution framed in the light of the Preamble but the Preamble was ultimately settled in the light of the Constitution.”  ",
      "119. The Craies on. Statute Law, Seventh Edition (1971) explains the object of preamble thus at page-199:   “Preambles, especially in the earlier Acts have been regarded as of great importance as guides to construction. They were to set out the facts or state of the law. for which it was pro- posed to legislate by the statute.”                           Coke was quoted in the said book at page-200: \"The preamble of the statue\" said Coke, is a good means to find out the meaning of the statue and as it were a key to open the under- standing thereof.\"  ",
      "118. In construing the Cinematograph. Act, 1909, Lord Alvrstone CJ observed in respect of pre- amble in the case of London County. Council vs  Bermondsey Bioscope Company Ltd. (1911) IKB  445 at page-451: .  “I quite recognize that the title of an Act is part of the Act, and that it is of importance as  shewing the purview of the Act; and I may express in this connection my regret that the practice of inserting preambles in Acts of Par- liament has been discontinued, as they were often of great assistance to the Courts in con struing the Acts.” (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "117. In considering the Betting Act, 1853, AL Smith LJ, observed in the case of Powell vs Kempton Park Racecourse Company (1897) OB 242 CA at page-271.   '........when I turn to the preamble of the Act which in my opinion must first be read, there is no obscurity as to what the Legislature aimed at when it passed the Act in  question.”  On consideration of the effect of the Preamble his Lordship further held at page-272-3: . <br> “Now what effect has the preamble of an Act of Parliament when the Act has to be con- strued? I do not doubt that, if the words Of the enacting part of an Act of Parliament are clear and unambiguous, they must. be construed according to their ordinary meaning, even  although by so doing the Act is extended beyond what is shewn to be its object by its pre. amble. But the preamble must always play an important part in the construction of a statute, Dyer CJ calls the preamble of a statute “a key to open the minds of the makers of the Act and the mischief which they intended to redress” - Stowel v. Lord Zouch.......... ”  ",
      "116. It also gives the scope of the statute in  Lord Halsbury LC in Income Tax Commis- sioners vs Pemsel (1891) AC 531 approved the observation of Dyer CJ in Stowel vs Lord Zouch, made in respect of preamble that it is a key to open the minds of the makers of the Act (at page-543).  ",
      "114. It may be reiterated that the independ- ence of Bangladesh was declared on the night fol- lowing 25th March, 1971 and independence was achieved on 16th December, 1971 . Within less than one year, the Constitution of Bangladesh, was made on November 4, 1972 . It was definitely a great feat by any standard. na dies <br> Part XVII(A) Preamble of the Constitution , <br> 115... The. Constitution . starts with the Preamble. “Let us first look’at the original Preamble of our Constitution. <br> “The Preamble is divided in five paragraphs. In the first paragraph, it stated how Bangladesh came into being, In the Second paragraph it stated the fun- damental basis of the nation-hood of Bangladesh. In                           the third-paragraph, it spelt out the lofty ideals and the ultimate goal of the state for its citizens. The fourth paragraph affirms that it is the sacred duty of the people of Bangladesh to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution. The fifth paragraph proclaimed the adoption of the Constitution by the people of Bangladesh.  This preamble may be compared with the Magna Carta or the preamble of the Bill of Rights, 1689.  It embodies and proclaimed in emphatical terms our historical war of liberation, our aims, objects, ideals and the ultimate goals in establishing the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.  The preamble sets out the ideological aspira- tions of the people of Bangladesh. The essential fea- tures of the grand concepts spelt out in the Preamble are delineated and studded in various provisions of the Constitution.  This preamble is the key and the silver gate to our sacred Constitution. It is comparable only to the preamble of the Constitution of the United States of America but as a matter of fact its impact is deeper and wider.  In this connection it should be noted that from earlier days preamble in a statute in England was regarded with great importance. It is treated as guides to its construction. It gives an idea about the back-ground purport, objects and subject-matter of the Act in question.  ",
      "113. _ Keeping in view the above noted legal position as discussed above let us now consider the Constitution of Bangladesh. It begins’ with’ the Preamble. zs tora t  ",
      "111. Similar is the Constitutional position in India. It has also a rigid Constitution which is. the supreme law and all other laws and the Institutions must conform to it. <br> Part XVII The Constitution of Bangladesh » <br> 112... We have made -a: detailed. discussions above on the concept of Constitution and its supre- macy because the issues involved in this Rule is with regard to the Constitution of Bangladesh vis-a- vis the Proclamations and its legality or validity.  ",
      "110. On the other hand, the United States of America, has a rigid Constitution, In pursuance to the provisions of this Instrument all three major Institutions came into being. The Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary, all works within the ambit of the Constitution. In the United States, the Constitution is Supreme and all the Institutions are bound by it. Any law made by the Legislature or any action taken by the Executive, in derogation to the Constitution, becomes void to that extent.  ",
      "109. The Indian Supreme Court also recog- nizes the superiority and permanence of the Consti- tuional provisions. In the above noted Golak Nathi’s case Subba Rao CJ held Para-44, Page-1666 :  “There is an essential distinction between Constitution and Statutes. Comparatively speaking. Constitution is permanent: it is an organic_statute; it grows by its own inherent force. The Constitutional concepts are couched in elastic terms. Courts are expected to and indeed should interpret, its terms without doing violence to the language to suit the expanding needs of the society.”  (The underlinings are mine)  The above discussions on the Constitutional positions in the United Kingdom, the United States, and India, show that in the United Kingdom the supremacy of the Parliament at West Minister is firmly established,after a long struggle with the enactment of the Bill of Rights, 1689 . The inde- pendence of judiciary was achieved in the Act of Settlement, 1700 . The laws as passed by the Parlia- ment and interpreted by the judiciary, are of Universal application in the United Kingdom and all are bound by those laws, The Constitutional Conventions, although are not laws but are the main plank and bulwarks of the Constitution of the United Kingdom.  ",
      "108. The judiciary also performs its functions  ‘in defending and upholding the Constitution as is required of them. The Supreme Court of India upheld the supremacy of the Constitution in no uncertain terms in many of its decisions . In the case of Golak Nath vs State of Punjab AIR 1967 SC 1643, K Subba Rao CJ, held at para-15, Page-1655: <br> “The Objective sought to be achieved by the Constitution is declared in sonorous terms in its preamble which reads: <br> “We the people of India have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic and to secure to all its cit- izens justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.”  It contains in a nutshell its ideals and its aspiration. The preamble is not a platitude but the mode of its realisation is worked out in detail in the Constitution. The Constitution brings into existence different Constitutional entities, namely the Union the States and the Union Territories. It creates three major instru- ments of power, namely Legislature, the Executive and Judiciary, Noauthority created under the Constitution is supreme' the                          Constitution is Supreme an all the authorities function under the supreme law of the land. The rule of law under the Constitution has a glorious content. It embodies the modern concept of law evolved over the centuries...It, therefore, pre- serves the natural rights against the State encroachment and constitutes the higher judici- ary of the State as the sentinel of the said rights and the balancing wheel between the rights, subject to social control..\" (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "107. In India, the Constitution was framed in 1949 . Although, it was amended from time to time by the proper authority as enjoined in its constitu- tion but it was neither abrogated nor Suspended by any ‘Supra-Constitutional authority’, No Wonder  democracy in its real spirit has taken sure and pro- nounced roots in India.  ",
      "106. By way of example his Lordship held as follows at page-534-35 : <br> “It is no doubt true that the Constitution was enacted by the President, as stated in the Preamble, in exercise of the Mandate given to  him by the people of Pakistan, But once the Constitution had been enacted, he became under Article 226 (1) read with Article 227 (1) the first President of Pakistan under the Constitution, and, after he had taken the oath of office under the Constitution to act faithfully in accordance with the Constitution and to pre- serve, protect and defend the Constitution his powers became circumscribed by the provi- sions of the Constitution and he could do no more than what the Constitution empowered him to do.  ",
      "105. Upholding the supremacy of the Consti- tution, Hamoodur Rahman J (as his Lordship then was), quoting Cooley, in the case of Fazlur Quader Chowdhury vs Md Abdul Hoque PLD 1963 SC 486 = 18 DLR (SC) 69, held at page-535:  “A Constitution”, says Cooley in his Treatise on Constitutional Limitations is “the fundamental law of a State, containing the prin- ciples upon which the Government is founded, regulating the division of the sovereign powers, and directing to what persons each of these powers is to be confined, and the manner in which it is to be exercised.” The fundamental principle underlying a written Constitution is that it not only specifies the persons or authori- ties in whom the sovereign powers of the State are to be vested but also lays down fundamen- tal rules for the selection or appointment of such persons or authorities and above all fixes the limits of the exercise of those powers. Thus the’ written Constitution is_the source from which all governmental power emanates and it defines its scope and_ambi hat each fune- tionary should act within his respective sphere, NO power can therefore be claimed by any fctionary which is not to be found withint the four corners of the Constitution nor can anyone transgress the limits therein specified,”  (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "104. In. 1962,. its second. Constitution -was framed. This Constitution was also abrogated: in                            1969 . However, following its first general election in 1970, when the army rulers refused to convene the National Assembly, the Bangalees in the erst- while East Pakistan, declared their Independence, leaving the West Pakistan on its own which is now the Pakistan. In 1973, another Constitution was made there. However, the supremacy of the Consti- tution was also upheld by the judiciary in Pakistan from time to time, atleast in theory.  ",
      "103. Pakistan and India became independent in 1947 . Although India framed its Constitution promptly in 1950 but Pakistan has rather a turbulent constitutional history. Its first Constitution was framed in 1956 after much hustle and tussle. But this was abrogated in 2(two) years in 1958 . Martial Law was proclaimed and the armed. forces took upon, themselves the task of saviours of the nation.  ",
      "102. It appears that in this manner a Constitu- tion after its enactment bind every body in the State as the supreme law of the Republic. It binds and reg- ulates not only the Institutions of the State which it creates but also the very: ‘People’ of the Republic. It may, no doubt,.be.amended but only by the special procedure and manner spelt out in the Constitution itself, Besides, such amendment:can only. be made by the proper authority as enjoined-in the Constitu- tion but not by any other person or group of persons how high or powerful or mighty they may appear to be, rather, it is to be, remembered that the Constitu- tion is superior and greater and its shadow is much taller and higher than even any of those mortals.  ",
      "101. It can be recalled what Justice Stanley Mathews emphatically stated more then six score years ago with regard to the sovereignty of the peo- ple in the case of Yick Wo vs Peter Hopkins(1885) 118 US 356 (book 30 Law Ed) (370): <br> “When we consider the nature and the the- ory of our institution of government, the princi- ples upon which they are supposed to rest and review the history of their development, we are constrained to conclude that they do not mean to leave room for the play and action of purely personal and arbitrary power. Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and source of law: but in our system, while sovereign powers are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains _with the people, by whom and_for whom all government exists and acts. And the law is the definition and limitation of power. It is, indeed, quite true, that there must always be lodged somewhere, and in some person. or body the authority of final decision,. and, in many cases of mere administration the responsibility is purely political, no appeal lying except to the ultimate tribunal ‘of the public judgment, exer- cised either in the pressure of opinion or by means of the suffrage. But the fundamental rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi- ness considered as individual possessions are secure maxims of constitutional law which are the moments showing the victorious progress of the race, in securing to men the blessings of civilization under the reign of just and equal laws so that in the famous language of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights, the Government of the Commonwealth \"may be a Government of laws and not of men”, For, the very idea that one man may be compelled to hold his life. or the means of living, or any material right essen- tial to the enjoyment of life, at the mere will of another, seems to be intolerable in any country where freedom prevails, as being the essence of slavery itself.\" In this connection Article 3 . of Fourth French Republic is worth reading on this point. It says:  ‘National sovereignty “belongs to the French people. No section of the people nor any individual may assume its exercise. The people exercise it in constitutional matters by the vote of their representatives and by the referendum. In all other matters they exercise it through their deputies in the National Assembly, elected by universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage.  (Quoted from KC Wheare on ‘Modern Consti- tutions’ at page 62). (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "100. The ultimate superiority of the ‘People’  Was aptly stated by Alexander Hamilton in the  Federalist in this manner: <br> “There is no position which depends on clearer principles than that very act of a dele- gated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void No legislative act, therefore contrary to the constitution can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm than the deputy is greater that his prin cipal that the servant is above his master, that the representatives of the people are superior the people themselves that man acting by                            virtue powers may do not only what their powers do not authorize but what they forbid ......the Constitution ought to be preferred to the Statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.” (Quoted from KC wheare on Modern Constitutions at page 60).  (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "99. The modern republican form of demo cratic government is based on the concept of the rights of the people to govern themselves through their own elected representatives. Those representa: tives are the agents of the people. They govern the country for and on behalf of the people at large. But those very ordinary people are the owners of the  country and their such superiority is recognized in the Constitution.  ",
      "98. Besides, the sovereignty of the State lies with the ‘People’ and the Constitution has been drawn up by the representatives of the people as the embodiment of their will, Since the sovereignty of the nation Hes with its people, so also its will. As such, of necessity, the Constitution is the supreme law of the State as the embodiment of the will of the people, The Government being a mere Agent of the ‘People’, the laws made by it, must conform to the Constitution as agent and trustee for and on behalf of the people, The concept of the Supremacy of the ‘People’ as the supreme law giver has been recog- nized tor the titst time in the United Stated when they ratified their own Constitution in 1787 ang by and by with almost all countries of the World with democratic sprits ingrained in their Constitutions Even in those countries where democracy exists only in form and not in its true spirit, still the rulers govern their countries although in-an autocratic and feudalistic fashion but ironically again in the name of the ‘People’ who has, in fret, no part in the Government but in abusing their name their rulers ‘gover’ instead of ‘serve’ them,  ",
      "97. This logical argument of Chief Justice John Marshall as propounded above is being accept- ed all over the globe because it is the Constitution which establishes the Institutions of the State with limitations upon its functions, as such, those limita- tions must be enforced along with its powers. Those Institutions are Supreme, no doubt, so long those remain within the bounds spelt out in the Constitu- tion. The irresistible conclusion is th cy of the Constitution is inherent in given priority over all other laws.   ",
      "96. In almost all the countries the Constitution is glorified as the supreme law of the country in\"                            contradiction to the other laws enacted by the legislative authorities of the country. This superior position of the Constitution in contradistinction to other enactments passed by the legislatures has been lucidly explained by John Marshall, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, more than two hundred years ago in the case of Marbury VS Madison in 1803 :  “The question, whether an act, repugne to the constitution, can become the law of the land, is a question deeply interesting to the United States; but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. It seems only nec- essary to recognize certain principles, supposed to have been long and well established, to decide it. <br> ................. The Powers of the legislature are defined_and_limited_and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation. Com- mitted to writing, if this limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction between a government with limit and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are imposed, and if acts prohibited and acts allowed, are of equal obligation. _It is a proposi- tion too plain to be contested, that the constitu- tion controls any legislative repugnant to it: or, that the legislature may alter the constitution by an ordinary act. <br> ....Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must be that an act of the legislative repugnant to the constitution is void.  that rule, If two conflict with each other the courts must decide on the operation of each  So if a law be in opposition to the constitu- tion; if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the Court must either decide the case conformably to the law disre garding the constitution or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty.  If then the courts are to regard the constitu- tion; and the constitution is superior to any ordi- nary act of the legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.  Those then who controvert the principle that the constitution is to be considered in Court as a paramount law are reduced to the  necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law.  This doctrine would subvert the very foun- dation of all written constitution. It would declare that an act, which, according to the prin- ciples and theory of our government, is entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely obligatory. It would declare, that if the legislature shall do what is expressly forbidden, such act, notwith- standing the express prohibition, is in reality effectual. It would be giving to the legislature a practical and real omnipotence, with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits, It is prescribing limits and declaring that those limits, may be passed _a pleasure That it thus reduces to nothing what we have deemed the greatest improvement on political institutions-a written constitution- would of itself be sufficient, in America, where written constitutions have been viewed with so much reverence, for rejecting the constitution, But the peculiar expressions of the constitution                            of the United States furnish additional anu- ments in favour of its rejection,  The jndicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the constitu tion Could it be the intention of those who gave this power to say that in using it he constitu tion should not be looked into? That a case aris ing under the constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it arise?

",
      "95. Regarding supremacy of the Constitution and the limitation on its amendment, Professor Wheare stated at page-7. <br> “The nature of the limitation to be imposed on a government, and therefore the degree to which a Constitution will be supreme over a government, depends upon the objects which the framers of the Constitution wish to safe- guard. In the first place they may want to do no more than ensure that the Constitutin wish to safe altered casually or carelessly or by subterfuge or implication; they may want to secure that this important document is not lightly tampered with, but solemnly, with due notice and deliber- ation, consciously amended. In that case it is legitimate to require some special process of constitutional amendment-say that the legisla _ ture may amend the Constitution only by a two: _ thirds majority or after a general election or per haps upon three months’ notice.  ",
      "94. Professor Wheare traced the origin of the Constitution in this manner at page-6 <br> “If we investigate the origins of modern Constitutions, we find that practically without exception, they were drawn up_and_adopted because people wished to make a fresh start, so far as the statement of their system of govern- ment was concerned, The desire or need for a fresh start arose either because, as in the United States, some neighbouring Communities wished to unite together under a new govern- ment; or because, as in Austria or Hungary or Czechoslovakia after 1918, Communities had been released from an Empire as the result of a war and were now free to govern themselves; or because, as in France in 1789 or the USSR in 1917, a revolution had made a break with the past and a new form of government on new principles was desired; or because as in Germany after 1918 or in France in 1875 or in 1946, defeat in war had broken the continuity of government and a fresh start was needed after the war. The circumstances in which a break with the past and the need fora fresh start come almost every case in modern times, countries have a Constitution for the very simple and ele. mentary reason that they wanted, for some reg. son, to begin again and so they put down in writing the main outline, at least, of their pro- posed system of government. This has been the practice certainly since 1787 when the American Constitution was drafted. and as the years passed no doubt imitation and the force of example have led all countries to think it neces- sary to have a Constitution.”  ",
      "92. Professor KC Wheare, in his celebrated book: ‘Modern Constitution’, Second Edition, 1966 at pages-1-5 explains Constitution in this manner:             <br>              The word ‘constitution’ is commonly used in at least two senses in any ordinary discussion of political affairs. First_of all it is used to describe the whole sys f government of a country, the collection of rules which establish and regulate or govern the government.........- ..... What_is_more, this selection is almost invariably a selection of legal rules only. “The Constitution’, then, for most countries in the world, is a selection of the Legal rules which govern the government of that country and which have been embodied in a document.  Perhaps the most famous example of a Constitution in this sense is the Constitution of the United States of America..... The Americans in 1787 declared: ‘We, the people of the United States....... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America Since that time the practice of having a written document containing the principles of govern- mental organization has become well estab- lished and Constitution has come to have this meaning. ...........  What is more, in the United States, if on act of Congress or on act of any state legislature or of any other rule-making authority in the country, conflicts with the terms of the Constitution, it is void.”  ",
      "92. Similar is the position in Bangladesh . It has a Constitution which is controlled and rigid in character. Like the United States, all three great Departments owe its existence to the Constitution. In this Rule we are concerned with the legality of ratification and confirmation of the Proclamations etc. in pursuance of insertion of Paragraph 18 to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution by Section 2 of the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 . As such, we are to consider first, what is a Constitution, its role and impact on the Republic, and then the Parliament, one of the three Institutions, created by the Constitution, and the extent of its power lo amend the said Constitution.  ",
      "91. James Madison in the Federalist Papers embodies 1787-88 explained the above Principle as embodied in the US Constitution in this manner : <br> “The constitution of Massachusetts has observed a sufficient, though less pointed cau- tion, in expressing this fundamental article of liberty. It declares, ‘that the legislative depart- ment shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them: the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them’ This declaration cor- responds precisely with the doctrine of Montes- quieu.......... It goes no farther than to prohib-  - it any one of the entire departments from exer- cising the powers of another department. In the very constitution to which it is prefixed, a par- tial mixture of powers has been admitted vena wsies (Quoted from Peter Woll on ‘American Government’, 1962 at Page-8).  In the United States, its‘Constitution assumed the central position. All three major organs of the State owe its existence to the Constitution and revolve round it. All legislative and executive func- tions must conform to the Constitution, otherwise, the judiciary in exercise of its role as the defender of the Constitution would declare such actions as ultra vires to the Constitution.  ",
      "90. The Republic of the United State is based on constitutional democracy with Separation of Powers. It put the theory of Montesquieu into actual practice, The framers of the Constitution took all possible care that the powers of the Republic is not concentrated in one hand or in one Institution. Although this doctrine was applied in the later part of the 18th century but as a matter of fact Aristotle (384-322 BC) identified the three elements of the State in his famous treatise ‘The Politics’.  ",
      "89. ‘In any State, there are three essential bod- ies namely, the legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The legislature legislates to cater the needs of the society, the executive runs the adminis- tration with the laws made by the leg- islature while the Judiciary upholds the Constitution and the laws of the country and.ensure that the other two great bodies of the State function within the bounds of the Constitution and the laws made there under. It is desirable that there should be a clear demarcation in those three bodies in their respective functions so that none of those bodies can act arbi- trarily, rather, each one of those bodies keeps the other within its legal bounds. This system of checks and balances between the three institutions of the State is the essence of the doctrine of Separation of Powers,  ",
      "88. As a matter of fact the concept of separa- tion of powers as propounded predominantly by Baron Montesquieu was put into actual. practice through the Constitution of the United States: Montesquieu observed in De | Esprit des Los (1748) as follows : <br> “When the legislative and executive pow’ ers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty ... Again, there is no liberty if the power of judging is not separated from the legislative and executive. If it were joined with the legislative                             the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would then be the legislator. If it were joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression. There would be an end to everything, if the same man, or the same bodey, whether of the nobles or the people, were to exercise those three powers, that enact- ing laws that of executing public affairs, and that of trying crimes or Individual causes.”  (Quoted from Hilaire Barnett: (Constitutional and Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, 2002, at page- 106).  ",
      "87. The Constitution, however, does not itself spell out the concept of separation of powers but the relevant Provisions of the Constitution show such separation of powers.  ",
      "86. In contradistinction to United Kingdom with unwritten Constitution, there exists in the United States of America, separation of powers, on the basis of a written Constitution.  ",
      "85. Still the Courts in its anxiety to dispense justice finds ways and means to do exactly what it thinks that the Parliament intends to do. In the lan- guage of HWR Wade at page -418  \"The Courts may presume the Parliamen, when it grants powers, intends them to be exer cised_in_a_ right and proper way. Since Parliament is very unlikely to make provision to the contrary, this allows considerable scone for  the courts to devise _a set of canons of fair  administrative procedure, suitable to the needs of the time”.  (The underlining's are Mine)  (Quoted from HWR Wade: ‘Administrative Law’ Fifth Edition, 1982),    ",
      "84. Again, in the case of RV HM Treasury ex parte Smedley (1985)1 AILE R 589, the challenge                           was with regard to the payment from the Conso- lidated Fund, without express parliamentary approval. Sir John Donaldson MR held : <br>  .....Before considering Mr Smedley”s objections ...... I think that I should say a word about the respective roles of Parliament and the courts. Although the United Kingdom has no written constitution, it_is a constitutional con- vention of the highest importance that the legis- lature and the judicature are separate and inde- mate rights of Parliament over the judicature which are immaterial for present_purposes . It therefore behoves the courts to be over sensitive to the paramount need to refrain from trespass- ing on the province of Parliament or, so far as this can be avoided, even appearing to do so. Although it is not a matter for me, I would hope and expect that Parliament would be similarly sensitive to the need to refrain from trespassin on the province of the courts....... It is the func- tion of Parliament to legislate and legislation is necessarily in written form. It is the function of the courts to construe and interpret that legisla- tion. Putting it in popular language, it_is for Parliament to make the laws and for the courts to tell the nation, including members, of both Houses of Parliament what_those_laws mean...... . At the present moment, there ie ne Order in Council to which Mr Smedley can object as being unauthorized. .,....... In many, and possibly most, circumstances the proper course would undoubtedly be for the courts to invite the applicant to renew his application if and when an order was made, but in some Cir- cumstances an expression of view on questions of law which would arise for decision if Parliament were to approve a draft may be of service not only to the arties, but also to each House_of Parliament itself. This course was adopted in R vs Electricity Comrs, ex P London Electricity Joint Committee Co (1920) Ltd. (1924) KB 171, (1923) All ER Rep 150 In that case an inquiry was in progress, the cost of which would have been wholly wasted, if there after the minister and Parliament had approved the scheme only to be told at that late stage that the scheme was ultra vires (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "83. But inspite of the apparent supremacy of the Parliament there was always an inbuilt limitation inherent in the system itself. Leslie Stephens explains the point : <br> \"..........It is limited, so to speak, both from within and from without; from within, because the legislature is the product of a cer- tain social conditions, and determined by what- ever determines the society: and from without, because the power of imposing laws is depend- ent upon the instinct of subordination, which is itself limited, If a legislature decided _that_all blue_eyed babies should be murdered, the preservation of blue eyed babies would be ille- gal; but legislators must_go mad_before they could pass such_a law, and subjects be idiotic before they could submit to it.”  ( The underlinings are mine)  [Quoted from Hilaire Barnett: Constitu- tional And ‘Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, 2002 Page 196] es  ",
      "82. But the Bill of Rights, 1689, made all the difference. It dispelled all confusions and emphati- cally declared the supremacy of Parliament. Its terms altered the balance of power in favour of the Parliament instead of the Crown. From then on the Courts in England accepted an Act of Parliament as valid. This Act has been followed by the Act of Settlement, 1700 . This among others, provided for the security of tenure for the judiciary during good behaviour. This Act ended the power of the Crown to dismiss the judges at his will. From then on the judges of the Superior Courts could not be removed short of impeachment. This is how the independence of judiciary was achieved three hundred years ago. The judiciary in its turn ensured the supremacy of the Parliament by judicial pronouncements.  ",
      "81. In early 17th century, the supremacy of the Parliament was not even achieved. At that peri- od of time both the Parliament and the Judiciary was fighting against the supremacy of the divine right of the King to rule his subjects and also with his pre- rogatives which Were sought to be expanded during the reign of James I and Charles I with the active support of many a jurist of that age. Besides, the Star Chamber Was there. The said Court was infamous for extracting Confessions by torture, sometimes at the behest of the Crown. At that time Judges used to serve at the pleasure of the Kings and often they used to be dismissed as Coke CJ, himself was dis- missed in 1617.  ",
      "80. On the concept of law and the Constitu- tion Sir Ivor Jennings, in his treatise ‘Cabinet Government third Edition, 1969, expressed the real sentiment of the English people at page-1-2 : <br> \",.With us, ‘the law’ is not an emana- tion from authorities set up or provided for by a written and formal document. It consists of the legislation of Parliament and the rules extracted fom the decisions of judicial authorities. The powers of these bodies and the relations between them are the product of history. The constitutional authorities have claimed_and have exercised law-making functions and the people has acquiesced in their exercise. Revolu- tion has helped to determine constitutional powers; but no revolution has produced a per- manent written constitution. It has produced, instead, the recognition of a rule that Parliament can legislate _as_ it pleases and that what Parliament enacts is law. ..........  Neither the Cabinet nor the office of Prime Minister was established by legislation, nor has either been recognized by the courts of law   These persons are under no legal obliga-  tion to obey, but they do obey. There is a whole complex of rules outside ‘the law’,.........s+e+0 They are called by various names, but are now commonly referred to as ‘constitutional con- Ventions”. (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "79. In those assemblies germane was the principle of democracy which was taking root in England though very slowly but surely, more seven hundred years ago. The principle of democra- cy was no doubt in a crude form but it started to bloom and the people of England themselves was the centre piece. There the people brought the revo- lutionary ideas of Hobbs, Locks into actual practice                            in the national politics It is they who protected their rights and liberty against all onslaughts from time immemorial.  ",
      "78. This great assembly, however did not form a single body but each of the three bodies dis- cussed and voted separately. They also made pro- portional grants in favour of the King. The grat assemblies of 1275 and 1295 in the fullness of time became the modern English Parliament which is the model for parliamentary system of Government of many a countires all over the globe  ",
      "77. The history of this omnipotent Parlia ment dates back to nearly one thousand years; Long before the Norman conquest in 1066, there Used. to be the meetings of the ‘wise’. These meetings per formed the functions of the Teutonic national assembly bly known as Witenagemot. After the Norman con- quest, the meeting of the wise was replaced by the Curia Regis. From time to time, the feudal great councils was attended not only by the tenants-in chief but also the under-tenants on SUMMONS from ‘ the King. In April, 1275, Edward I summoned his  first general parliament at Westminister and the  Statute of Westminister was executed. In the 23rd year of his reign in 1295, Edward I was in serious difficulties. There was rebellion of the Welsh, war with Scotland was continuing, the French fleet reached the English Coast and landed at Dover _ Under this critical condition, the King felt that he require the support of the entire nation by way of their common counsel and adequate grant of an aid. He accordingly summoned a Parliament to meet at Westminister in November, 1295 . This was for the first time the national parliament was attended by ‘ the barons and knights, the burgesses and the clergy.  ",
      "76. Professor AV Dicey, in his celebrated treatise ‘Introduction To The Study Of The Law Of The Constitution’ (Tenth Edition, 1959), views  Parliamentary Sovereignty in this manner at pages 39-40 : <br> “The sovereignty of Parliament is (from a legal point of view) the dominant characteristic of our political institutions  The principle of Parliamentary sovereignty means neither more nor less than this, namely, that_Parliament_thus defined has, under the English constitution, the tight_to make _or unmake any law whatever: and, further, that no person or body is recognized by the law of  England as having a right to override or set side the legislation of Parliament.”   (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "75. Parliament has been established by Article 65 of the Constitution. The legislative pow- ers of the Republic has been vested in this body which is acclaimed as the House of the Nation in the Constitution. But before we discuss about the legal  concept of our Parliament, let us look at the British Parliament first.  ",
      "74. Before we enter into discussions on the vires of the Fifth Amendment validating the Martial Law Proclamations and many others, let us first con- sider the legislative powers of the Parliament.  ",
      "73. Yaqub Ali J himself explained why he had to explore so much of abstract jurisprudence in his Judgment, at page 235 : <br> “I have burdened this order with different theories of law not only for the purpose of find- ing out the essential qualities of law, but also  because during the last thirteen years or more we have so much gone astray from the rule of law_that_not only the common man, but_the lawyers and Judges alike need to refresh their minds about the true import and form of law.”  And then his Lordship gave his own view on law : <br> “The preponderant view appears to be that law is not the will of a sovereign. Law is a body of principles called-rules_ or norms-recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice as rules recognized and acted upon by the Courts of justice. It must have the contents and form of law. It should contain one or more elements on which the different theories of law are based, and give expression to the will of the people whose conduct and behaviour the law. is going to regulate. The will of the people_is nowadays often expressed through the medium of Legislature comprising of the chosen repre- sentatives of the people. The will of a single man howsoever laudable or sordid is a behest or a command, but is certainly not law as under- stood in juristic sense.” : <br> \"2 . (The underlinings are mine)  I also quoted extensively from various books on Jurisprudence in order to explore the wide horizon of law to understand the concept of 'No Law' because even after advent of so much of civilization and philosophy, we still confuse ourselves between what is law and what is the dearth of law so much so that very often the supreme law of the land is being pushed out and obliterated by some shadow                           which does not even come within the definition of ‘law’ as defined in our Constitution.  Although ‘Law’ was not defined in the 1962 Constitution of Pakistan but our Constitution defines law as follows : <br> ““law’ means any Act, Ordinance, Order, Rule, Regulation, Bye-law, Notification or other legal instrument, and any custom or usage, having the force of law in Bangladesh.”  It is apparent that ‘law’ as defined in Article 152 of the Constitution of Bangladesh, does not include  Proclamations or Martial Law Regulations or Martial Law Orders.  Part XV The Parliament-—Historical Growth  ",
      "72. We-quote some of the observation of Yaqub Ali J as follows;  “In introduction to ‘Law in the Making\"» CK Allen mentions two antithetic Conceptions  of growth of law: (i) law is which is imposed by, a sovereign will; and (ii) law which develops within society of its own vitality. He Criticizes Austin who defined “law” as the will of the sov-. ereign and points out that whatever be the con. stitutional instrument which secures observance and enforcement of law—and some sanction of this kind is certainly indispensable—there is no historical justification for the view that this power always and necessarily be a determinate, “human superior” which at the same time cre- ates all law. It is impossible in every form of society governed by law to disengage and per- sonify a “sovereign” as thus understood, with | the artificial precision which Hobbs and Austin assume.......... Dugit’s definition is as follows:  “Men live together in groups and societies; | they are dependent upon, solidarist with, one another. They have common needs which they can satisfy only by a common life: and, at the same time, they have different needs the satis: faction of which they assure by the exchange of reciprocal services, The progress of humanity is assured by the continuous growth, in both directions, of individual_activity. Man, so placed in society, has the obligation to realize this progress, because in so doing he realizes himself.  From the imminent force of things, there fore, there arises a‘rule of conduct which we may postulate as a rule of law.”                           Roscoe Pound states that more than one reason led American realists which define law in terms of judicial process. One is the central position of the Court in the Anglo-American legal system and the concrete character of a legal percept in that system as a product of the courts rather than of the universities. Again, economic determinism and psychological real- ism lead to scrutiny of the work of individual Judges, and skeptical relativism leads to dis- counting of norms and rules and authoritative guides to determination. Certainly the judicial process (to which today we must add the administrative process) is something of which a theory of the subject-matter of jurisprudence must take account.........   In “A_Grammar of Politics” Laski_adds : “To those for whom law is a simple command, legal by virtue of the source from which it comes, it is not likely that such complexities as these will be popular, We are urging that law is, in truth, not the will of the State, but that from which the will of the State derives whatever moral_authority it may possess.....It assumes that the rationale of obedience is.in all the intri- cate facts of social organization and in no one group of facts. It denies at once the sovereignty of the State, and that more subtle doctrine by Which the State is at once the master and the servant of law by willing to limit itself to cer- ° tain tested rules of conduct. It insists that what is important in law is not the fact of command, but the end at which that command aims and the way It achieves the end. It sees society, not as.a pyramid in which the State sits crowned upon the \"Summit, but_as_a system of _co-operatin interests through which, and in which, the indi- vidual finds his scheme of values. It argues that each individual scheme so found gives’ to the “law whatever, of moral rightness it contains. and any other view is seeking to invest coer- cive authority with ethical content on grounds which analysis shows to be simply the fact of the power to coerce, That power may how its way to success, but it does not, by the fact of the  victory, become a moral agent. We argue, rather, that our rules of conduct are justified only as what they are in working induces our allegiance to them.”  ",
      "71. ‘In referring to Jurisprudence, his Lord- ship further held : <br> “The thesis of Dias is thus the same as that now adopted by the learned counsel; namely, that “the legality of the law-constitutive medi- um only comes about when the Courts accept, or are made to accept it.”  In the above noted case, Yaqub Ali J also con- sidered what the law is in order to determine   whether the Martial Law Orders, Martial Law Regulations, Presidential Orders and Ordinances by General Yahya Khan, may be recognized by the Courts. It should be noted in this connection that law was not defined in the Constitution of Pakistan of 1962 s. Yaqub Ali J traveled, the world of  Jurisprudence to find the real face of ‘law’   ",
      "70. In the case of Asma Jilani vs Government of the Punjab PLD 1972 SC 139, a question of nature, scope and content of law was raised on behalf of one of the appellants. Hamoodur Rahman, CJ dealt with the question in this manner at p-159:  “The task of a Judge in the circumstances, is not an easy one. But is it necessary for him to define law ? Law itself is not a legal concept, for, what is law is really a theoretical. question. Conclusions of law do not depend upon the def- inition of law nor are legal judgments based on definitions of law and, in fact, as Sir Iver Jennings has said in his Article on the Institu- tional Theory published in Modern Theories of Law, Oxford University Press, 1933 (page 83) “the task which many writers on jurisprudence attempt to fulfill in defining law is a futile one”, for, according to him, “law has no definition except in a particular context.”  So far as a Judge is concerned, if a defini- tion is necessary, all that he has to see is that the law which he is called upon to administer is made by a person or authority legally compe- tent to make laws and the law is capable _ of being enforced by the legal machinery. This, in my view, brings in the notion both of legitima- cy and efficacy.  ",
      "69. Under the American Realism, the view of O.W. Holmes is as follows:  “Take the fundamental question, What con- stitutes the law? You will find some text writers telling you that it is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason, that it is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions. But if we “take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws for the axioms or deductions, but that he does want to know what the Massachusetts or England courts                           are likely to do in fact I am much of his mind The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact and nothing more pretentious are what I mean by the law\" (The underlinings are mine)  (Quoted from Lloyd’s Introduction to Jurisprudence at page-670).  ",
      "68. In his book ‘The Concept of Law’ pofessor HL A.Hart, treated the pathology of Legal gystem in this way : P-117 to 118:  “Evidence for the existence of a legal sys- tem must therefore be drawn from two different sectors of social life. The normal, unproblemat- ic case where we can say confidently that a legal system exists, is just one where it is clear that the two-sectors are congruent in their respective typical concerns with the law. Crudely put, the facts are, that the rules recog- nized as valid at the official level are generally obeyed. Sometimes, however, the official sector may be detached from the private sector, in the sense that there is no longer general obedience to the rules which are valid according to the cri- teria of validity in use in the courts. The variety of ways in which this may happen belongs to the pathology of legal systems: for they repre- sent a breakdown in the complex congruent practice Which is referred to when we make the external statement of fact that a legal system exists. There is here a partial failure of what is ar ts Whenever, from within the partic- ular, Such a bes make internal statements of law. Such a breakdown may be the product of different disturbing factors. ‘Revolution,’ where rival claims to govern are made from within the group, is only one case. and though this will always involve the breach of some of the laws of the existing system. it may entail only the legally unauthorized substitution of a new set of individulas as officials. and not a new constitu- tion of legal system, Enemy occupation, where a rival claim to govern without authority under the existing system comes from without, is another case; and the simple breakdown of ordered legal control in the face of anarchy or banditry without political pretensions to govern is yet another.  In each of these cases there may be half- way stages during which the courts function, either on the territory or in exile, and still use  the criteria of legal validity of the old once firmly established system; but these orders are ineffective in the territory. The stage at which it  is right to say in such cases that the legal system has finally ceased to exist is a thing not suscep- tible of any exact determination. Plainly, if  there is some considerable chance of a restora- tion or if the disturbance of the established sys- tem is an incident in a general war of which the issue is still uncertain, no unqualified assertion that it has ceased to exist would be warranted.. This is so just because the statement that a legal system exists is of a sufficiently broad and gen- eral type to allow for interruptions; it is not ver- ified or falsified by what happens in short spaces of time.” — (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "67. Earlier, Sir John Salmond in his “Treatise on Jurisprudence’ (7th Edition, 1924) app” the concept of ‘law’ thus: <br>                          'All law he argued, is not made by the leg- .islature. In England much of it is made by the law courts. But all law, however made is rec ognized and administered by the courts and no rules are recognized and administered by the courts which are not rules of laws. It is therefore to the courts and not to the legislature that we must go in order to ascetain the true nature of the law. Accordingly he defined law as the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice, as the rules recognized and acted on by courts of jus tice. ” (The underlinings are mine)  (Quoted from Salmond on Jurisprudence, twelfth Edition, 1966, page-36).  ",
      "66. Professor George Whitecross Paton after considering works of a number of authorities since ancient Greek philosophers approached the concept } of ‘law’ in this manner : <br> “Law may shortly be described in terms of a legal order tacitly or formally accepted ’by a community. It consists of the body of rules  which are seen to operate as binding rules in that community, backed by some mechanism accepted by the community by means of which sufficient compliance with the rules may be  secured to enable the system or set of rules to continue to be seen as binding in nature.  (Quoted from GW Paton on ‘A text book of Jurisprudence’, Fourth Edition 1972 at P-7\"\"  ",
      "65. Thurman Arnold in his article The Symbols of government’ (1935) observed :  “Obviously, ‘law’ can never be defined, With equal obviousness, however, it Should be said that the adherents of the legal institution | must never give up the struggle to define law, | because it is an essential part of the ideal that it | is rational and capable of definition... Hence the verbal expenditure necessary in the upkeep of the ideal of ‘law’ is colossal and never end: | ing. The legal scientist is compelled by the cli. mate of opinion in which he finds himself o  ",
      "64. As such, before we consider What Martial Law means, we would try to understand the concept of ‘law’ first.  ",
      "63. It may be mentioned here that this new nation plunged into a disaster and a constitutional crisis when in the early morning of August 15, 1975, the President of Bangladesh with his family mem- bers were brutally killed by a section of army offi- cers and Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed in conspira- cy with them seized the office of the President of Bangladesh. Bangladesh was tuled by Martial Law Proclamations for nearly the next 4(four) years. The said whole period of Martial Law was sought to be validated firstly by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977) and   secondly by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act No. 1 of 1979),    ",
      "62. Now going back to the genesis of our Constitutional history. After independence, the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh was created by the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh Order, 1972 (PO No. 22 of 1972), on March 22, 1972 . The said Constituent Assembly consisted of the elected representatives of this country, elected both in the National Assembly and also in the Provincial Assembly in the elections held in December, 1970 and in January, 1971, in the erstwhile East Pakistan. This Constituent Assembly completed its task in a remarkably short period of time and framed the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh on November 4, 1972 . The Constitution commenced on and from December 16, 1972 . Having thus ful- filled its functions as the Constituent Assembly, on the commencement of the Constitution it stood dis- solved. This was recorded at paragraph | of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution,  ",

When we're-live this proud moment of our Nation-hood, we cannot but help thinking with Charles Dickens: __ <br> “It was the best of times __<br> It is the worst of times. <br> It was the age of wisdom . <br> It was the age of foolishness _ <br> It was the epoch of belief jee <br> It was the epoch of incredulity <br> Tt was the spring of hope Se oe, Tee It'was the winter of despair”<br> (abridged). fo -o-We have narrated the earlier history leading to the liberation of Bangladesh but not without a pur-. pose. Because, it is always true that ‘a page of his- tory is worth a volume of logic’ (Justice Holmes). We only wanted to highlight the long history of our struggle for independence from the British yoke and thereafter our frustration for such discrimination under the naked domination of the West Pakistani Rulers. We wanted to impress how our self-respect was trampled and insulted in every turn, leading us to our struggle for autonomy which was transformed into a War of Liberation.    "

      "640. Now let us test the constitutionality of the Constitution (fifth amendment) Act, 1979 . This amendment Act sought to legalise the following among others : <br> (i) The seizure of office of President of Bangladesh by Khondaker Moshta- que Ahmed on August 15, 1975. <br> (ii) Change of Article 48, 55 and 142 of the constitution by Khondaker  Moshtaque Ahmed. <br> (iii) proclamation of Martial Law <br> (iv)Made the Constitution subordinate and subservient to the Proclamation of Martial Law. <br> (v) Ousted the jurisdiction of Court including the Supreme court <br> (vi)Nomination of Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem as President of Bangladesh on November 6, 1975 <br> (vii)Proclamation issued on November 8, 1975, and assumption of the powers of Chief Martial Law Administrator, <br> (viii) Dissolution of the National Assembly <br> (ix) Omission of the Bangladesh Colla- borators (Special Tribunal) Order, 1972,       <br> (x) Deletion of proviso to Article 38 of the Constitution, <br> (xi) Deletion of the amendments made by the Fourth Amendment of the Consti- tution, save and except the provisions in respect of the office of the President, the control and discipline of Subordinate Courts and also Article 116A. <br> (xii)Proclamation dated November, 1976, appointing Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc, the Chief of Army Staff, as the Chief Martial Law Administrator, <br> (xiii) Various Proclamation Orders, Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders <br> (xiv) Nomination of Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc., as the President of Bangladesh by an Order dated April 21, 1977. <br> (xv)Change of the Preamble and Article 6, &, 9, 10, 11, 25, 42, 93 and 142 of the Constitution and addition of Article 92A therein. <br> (xvi) Paragraph 3A to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, legalising all Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the actions taken thereon, which were kept out side the jurisdiction of the Court, <br> (xvii) The Referendum Order, 1977 (Martial Law Order No. | of 1977) dated May 1, 1977 and various other Proclamations, MLRs, MLOs etc. including Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 and the actions taken thereon, till the lifting of the Martial Law on April 7, 1979.  The election of the Second Parliament was con- ducted in February, 1979, during Martial Law. At that time, Lieutenant General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc., was the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator. <br> The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, was passed on April 6, 1979, legalizing all the Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations, Martial Law Orders and the actions taken thereon, some of which are mentioned above. <br> Any common man of ordinary prudence would say that the enormity of illegality sought to be legal- ized by this Act, would have shocked the Chief Justice Coke so much so that it would have left him dumb instead of saying that ‘when an Act of Parliament is against right and reason, or repugnant .......................... the common law will control it and adjudge that Act to be void’. <br> Perhaps, it would also leave the Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, out of his comprehension, if he would found that ‘after a formal written Constitution has been lawfully adopted by a compe- tent body and has been generally accepted by the people including the judiciary as the Constitution of the country’, an army commander can have the audacity to change the Constitution beyond recogni- tion and transfiguring a secular Bangladesh into a theocratic State. <br> Perhaps the US Supreme Court would have kept mum instead of holding that the guarantee of due process bars Congress from enactments that ‘shock the sense of fair play’.  But what duty is cast upon us, It is ordained that we must not keep our eyes shut, rather, we are bound by our oath that we must see and appreciate the facts and the law in its proper perceptive.   ",
      "639. Coming back to Bangladesh, Mustafa  Kamal, CJ was emphatic in respect of the independ-  ence of Judiciary in Secretary, Ministry of Finance  vs Masdar Hossain 2000 BLT (AD) 234 where his  Lordship held at para 44, page-257-8 : <br> “44 . ..................The independence of the  judiciary, as affirmed and declared by Articles  94(4) and 116A, is one of the basic pillars of the  Constitution and cannot be demolished, whit-: tled down, curtailed or diminished in any man- ner whatsoever, except under the existing pro- visions of the Constitution. It is true that this independence, as emphasised by the learned  Attorney-General, is subject to the provisions  of the Constitution, but we find no provision in the Constitution which curtails, diminishes or  otherwise abridges this independence. ..... <br> His Lordship further held at para-60, pages-  263-4: “60....... When Parliament and the  executive instead of implementing the provi- sions of Chapter II of Part VI follow a different course not sanctioned by the Constitution, the higher Judiciary is within its jurisdiction to bring back the Parliament and the executive from constitutional derailment and give neces- sary directions to follow the constitutional course. This exercise was made by this Court in the case of Kudrat-e-Elahi panir vs Bangla- desh, 44 DLR(AD) 319 . We don't see why the High Court Division or this Court cannot repeat that exercise when a constitutional deviation is  detected and when there is a constitutional man- date to implement certain provisions of the Constitution.\" (The underlinings are mine) <br> Latifur Rahman J (as his Lordship hen was) also held so at para 76 page 271 <br> \"76 . The written Constitution of Bangladesh has placed the Supreme Court in the place of the guardian of the Constitution itself. It will not countenance to any inroad upon the Constitution. A referencee to Articles 94, 95, 96, and 147 of the Constitution clearly reveal the independent character of the  Supreme Court.\" (The underlinings are mine)   ",
      "638. His Lordship then considers the powers of the Court in respect of the Constitutional measure at page-71 : <br> “I for my part cannot conceive of a situa tion, in which, afler a formal written Constitution has been lawfully adopted i A competent body and has been generally accept- ed by the people including the judiciary as the Constitution of the country, the judiciary can claim to declare any of its provisions ultra vires or void. This will be no part of its function of interpretation. Therefore, in my view, however solemn or sacrosanct a document. if it is not incorporated in the Constitution or does not form a part thereof it cannot control the Constitution. At any rate, the Courts created under the Constitution will not have the power to_declare_any_ provision of the constitution itself. as being in violation of such a document, If in fact that document contains the expression of the will of the vast majority of the people, then the remedy for correcting such a violation will lie with the people and not with the judici- ary ........ if it appears only as a preamble to the Constitution, then it will serve the same purpose as any other preamble serves, namely, that in the case of any doubt as to the intent of the law-maker, it may be looked at to ascertain the true intent, but it cannot control the substantive provisions thereof. This does not, however, mean that the validity of no Constitutional measure can be tested in the Courts. ‘if a constitutional measure is adopted in a manner different to that prescribed in the constitution itself or is passed by a lesser num- ber_of votes than those_specified in the Constitution then the validity of such a measure may well be questioned and adjudicated wpov. This, however, will be possible only in the case of a Constitutional amendment but generally                 not in the case of a first or a new Constitution, unless the powers of the Constitution-making date to  body itself are limited by some supra-Constitu-  tional document.” (The underlinings are mine)  We do not have any doubts about the correct-  ness of the Constitutional position so lucidly  explained above although stated in the back-ground  of the Interim Constitution of Pakistan, 1972, but it  is true, in general, of any written Constitution.  ",
      "637. His Lordship further explains the nature of the power of the Court at page-70 : <br> “In exercising this power, the judiciary claims no supremacy over other organs of the Government but acts only as the administrator of the public will. Even when it declares a leg- islative measure unconstitutional and void, it does not do so, because, the judicial power is superior in degree or dignity to the legislative power, but because the Constitution has vested it with the power to declare what the law is in the cases which come before it. It thus merely enforces the Constitution as a paramount law whenever a legislative enactment comes into conflict with it because, it is its duty to see that the Constitution prevails. It is only when the Legislature fails to keep within its own Constitutional limits, the judiciary steps in to enforce compliance with the Constitution, This is no doubt a delicate task as pointed out in the case of Fazlul Quader Chowdhury vs Shah Nawaz, which has to be performed with great circumspection but it has nevertheless to be per- formed as a sacred Constitutional duty when other State functionaries disregard the limita- tions imposed upon them or claim to exercise power which the people have been careful to whithold from them.\"  ",
      "636. Hamoodur Rahman, C) explains the legal position thus in Sate vs Zie-ur Rahman PLD 1973 SC 29 ar page 69: <br> “This is a right which it acquires not de hors the Constitution but by virtue of the fact that it is a superior Court set up by the Consti- tution itself. It is not necessary for this purpose to invoke any divine or super-natural right but this judicial power is inherent in the Court itself. It flows from the fact that it is a constitutional court and it can only be taken away by abolishing the court itself.\"  ",
      "635. It is true that like the Supreme Courts in the United States or in India, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has got the power of review of both leg- islative and executive actions but such power of review would not place the Supreme Court with any higher position to those of the other two Branches of the Republic. The Supreme Court is the creation of the Constitution just like the Legislature and the Executive. But the Constitution endowed the Supreme Court with such power of judicial review and since the Judges of the Supreme Court have taken oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, they are obliged and duty bound to                declare and strike down any provision of law which is Inconsistent with the Constitution without any fear or favour to any body, This includes the power to declare any provision seeking to oust the jurisdic ton of the Court, as ultra vires to the Constitution.  ",
      "634. This is how the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary functions under the Constitutional scheme in Bangladesh. The Constitution is the undoubted source of all powers and functions of all three grand Departments of the Republic, just like the United States and India.  ",
      "633. In this part of the world we generally fol- low the common law principles but Bangladesh has got a written Constitution. This Constitution may be termed as controlled or rigid but incontradistinction to a Federal form of Government, as in the United States, it has a Parliamentary form of Government within limits set by the Constitution. Like the United States, its three grand Departments, ‘the Legislature makes, the Executive executes and judiciary con- strues the law’ (Chief Justice Marshall), constituting a trichotomy of power in the Republic under the Constitution. But the Bangladesh Parliament lacks the omnipotence of the British Parliament while the President is not the executive head like the US President but the Prime Minister is, like British Prime Minister, However, all the functionaries of the Republic owe their existence, powers and functions to the Constitution. ‘We the people of Bangladesh’, gave themselves this Constitution which is con- ceived of as a fundamental or an organic or a Supreme Law rising lofty high above all other laws in the country and Article 7(2) expressly spelt out that any law which is inconsistent with this Constitution, to that extent of the inconsistency, is void. As such, the provisions of the Constitution is the basis on which the vires of all other existing laws and those passed by the Legislature as well as the actions of the Executive, are to be judged by the Supreme Court, under its power of judicial review. This power of judicial review of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is, similar to those in the United States and in India.  ",
      "632. Since Marbury vs Madison (1803), the US Supreme Court went a long way in expounding the Constitution, a vigorous taproot, in the language of Woodraw Wilson, into a vast constitutional sys- tem. The process how the American Constitutional system has been developed can be understood from the oft quoted observation of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, as observed by Lord Denning : <br> “The rule in the United States is not con- tained in their Constitution itself. It is a judge- made rule. It was stated by Chief Justice Marshall in 1803 in the Marbury case. Later on Charles Evans Hughes, the tenth Chief Justice, in 1908 firmly declared : <br> ‘We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is and the judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty and our property under the Constitution.’ <br> Their Constitution nowhere provides that it shall be what the judges say it is. Yet it has become the most fundamental and far reaching principle of American constitutional Jaw.” (Quoted from Lord Denning : ‘What Next In The Law’ at page-318 of First Indian Reprint, 1993).  ",
      "241. He further says, “what is necessary is to have Judges who are prepared to fashion new tools, forge new methods, innovate new strategies and evolve a new jurisprudence, who are judicial states- men with a social vision and a creative faculty and who have, above all, a deep sense of commitment to the Constitution with a activist approach and obliga- tion for accountability, not to any party in power nor to the opposition ..........0...00.0e. We need Judges who are alive to the socio-economic realities of Indian life, who are anxious to wipe every tear from every eye, who have faith in the constitutional val- ues and who are ready to use law as an instrument for achieving the constitutional objectives (at page 179). He quoted the eloquent words of Justice Krishna lyer ; <br> “Independence of the judiciary is not genv- flexion; nor is it Opposition to every proposition of Government, It is neither judiciary made to Opposition measure nor Government’s pleas- ure”,        <br>         There is no hesitation in saying that these are the words of wisdom handed down to us by the generations of Judges who very politely and meekly from the beginning of the civilisation Reminded the monarch that the King is not above the law but under the law. Some of them were beheaded, imprisoned or destroyed but the cherished theme ran like a refrain throughout the pages of the history.”  ",
      "631. About the judiciary and its independence, BH Chowdhury, J, further observed, quoting Bhagwati, J and Justice Krishna Iyer, at para- 240- 241, page-105 :  <br> “240 . This point may now be considered. Independence of judiciary is not an abstract conception. Bhagwati, J, said “if there is one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it is the judici- ary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the Jaw and thereby making the rule of law a mean- ingful and effective’. He said that the Judges must uphold the core principle of the rule of law which says, “Be you ever so high, the law is above you”. This is the principle of independ- ence of the judiciary which is vital for the estab- lishment of real participatory democracy, main- tenance of the rule of law as a dynamic concept and delivery of social justice to the vulnerable sections of the Community. It is this principle of independence of the judiciary which must be kept in mind while interpreting the relevant pro- visions of the Constitution (SP Gupta vs President of India and others AIR 1982 SC at page 152).  ",
      "630. When King said that he thought the law was founded on reasons and that he and others had reasons as well as Judges, Coke answered : <br> True it was that God has endowed his Majesty with excellent science and great endowments of nature, but his Majesty was not learned in the law of his realm in England, and causes which concemed the life or inheritance or good or fortune of his subject, are not to be decided by natural reasons, but by the artificial reasons and judgment of the law, which law is an act which requires long study and experi- ence, before that 2 man can attain the cog- nizance of it, and the law was the golden metawand one and measure to try the causes of the subject and which protect his Majesty in safety and peace”. <br> The moral is here in the following words: . <br> “The greatest of all the means .......... for ensuring the stability of Constitution-but which is now a days generally neglected is the educa- tion of citizens in the spirit of the Constitution  ................. To live by the rule of the Constitution ought not to be regarded as slavery, but rather as salvation.” (Aniistotle’s Politics (335-322 BC) pp 233-34”  ",
      "629. It may be recalled that a thousand years ago, the King of England, as a fountain of justice, was the first Magistrate of his Realm but by and by his judicial functions were taken over by his judges. In this connection a historical episode was narrated by BH Chowdhury, J, (as his Lordship then was) in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury’ case at para-253, page-108 (BLD) :               <br>  “253 . This judgment will be incomplete if a historical episode is not mentioned, Sir Coke was summoned by King James first to answer why the King could not himself decide cases which has to go before his own Court of justice. Sir Coke asserted: <br> “No King after the conquest assumed him- self to give any judgment in any cause whatso- ever which concerned the administration of jus- tice within the realm but these are solely deter- mined in the court of justice.”  ",
      "628. It is the people of Bangladesh, who pro- claimed that ‘We, the people of Bangladesh’, deemed that there shall be a Supreme Court for Bangladesh, that is why this Supreme Court came into being out of Article 94 of the Constitution, with all the attributes of such a High Tribunal as in exis- tence in the civilised world.  ",
      "627. Now back to Bangladesh. Under the Constitution of Bangladesh, all the powers and func- tions of the Republic are vested in the three grand Branches, namely, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. All these Branches, however, owe their existence to the Constitution since it is the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh.  ",
      "626. Hamoodur Rahman, CJ in dealing with Martial Law provision in Asma Jilani’s case held at page -202 : <br> “However, as this question has been raised, regarding the validity of Martial Law Regu- lation No. 78, I must point out that it follows from what I have said earlier that it was made by an authority whose legal competence we have not been able to recognise on the ground of want of legal authority and the unconstitu- tional manner of arrogation of pwer.\" <br> His Lordship further held at page-204 : <br> “Reverting now to the question of the legality of the Presidential Order No, 3 of 1969 and the Martial Law Regulation No. 78 of 1971 it follows from the reasons given earlier that they were both made by an incompetent authot- ity and therefore lacked the attribute of legiti- macy which is one of the essential characteris- tics of a valid law. The Presidential Onder No.3 of 1969 was also invalid on two additional grounds, namely, that it was a Presidential Order, which could not in terms of the Provi- sional Constitution Order itself amend the Constitution so as to take away the jurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts under Article 98 and that it certainly could not, in any event, take away the judicial power of the Courts to hear and determine questions pertainingeven to their own jurisdiction and this power could not be vested in another authority as long as the Courts continued to exist.\" <br> Yaqub Ali, J, also held in the same vein at p -237 : <br> “As both President's Order No. 3 of 1969 and Martial Law Regulation 78 were intended to deny to the Courts the performance of their judicial functions an object opposed to the con- cept of law, Neither would be recognized by Courts as law,” <br> The moral is clear. If any provision sought to oust the Jurisdiction of Court, that provision itself is not law.  ",
      "625. It may be noted that it is not for the aggrieved persons to plead law but for the Judges to apply the correct provisions of the Constitution and the laws made thereunder and if necessary under the circumstances, is entitled either to uphold any par- ticular statute or to declare it invalid being contra- dictory to the Constitution so long the Government gets adequate opportunity to support the offending provision if so advised. This is the position in the United States, so also in India and there is no reason why it should be otherwise in Bangladesh.  ",
      "624. Justice Robert H Jackson held the same view as will be apparent from his Godkin Lecture, quoted above: <br> “ .............. thus it comes about that in a pri- vate litigation the Court may decide a question of power that will be_of great moment to the nation or toa State,”  This was also indicated by AR Cornelius, CJ in Fazlul Quader Chowdhury vs Muhammad Abdul Haque PLD 1963 SC 486, at page-503:            <br>    “The duty of interpreting the Constitution is, in a fact a duty of enforcing the provisions of the Constitution in_any particular case brought before the Courts in the form of litifation..\" As such it is apparent that the Court may con- sider the constitutionality of any provision in course of a litigation brought before it, it does not have to be a public interest litigation to do so,  ",
      "623. The Supreme Court of India even treated mere letters of an aggrieved person as a petition — under Article 32 and dispensed justice in accordance with law. The Supreme Court of Pakistan, in one occasion, on receipt of a telegram from the Amnesty International, stayed public hangings on finding those as violative of human dignity.  ",
      "622. In that detention case, the High Court held that they had no jurisdiction to enquire into the matter because of an ouster clause in The Jurisdiction of Courts (Removal of Doubts) Order, 1969 (President’s Order No. 3 of 1969). In that premises, this is how Hamoodur Rahman, C J, dealt with the controversy in Asma Jilani s Case in setting her father, Malik Ghulam Jilani, free, at page-197- 199 ; <br> “This provision, as very appropriately pointed out by Mr Brohi, strikes at the very root of the judicial power of the Court to hear and determine a matter, even though it may relate to its own jurisdiction. The Courts undoubtedly                have the power to hear and determine any mat- ter or controversy which is brought before them, even if it be to decide whether they have the jurisdiction to determine such a matter or not. The superior Courts are, as is now W ell set- tled, the Judges of their own jurisdiction. This is a right which has consistently been claimed by this and other Courts of superior jurisdiction in all civilised countries .. .(Page-197)  Learned Attorney-General does not seri- ously dispute the correctness of the contention that “judicial power” is different from “jurisdic tion” * and so faras judicial power is concemed it must exist in courts as long as the courts are there. In fact, he has been bold enough, and I admire him for his boldness, in characterising these provisions of the Presidential Order No. 3 of 1969, which seek to take away the judicial power itself as “absurdities”. He frankly con- power itself as absurdities. He frankly con- cedes that the Courts have and must have the power to determine all questions of their own jurisdiction. It is a proposition so well-settled that no one can challenge it. <br> The learned Attorney-General has, howev- er, sought to contend that where there is a writ- ten Constitution the Courts are themselves crea- tures of the Constitution and have only such jurisdictions as the Constitution chooses to con- fer upon them. I have no cavil with this propo- sition, as I have myself is several cases indicat- ed that the constitution can confer or restrict the jurisdiction of even superior courts but this is not the same thing as saying that it can also restrict or curtail the judicial pwer because that in effect would be denying to the court the very function for which it exists. i.e. to decide a controversy even if it relates to its own jurisdic- tion. <br> In the view that I have taken of the President Order No. 3 1969 that it is a sub- constitutional legislation I cannot but hold that it could not have curtailed the jurisdiction that was given to the High Courts and to this Court by the Constitution of 1962, for, that jurisdic- tion was preserved even by the Provisional Constitution Order. <br> Looking at the matter, therefore, from any point of view, whether, from the strictly legal and constitutional side, or on the basis of the Principle of implied authority as suggested by Mr Manzoor Qadir, or even in terms of the so-called legal order purported to be created by the Provisional Constitution Order of 1969 itself, I cannot escape the conclusion that the Presidential Order No, 3 was an unconstitutional document. General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan according to me no authority to pass such legislation taking away the powers of the courts in his capacity as president under the provisional constitution order. The Martial Law introduced by him was illegal and therefore, even as Chief Martial Law Administrator he was not competent to_validly pass _such laws, and it certainly was in excess of the implied authority, if any, given to him by the letter of Field Marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan dated the 24th of March 1969.  The High Courts were, therefore, wrong in thinking that they had no jurisdiction to enquire into this matter.”  ",
      "621. O Hood Phillips’ in his ‘Constitutional and Administrative Law’, Seventh Edition (1987), explains the mechanism at page-8: <br> \" ......... federal courts have juris- diction to declare provisions of state constitu- lions, state legislation and federal legislation repugnant to the Federal Constitution. It is not Strictly accurate to say that the Courts declare legislation void: when cases are brought before them judicially, they may declare that_an alleged right or power does not exist or that an alleged wrong has been committed because a certain statue relied on is unconstitutional.”  (The underlinings are mine)  Similarly, the case of Asma Jilani etc vs Government of Punjab PLD 1972 SC 139, arose out of habeas corpus petitions for detention of the detenue under Martial Law Regulation 78 of 1971. The Supreme Court of Pakistan not only declared the orders of detention illegal but went further and also held both Presidential Order No. 3 of 1969 and the Martial Law Regulation No. 78 of 1971, as invalid.  ",
      "620. It will be interesting to note that Marbury was not at all interested in the supremacy of the Constitution or the Supreme Court’s power of judi- cial review. He only made a request for mandamus upon Madison, the Secretary of State, directing him to deliver his commission which was ready in all respect but could not be delivered to him earlier due to paucity of time, But the Supreme Court in course of considering his grievance, very consciously declared invalid an Act of the Congress. This is how the US Supreme Court wields its power of Judicial review of legislative actions.  ",
      "618. Normally, the matter would have been ended there but Chief Justice Marshall did not stop there, It was not necessary but he digged further, although, Marbury was only interested in his own commission and not in the least in the vires of the relevant clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789, but Marshall CJ, on examination of the relevant provi- sions found that a contradiction did in fact exist between the Constitution and the pertinent provision of the aforesaid Act.  Robert K Carr tried to visualize the mind-set of a great Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in its infancy in this manner : <br> “In other words, Marshall was invoking that power for the first time at just such a moment when the Fathers probably intended it should be exercised. Jefferson had become  president and his party had won control of Congress. The opposition had obtained com- plete control of the political branches of the government. Is_it_not obvious that_from_the point of view of the Founding Fathers and the Federalist party the time had come to point out that the Constitution as a higher law did place restraints upon congress at the Supreme court as guardian of the constitution had power to enforce those restraints?  In Marbury vs Madison we see Chief Justice Marshall suggesting that the Supreme Court was duty-bound as _a__matter of unescapable__principle to enforce __the constitution as as ol of restraint upon con-                gressional authority through the exercise of its power of Judicial review, ......., * (Quoted from Robert K. Carr on ‘The Supreme Court’ and Judicial Review\" at page-71), (The underlinings are mine)  This is how the review was made two hundred years ago in Marbury vs Madison:  \"If an act of the legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void does it notwithstand- ing its invalidity bind the courts and oblige them to give it effect? or in other words though it be not law does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law?   It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.   The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution.  Could it be the intention of those who gave this power, to say that in using it the constitu- tion should not be looked into? That a case aris- ing under the constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it rises?  This is too extravagant to be maintained. .... Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void: and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by_that_ instrument.” (Quoted from Professor  Noet T. Dowling on the ‘Cases on Constitutional Law Fifth Edition, 1954, at pages-95-97),  ",
      "617. The Court found: that the Constitution limited the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court only In two types of cases, namely, the cases affecting the ambassadors and those in which a State shall be a party but in all other cases the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, not original, As such, the request of Marbury for mandamus was denied,  ",
      "616. John Marshall was a Federalist, He actively participated in the American War of Independence. He was appointed as the Chief Justice of the US Federal Supreme Court by President Adams In early 1801,  ",
      "615. Marbury was one of the ‘midnight judges’, appointed at the last-minute of the tenure of President Adams. The President, however, had acted within constitutional statute and all the appoint- ments were confirmed by the Senate, But unfortu- nately for Marbury, Thomas Jefferson, the new President, took office on March 4, 1801, before his commission could be delivered to him. It was there- after never delivered presumably on the direction of the new President.  ",
      "614. In Marbury vs Madison (1803), William Marbury under a provision of the Judiciary, Act of 1789, prayed to the Supreme Court for issuing a writ of mandamus, compelling James Madison, the Secretary of State, to deliver him his commission for | his appointment as justice of the peace.  ",
      "613. In the United States, the Supreme Court in the last years of the 18th century, started to exer- cise its power of judicial review in deciding the con- stitutionality of Federal and State laws. In Hylton VU S(1796) and in Calder vs Bull (1798), the Court, however, after consideration, upheld the legislation.  ",
      "612. At that time, however, the Bill of Rights, 1689, declaring the supremacy of the Parliament was not enacted. But Chief Justice Holt in the City of London vs Wood (1701) also subscribed to the views of Chief Justice Coke in 1701 also.  ",
      "611. In ultimate analysis it would appear that it is the people which is the source of power of the Court because ‘We the people of the United States’ dreamt that they would have a Court which would be independent of both Congress and the Executive and cannot be brow-beaten by any. The people believe that inspite of all its short-comings, the Supreme Court is still the most trustworthy and at the same time dispassionate custodian of their nghts and liberties guaranteed under their own Constitution. That is why the famous Presidents like Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, inspite of their visible irritation towards many Rulings of the Supreme Court, dared not curb any of its constitu- tional prerogatives. There lies the real supremacy of the Supreme Court and although ‘scarcely any polit- ical question arises in the United States that is not resolved sooner or later into a judicial question’ (Alexis de Tocqueville, 1848). The Supreme Court neither approves nor condemns any legislative poli- cy, it declares whether the legislation is in accor- dance with or in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution, It is ‘the living voice of the Constitution’ (Bryce).  Now on the question of judicial review.  Chief Justice Coke in Dr Bonham’ Case (1610) went so far as to declare that the Court can even declare an Act of Parliament void.  Chief Justice Coke said : <br> “When an Act of Parliament is against right and reason, OF repugnant, OF impossible to be                performed, the common law will control it and adjudge that Act to be void.\" (Quoted from Lond Denning in ‘What Next In The Law\" page: 319),  His such views was supported by Hobart CJ, another contemporary Chief Justice, He held in Day vs Savage (1614), “... even an Act of Parliament made against natural equity, as to make a man judge in his own cause, is void in itself, for jura natural sunt immutabilia and they are leges legumes.\"(Quoted from Administrative Law by HWR Wade, Fifth Edition, 1982 at page-418).  ",
      "610. Alexander Hamilton in his Federalist 78 (1787-1788) examined the judiciary department of the proposed government thus :  “The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution, I under- stand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attain- der, no ex post facto laws, and the like.  Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of the courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void, Without this, all the reser- vations of particular rights or privileges would amount to NOTHING. ....... No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the constitution can be valid to deny this would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal: that the servant is above his mas!e6 that the representatives of the people are sups rior to the people themselves; that men, acting                by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.  It is far more Rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It must therefore belong to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; in other words, the constitution ought to _be pre- ferred to the statue the intention of the people to the intention their agents. ......... ” ( Quoted from Pater Woll on ‘American Government’, 1962) (The underlinings are mine).(page-265- 266).  It is apparent that the framers of the Constitu- tion envisioned that the Supreme Court shall exer- cise its power of judicial review.  The authority of the Supreme Court, in the lan- guage of Justice Robert H Jackson was, in his pro- posed Godkin lecture at Harvard in 1954, which he could never deliver on the topic ‘The Supreme Court as a Unit of Government’: <br> “What authority does the Court possess which generates this influence? The answer is its power to hold unconstitutional and judicial- ly unenforceable an act of the President of Congress or of a constituent state of the Federation. That power is not expressly granted or hinted at in the Article defining judicial power, but _res on logical implication. It is an incident of jurisdiction to determine what really is the law governing a particular case or contro- versy. In the hierarchy of legal values, if the higher law of the Constitution prohibits what the lower law of the legislative attempts, the latter is a nullity' otherwise, the Constitution would exist only at the option of Congress Thus it comes about that in a private litigation the Court may decide a question of power that will be of great moment to the nation or to a state,” (Quoted from the draft lecture notes of Justice Robert H. Jackson of US Supreme Court, published by Harvard University Press, 1955, at page-22) (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "609. The Supreme Court of the United States wields its powers from this Article of the Consti- tution. In pursuance of the powers ordained in this provision, the Supreme Court is charged with the delicate task of declaring the constitutionality not only of the administrative actions of the Executive but also of the laws enacted by the Legislatures. That was the intention of the founding fathers of the said great Republic. Such intentions can be gathered from the Federalist Papers also.   ",
      "608. The United States of America is the first Republic which appears to have accepted the doc- trine of separation of powers in the first three Articles of its Constitution.  Article III begins with the statement ‘The judi- cial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish’. Section 2 states that the judicial power shall extend to all cases, in Jaw and equity, arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United State.  ",
      "607. These three distinct branches of the Republic commensurate with the Doctrine of the Separation of Powers propounded by Baron Montesquieu. In his De | ‘Esprit des Lois (1748), he stressed the importance of the independence of <br> Judiciary : <br> “When the legislative and executive pow- ers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be_no_liber- ty...Again, there is no liberty if the power of judging is not separated from the legislative and executive. If it were joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would then be the legislator. If it were joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression. There would be an end to everything. if the same man or the same body, whether of the nobles or the people, were to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing public affairs, and that of trying crimes or individual causes,” (The underlings are mine)  (Quoted from Hilaire Barnett on Constitutional and Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, 2002). (page-106)  ",
      "605. We have already found that those Proclamations etc. were issued in complete viola- tion of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, notably, Articles 7, 21, 31 and 142 :  Article 7 : <br> (1) All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution, <br> (2) This Constitution is, as the solem\" expression of the will of the people                the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void. <br> Article 21: <br> (1) Itis the duty of every citizen to observe the Constitution and the laws, to main- tain discipline, to perform public duties and to protect public property. <br> (2) Every person in the service of the Republic has a duty to strive at all times to serve the people. <br> Article 31: <br> To enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being within Bangladesh, and in particular no action detri- mental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law.  But by the Proclamations etc, the Martial Law Authorities, specially Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc, changed the basic feature and structure of the Constitution so much so that secular Bangladesh had been deformed into a theocratic State.  We have already found that the Constitution which is the supreme Jaw of Bangladesh, was made subordinate and subservient to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs, by the Martial Law Authorities, which had no legal basis thereby betrayed and insulted the entire population of Bangladesh with its three million martyrs.  We have also found that Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc, had no authority or jurisdiction either to declare Martial Law in Bangladesh or to govern Bangladesh by such Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. We have further found that rule by Martial Law is a negation of liberty and independence for which nearly three million Bangalees laid down their lives.  Paragraph 18 to the Fourth Schedule, was thrust into the Constitution by the Fifth Amendment, sought to legalise all those arbitrary and illegal Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. As such, the Court is not only entitled but it is imperative on its part to break open the veil of enactment and to bring those Proclamations etc. to open which the said amendments illegally sought to ratify, confirm and validate and which would certainly ‘shock the sense of fair play’ of any reasonable person.  We have also noticed the last limb of Para -18 to the Fourth Schedule : <br> “18 . All Proclamations -made during the period between the 15th August, 1975, and the 9th April, 1979............ ..................all orders made, acts and things done,.......be called in question in or before any Court tribunal or authority on any ground whatsoever.  This kind of ouster of jurisdiction clause is negation of fair play, and devoid of confidence on the part of the dictators and almost always is employed to shun away from the scrutiny of a Court of law. This is what we term as the breach of the principle of rule of law.  Thus, in enacting the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, a colourable legislation, a fraud was committed upon the people of Bangladesh,  This is the worst case of violation of rule of law known to us, comparable possibly only to the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1986 . As such, we are of the opinion, that the Parliament had no rational basis in enacting the Fifth Amendment, in violation of the various provisions of the Constitution, notably, the Third Paragraph of the Preamble and Articles 7, 21 and 31, and also 142,               <br> Part XXX Role of the Supreme Court and Its Power of Judicial Review <br> We have noticed above that Paragraph 18 to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution sought to oust the jurisdiction of the Court.  Article 55(2) of the Constitution of Bangladesh vests the executive power of the Republic on the Prime Minister while under Article 65(1), the leg- islative powers are vested on the Parliament which is the House of the Nation. Similarly, Article 94(1) provides for the establishment of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Article 114 provides for the subordi- nate courts.  ",
      "604. This contention, however, is literally true that the Fifth Amendment itself did not create any new law but section 2 added new paragraph, name- ly, Paragraph 18, to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution. This provision ratified, confirmed and validated all Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the actions taken thereon thereby sought to hide a black period of our Constitutional history because those Proclamations etc. literally uprooted the Constitution, not merely changed it.  ",
      "603. It may be reiterated that it was contended on behalf of the respondents that the Fifth Amendment itself, did neither make any new provi- sion nor changed any basic feature of the Constitution, that it merely ratified, confirmed and validated Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs, MLOs etc, and only the actions taken thereon.  ",
      "602. In Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case MH Rahman, J considered rule of law on the touchstone of the preamble at para -443 : <br> \"443 . In this case we are concerned with only one basic feature, the rule of law, marked out as one of the fundamental aims of our soci. cty in the Preamble : The validity of the impugned amendment may be examined, with or without resorting to the doctrine of basic fea- ture, on the touchstone of the Preamble itself.”  In view of our discussions made above, let us now examine how far Constitution (Fifth Amend- ment) Act, 1979, adhrered to the principles of rule of law, as solemnly and lofty enshrined in the Third Paragraph of the Preamble of the Constitution of Bangladesh.  ",
      "601. Hilaire Barnett in the Constitutional and Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, (2002) drew her conclusion thus : at page-103 :  “The law is not autonomous but rest on the support of those it governs. The law is the ser- vant of the sense of rightness in the community, and whilst the rule of law places law above every individual irrespective of rank and sta- tion- it remains, paradoxically, subject _to_the ultimate judgment of the people.”  ",
      "600. In Bachan Singh vs Punjab AIR 1982 SC 1325, Bhagwati, J expounded the heart of rule of Jaw in this manner at pages 1336-1337 : <br> \"10..... it is clear that the rule of law permeates the entire fabric of the Constitution                and indeed forms one of its basic features. The rule of law excludes arbitrariness; its postulate is ‘intelligence without passion’ and ‘reason freed from desire’. Wherever we find arbitrari- Ness or unreasonableness there is denial of the rule of law. That is why Aristotle preferred a government of laws rather than of men. ‘Law’, in the content of the rule of law, does not mean any law enacted by the legislative authority, howsoever, arbitrary or despotic it may be. Otherwise, even under a dictatorship it would be possible to say that there is rule of law, because every law made by the dictator, howso- ever, arbitrary and unreasonable has to be obeyed and every action has to be taken in con- formity with such law. In. such a case too even where the political set up is dictorical. it is law that governs the relationship between men and men and between me e State. But still it is not rule of law as understood in modern jurisprudence, because in jurisprudential terms the law itself in such a case being an emanation from the absolute will of t dictator it is in effect and substance the rule of man and not of law which prevails in such a situation. What is a necessary element of the rule of law is that the law must not be arbitrary or irrational and it must satisfy the test of reason and the demo- cratic form of policy seeks to ensure this ele- ment by making the framers of the law account-  able to the people. ............ ”  ",
      "599. Mathew, J in Smit Indira Nehru Gandhi’ case explained the concept of rule of law in this manner : <br> “338 . The rule of law postulates the per- suasiveness of the spirit of law throughout the whole _range_of Government_in_ the sense_of excluding arbitrary official action _in_any sphere. ‘Rule of Law’ is an expression to give reality to something which is not readily expressible, That is why Sir Ivor Jennings said that it is an unruly horse. Rule of Law is based upon the liberty o individual and has as its object, the harmonizing of the opposing notions of individual liberty and public order, The notion of justice maintains the balance between the two; and justice has a variable content.”  ",
      "598. Next we shall consider the case of Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi vs Raj Narain AIR 1975 SC 2299 . In that case, the appellant was declared elect- ed to Lok Sabha in March, 1971 . This was chal- lenged by the respondent in an election petition in the High Court. The High Court declared the elec- tion void. During the pendency of her appeal before the Supreme Court, Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975, was made, making various changes including insertion of Article 329A. It was argued, inter alia, before the Supreme Court that the election of the appellant would not be void since in view of clause 4 of Article 329A, no law relating to the election petitions made before the aforesaid amendment, would be applicable to the election of the appellant to the Lok Sabha, Khanna, J, held :  \"205 .................... Rule of law postulates that the decisions should be made by the application of known principles and rules and in general such decisions should be predictable and the citizen should know where he is. If a decision is taken without any principle or without any rule, it is not predictable and such decision is the antithesis of a decision taken in accordance with the rule of law. <br> 206 . The matter can also be looked at from another angle. The effect of impugned clause (4) is to take away both the right and the reme- dy to challenge the election of the appellant. Such extinguishment of the right and remedy to challenge the validity of the election, in my opinion, is on with the process of free and fair elections.\"  ",
      "597. In this connection the US Supreme Court held that the guarantee of due process bars Congress from enactments that ‘shock the sense of fair play.’ (Bowen vs Gilliard 483 US 587 = 97L Ed 2d 485(1987), (Quoted from American Jurisprudence, Second Edition, Vol 16B. Para -893, Page-469).  ",
      "596. The American version of the rule of law was contained in the Fifth Amendment of Federal Constitution. This amendment was proposed by Madison and was ratified in 1791 along with nine other amendments which together are known as the ‘Bill of Rights’. The said Fifth Amendment reads as follows :              <br>  “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in case arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a wit- ness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, Without just compensation.”  This is a charter for liberty, equality and frater- nity for the citizen of the United States. The people of the other countries may feel envious for this amendment alone. This embodies a constitutional limitation or check on the powers of the Govern- ment that no person should be deprived of life, lib- erty or property except by due process of law, This amendment guarantees the right to be free and to obtain judicial relief for any illegal violation of such rights. Jt is the deprivation of right or interest with- out due process of Jaw, is unconstitutional which was set right by this amendment.  ",
      "595. In Ashby vs White (1703), White, the Tory mayor and other returning officers refused to accept the vote of Ashby, a whig in the election for Aylesburg. The plaintiff’s action for damages failed in the King’s Bench. But the dissenting views of Holt. CJ, which was upheld by the House of Lords, was as follows :  “if the plaintiff has a right, he must of necessity have a means to vindicate and main- tain it, and a remedy if he is injured in the exer- cise or enjoyment of it, and indeed it is a vain thing to imagine a right without a remedy; for want of right and want of remedy are recipro- cal.”(Quoted from ‘Administrative Law By HWR Wade, Fifth Edition, 1982 at page-670).  But long before that when Hazrat Umar Farooq (RA), was elected as the Caliph in 633 AD, he not only appointed Qadis for every district but issued the following instructions :  “Praise to God.  Verily Justice is an important obligation to God and man. You have been charged with this responsibility. Discharge the responsibility so that you may win the approbation of God and the goodwill of the people.  Treat the people equally in your presence, in your company, and in your decisions, so that the weak despair not of justice, and the high- placed have no hope of your favour.  The onus of proof lies on the plaintiff. He who denies must do so on oath. Compromise is permissible, provided _it does not turn the unlawful into lawful, and the lawful into unlaw- ful. ...” (Quoted from Prof. Masud-ul- Hasan on ‘Hadrat Umar Farooq’, Second Edition, 2001, at page-167-8).  This shows that the spirit of Rule of Law was present so long ago in Arabian Peninsula on the advent of Islam.  ",
      "594. At about this time, Moghal Emperor Jahangir, after his ascension to the throne in 1605, hung a great golden chain with sixty bells in his palace so that any man of however humble calling, could pull it in order to draw his attention, so that the Emperor could readily redress his grievance and grant relief to his sufferings. The purpose was obvi- ously to see that even handed justice is dispensed with.  ",
      "593. James I, on coming to the English throne, initially tried to assert his divine right to be the King but on the remonstrance of the Commons, Lord Salisbury reported to the House of Lords that the King had acknowledged that, although he derived his title from his ancestors, “yet the law did set the crown upon his head,” “and that he was a king by the common law of the land.” (1610) (Quoted from English Constitutional History By Thomas Pitt Taswell-Langmead, Tenth Edition, 1946, Page-384 n.p.).  ",
      "592. Earlier, during the reign of Edward III, men were. arbitrarily imprisoned without legal                  process, as such, in those early years of the Parlia- ment in England in enacting a provision in 1354, debarring such arbitrary action, used the words ‘due process of law’: <br> “that no man, of what estate or condition that he be, should be put out of his lands or ten- ements, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disherit- ed, nor put to death, without being brought to answer by due process of law:” (Quoted from Select Documents of English Constitutional History, 1910, Edited by George Burton Adams and H. Morse Stephens, from clause IV of The Petition of Right, at page-340).  (The underlinings are mine)  This provision was enacted long before the enactment of the Fifth Amendment of the US Federal Constitution in 1791.  ",
      "591. This English principle of rule of law or the American concept of ‘due process of law’ was first found place in the Magna Carta. The Great Charter of the Barons was accepted by the King John of England in June 15, 1215 at Runnymede. Clause 39 and 40 are : <br> “39 . No free man shall be taken or impris- oned or disseised or outlawed or exiled or in any way ruined, nor will we go or send against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land. <br> 40 . To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay right or justice.” (Quoted from 1215 The year of Magna Carta by Danny Danziger & John Gillingham, 2003).  In the Thirteenth Century, Henry de Bracton was a Judge during the reign of King Henry HI, He had the courage to write in his Treatise : <br> “Quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, Sed Sub Deo et Lege” (That the King should not be under man, but under God and the law).  At that time and thereafter on the divine right to rule asserted by the Kings of England, Bracton was quoted time and again to the their annoyance who took it not only as an affront but as a treason spe- cially by the Stuart King James I.   ",
      "590. But the obligation to obey law was shown long ago in 399 BC by Socrates. We learn from the writings of Plato that Anytus and Meletus and other democratic leaders of Athens charged Socrates that he was an atheist because he believed in one God instead of many and that he was corrupting the minds of youths of Athens who were his pupils. The crowd of Athens decreed that he should drink the hemlock. His friends offered him an easy escape but he refused, rather, accepted the verdict in obedience to the law of Athens although he knew that he was not wrong, but preferred death than giving up his right to free thought.  ",
      "589. But Stanley de Smith viewed the ideas of cracy. His notion of rule of  \".......... One can at least say that the concept is usually intended to imply (i) that the powers exercised by politicians and officials must have a legitimate foundation; they must be based on authority conferred by law; and (i) that the law should conform to certain mint- mum standards of justice, both substantive and procedural.” (Quoted from the Constitutional And Administrative Law by Stanley de Smith and Rodney Brazier, Eighth Edition at page-  17)..  ",
      "588. AV Dicey in his ‘An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution’, 10th Edition (1959), explained the meaning of the Rule of Law which has profound influence on the thoughts in this branch of discipline in Constitutional Law. Dicey summed up at pages-202-3 : <br><br> “That “rule of law,” then, which forms 4 fundamental principle of the constitution, 2 three meanings, or may be regarded from three different points of view. <br>               It means, in the first place, the absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power, and excludes the existence of arbitrariness, of pre- rogative, or even of wide discretionary authori- ty on the part of the government. Englishmen are ruled by the law, and by the law alone; a man may with us be punished for a breach of law, but he can be punished for nothing else.  It means, again, equality before the law, or the equal subjection of all classes to the ordi- nary law of the land administered by the ordi- nary law courts; the “rule of law” in this sense excludes the idea of any exemption of officials or others from the duty of obedience to the law which governs other citizens or from the juris- diction of the ordinary tribunals; ...........-  The “rule of law,” lastly, may be used as a formula for expressing the fact that with us the law of the constitution, the rules which in for- eign countries naturally form part of a constitu- tional code, are not the source but the conse- quence of the rights of individuals, as defined and enforced by the courts; that, in short, the principles of private law have with us been by the action of the courts and Parliament so extended as to determine the position of the Crown and of its servants; thus the constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land.”  ",
      "587. In this connection, it should be noted that ‘Rule of Law’ means, supremacy of law. It means all are treated equally under the Jaw in accordance with the same yardstick of standard as opposed to arbi- trary exercise of power. It means, from the highest in the country to the lowliest, all must submit to law and Jaw alone. It means that there cannot be any divergence of approach in dispensing justice but must be on equal footing in all respect. Above all. it implies the notion of liberty. Besides, so far the Executive is concerned, it must also be a Goverm- ment under the law.  ",
      "585. No wonder, Hamoodur Rahman, CJ, in Asma Jilanis case was very emphatic in holding at page -207 : <br> \"I would not also condone anything which seriously impairs the rights of citizens except in  so far as they may be designed to advance the social welfare and national solidarity.”  Rightly, Yakub Ali, J, sounded a stern warning to the future usurpers at page -243 ;  “My own view is that a person who destroys the national Jegal order jn an illegiti- mate manner cannot be regarded as a valid source of law-making, May be, that on account of his holding the coercive apparatus of the State, the people and the Courts are silenced temporarily, but let it be Jaid down firmly that the order which the usurper imposes will remain illegal and Courts will not recognize its rule and act upon as de jure. As soon as the first opportunity arises, when the consicous apparatus falls from the hands of the usurper he should be tried for high reason and suddenly punished. I his alone will serve as a deterrert to would be adventurers,”  (The underlinings ore ming) <br> Part XKIK The Rule of Law <br> The next question is whether the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, violates the principle of rule of Jaw. We have already held that the Mania) Law Proclamations cle, were all illegal and were issued without Jawful authority. This question has become pertinent because by this amendment new right or obligation, either of the State or its cit- izens has been created, rather, this amendment rati- fied, confirmed and validated the preceding Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the actions taken thereon.  ",
      "584. By invoking the Kelsen’s theory, the above changes can be explained. But this theory of grund norm cannot be used as a legal justification for overthrowing a constitutional government by usurpers. A usurper shall remain a usurper for all time to come since their actions tantamount to dom- inate a free people, not the other way around as in the case of French Revolution. —  ",
      "583. Similarly grund norm was changed on 14th July, 1789 in France and on 14th August, 1947 in British India. Grund norm was also changed on the declaration of independence of Bangladesh on the night following March 25, 1971.  ",
      "582. But grund norm was changed on the dec- laration of Independence by the thirteen colonies of North America on 4th July 1776 which culminated in the formal surrender of Lord Cornwallis in October, 1781.  ",
      "581. We can see that grund norm was not changed during Interregrum although the country was under Commonwealth temporarily. King                Charles II actually ascended the thrown in 1660 but he was deemed to be the King since the death of Charles I in 1649, Legally, there was no existence of Commonwealth but only in history, So also the Martial Law periods.  ",
      "580. The Kelsen's theory of grund-norm can only be used to explain the past incidents and noth- ing more. A Judge in deciding a case may call upon many a legal theory in establishing his own point of view but should not regard it as a precedent.  ",
      "579. It may be noted that even the Privy Council did not approve the Kelson's theory in Madzimbamuto vs Lardner—Burke (1968) 3 All ER 561.  ",
      "578. This kind of illegal Goverment cannot be legitimized by invoking Kelsen’s theory as was done by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Dosso s case and was rightly overruled in Asma Jilant s case.  ",
      "577. This goes for Bangladesh also. Bangla- desh was not made independent, with the sacrifice of three million martyrs, to be ruled by the Martial Law Authorities. This is negation of independence. The Government which fails to govern by consent of the governed fails 10 satisfy the most basic and important criteria for legitimacy, that is to govern by consent. During the period of Martial Law, the peo- ple of Bangladesh was governed not according to their Constitution through their elected representa- tives in the House of Nations but by the Proclamations, MLRs, MLOs etc. and ruled by the Major Generals, Colonels etc. To the Bangalee peo- ple it mattered littke whether they were under the subjugation of the British or the Pakistanies or even the Bangalees. Since they were not governed by their own consent, through their own representa- tives, they were not free and independent and the Government which kept the people of Bangladesh under subjugation, in violation of the Constitution, was out and out an illegal one and shall remain so for all time to come.  ",
      "576. Munir CJ with respect, in his anxiety to bestow legitimization on the Martial Law Authorities in Dosso’s case, chained the people of Pakistan including the then East Pakistan by misin- terpreting Kelsen’s theory. His Lordship further missed the point, again with respect, that the Indian Independence Act, 1947, or the Government of India Act, 1935, did not envisage running of the Dominions with Martial Laws.  ",
      "575. As such to be independent in the real sense, the governance must be with the consent of the people to be governed. In case of existence of a written Constitution, such consent of the people must be strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, which is the embodiment of the will of the people, otherwise, it is no consent and the Government, however powerful it may be, is an ille- gal one. It has no right to gover the people which it sought to do by force, such as, by Martial Law Proclamations. The Governments which sought to rule without the consent of the governed can only be equated with the primitive rule by might, That kind of rule cannot be accepted as legal in the 20th or 21st century.  ",
      "574. From this analysis of historical events for the last four hundred years it would show that mere political independence of a country is not enough. The concept of independence or liberty will not be achieved if one person or a group of persons keep the people of a country under subjugation. The peo- ple has a right to refuse such subjugation although greater independence was offered by making the Kingdom in England as a Commonwealth by Oliver Cromwell. The same result followed in other coun- tries as discussed above.  ",
      "573. The liberation of Bangladesh is a classic example of this kind of independence. The Bangalees spearheaded the independence of Pakistan in 1947 but soon they discovered that they are being treated as a colony by the dominant West Pakistani Rulers. As such, the inevitable happened. The ordinary Bangalees fought against the militari- ly superior West Pakistani Army and jettisoned West Pakistan. Thus independent Bangladesh came into being.  ",
      "572. In France, French Revolution of 1789 swept the whole country. The France was not under subjugation of any other foreign country. It was the most flourishing country In Europe. It reached the height of prosperity in science, arts, culture, philos- ophy and in all other disciplines. The King was French and so also his subjects. But the despotism of Louis XVI left the people helpless. The writings of Voltaire, Montesquicu, Rousseau, Abbe Raynal, Quesnay, Turgot etc. roused the people to revolution with a battle cry for equality, liberty and fraternity. although as a nation, they were independent. Afier deposing the King, the National Assembly made the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens. Some of the rights as declared were as follows: <br> ‘I, Men are born, and always continue. free, and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility. <br> “II ............................ <br> ‘III. The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, or ANY BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it.  ‘IV. Political Liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure another. The exercise of the natural rights of every man, has no other limits than those which are necessary to secure to every other man the free exercise of the same rights; and these limits are deter- minable only by the law.   (Quoted from Thomas Paine : Rights of Man, Pub: Penguin classics 1985, page-110-1).  These historical incidents clearly show that the concept of independence is not only to free a con munity from an alien subjugation but if necessary,                also to free itself from the subjugation of its own people.  ",
      "571. The question of governance arose during the middle of the 18th Century in thirteen North American Colonies. Although most of the people in those colonies had the same culture, Janguage and religion but when they felt that they were being gov- ered through imposition of taxes against their con- sent, in no time they rose as the ‘Sons of Liberty’ and the ultimate result was the Declaration of Independence in the 4th of July, 1776, proclaiming: <br> “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalien- able rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the con- sent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying HS foundation on such principles, and oe rceeen its powers in such form, as to them shal! ne most likely to effect their safety and happiness.  ",
      "570. Lord Fairfax, the Commander in Chief of the Commonwealth with his Second in Command, Lieutenant-General Oliver Cromwell, could defeat the army of King Charles I on a number of occasions but could not won the hearts of the English people. The dream of Cromwell to become the King of England was never fulfilled and he had to remain satisfied with the title Lord Protector. After restora- tion his dead body was exhumed and hanged. During the Interregnum, England was ruled by the Major Generals and Colonels. They could purge the Parliament but could not get the finance, badly needed for maintaining the army. King Charles | was no benevolent ruler, rather, he was a tyrant, still the people of England did not like to be ruled by the Major Generals and Colonels against their will, because whatever might have been his vices, he rep- resented the people as their lawful King.  ",
      "569. In this connection it can be recalled what Justice Mathews emphatically stated six score years ago in the case Yick Wo vs Peter Hopkins (1885) 118 US 356 (Book 30 Law, Ed) (370), We repeat :  Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and source of law; but in our system, while sovereign powers are del- egated to the agencies of government, sover- eignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts.                And the law is the definition and the limitation of power.  History proved that whenever governance was imposed upon people without’their consent or par- ticipation, such govermance was never accepted for long.  ",
      "568. This concept of independence and liberty is not for merely gaining of independence from for- eign Ruler as we obtained independence from the British Monarch and the Emperor of India in 1947 or our owning of Liberation in 1971, The concept of independence and liberty has a deeper and greater connotation. It does not depend upon formal inde- pendence. It goes to the root of the concept of gov- ernance by the people themselves. It is based on the concept of equality that all men are equal and no one can govern others without his consent because with- out such consent, however beneficent the Ruler may be, it will be a negation of democratic spirit. Whether it is the Monarch or a Federal form of Government or a Parliamentary form of Govern- ment, all forms of governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, because the ultimate sovereignty lies with the people. This sovereignty of the people can never be ignored.  ",
      "567. Democracy is a way of life. It cannot be begotten over-night. [t cannot be handed down in a silver platter, It has to be earned. It has to be owned It has to be nurtured. The world history is replete with stories of people who fought for their rights in different names, in different countries, in different ages, but the cry for liberty, the cry for equality, the cry for fraternity, were reverbrated, may be in dif- ferent language but in the same manner from hori- zon to horizon. This sense of liberty pushed us to the war of liberation in 1971 and brought Bangladesh into existence. But the proclamation of Martial Law is negation of the said very spirit of liberty and inde- pendence of the people of Bangladesh.  ",
      "566. It appears that all usurpers seize powers though fully and wholly illegally but ironically always in the name of God and the people, But all the usurpers very conveniently forget that even in the early Seventh century Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique (R) did not seize power but relied on the confidence of the people because he believed that the blessings of God lies in the free will and consent of His cre- ation,  ",
      "565. It may be stated incidentally that in 1982, Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, ndc, psc, Chief of staff, Bangladesh Army, seized all and full powers of the Government of Bangladesh “with the help and mercy of Almighty Allah and blessings of our great patriotic people...”  ",
      "564. Nearly three hundred and fifty years later in 1958, Major General Iskander Mirza, the President of Pakistan with the aid of General Ayub Khan, the Commander in Chief of Army of Pakistan, very conveniently abrogated the Constitution, started to make laws by proclamations and set-up Martial Law Courts. And these were done by invoking in aid his “foremost duty before God and the people of Pakistan to maintain the integrity of Pakistan.” 17 (Seventeen) years later, in August 1975, Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed seized the office of President of Bangladesh “with the help and mercy of the Almighty Allah and relying upon the blessings of the people...”  ",
      "563. With this beginning, the people of England started to exercise their own right, even the right to be ruled by a King. In 1610, on the question of the power of the King to issue proclamations, the commons were agitated and ultimately the King James 1, had to yield.  ",
      "522. This action in respect of the aforesaid Act of 1907, was commenced in August, 1923, 16 years after the enactment, still Orde, J not only entertained the action but was of the opinion that the act was ultra vires the Parliament of Canada. His opinion was upheld by the Privy Council. Even after lapse of so many years, Viscount Haldane on behalf of the Board held at page- 400 : <br> “It is always with reluctance that their Lordships come to a conclusion adverse to the constitutional validity of any Canadian statute that has been before the public for years as hav- ing been validly enacted. but the duty incum- bent on the Judicial Committee. now as always is simply to intepret the British North America  Although there was no involvement or participation of the ordinary people in signing the Magna Carta but with its acceptance the King of England who used to rule by divine right, recognized for the first time the concept of ruling by ‘consent’ of the ruled, the ordinary subjects of his Kingdom. This was the beginning of the participation of the people although within a very limited class.  ",
      "521. Now let us consider a few decisions in this respect. In the case of Toronto Electric Commissioners vs Snider 1925 AC 396 PC, the question was whether the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, 1907 of Canada, was within the competence of the Parliament of Canada under the British North America Act, 1867.  ",
      "520. There is no law of limitation in challeng- ing an unconstitutional action, conduct, behaviour or acts. In such a situation, the cause of action is recurring till such acts are judicially considered. Constitutional questions are of utmost national as well as of legal interest and mere collateral observa- tion does not carry much of an importance than a bare passing remark without any conviction.  ",
      "519. The United States of America during its long and eventful history, also passed through many a turbulent periods but none of its amendments was made for anything but further advancement of civi- lization and humanity. This is the true spirit for amendment of a Constitution, the supreme law of the Republic, but not to legalise illegal acts. Its pur- pose is not to engineer or as a device to hide the ille- gal activities of usurpers or dictators but for ackies - ing further improvements, further refinements of t he constitutional position of the citizens ofa Republic. If the Court finds that the amendment 1s affected for a collateral and illegal purpose, the Court will not be slow to declare it so in exercise of its high constitu- tional duties ordained upon it.  ",
      "518. In this connection it should be remem- bered that the amendment under question is not like the Fifth Amendment of the United States providing that without indictment before the Grand Jury no one should be held liable for serious offence or other amendments of its Constitution, every one of which are beneficial to the human race. On the other hand, the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, of Bangladesh, sought to legalise and validate the Martial Law Proclamations etc. subordinating the Constitution. Each and every 28 (twenty eight) amendments of the United States Constitution, made during the last more than two hundred years of its history, was for further improvement, further advancement, further enlightenment of the constitu- tional position of its citizens, Whereas, our Fifth Amendment destroyed the very fabrics of the con- cept of justice and concept of fairness, in legalizing all illegal Martial Law Proclamations etc, While with each amendment of the Constitution, the citi- zens of the United States inched towards further refinements but with this one amendment, the citi- zens of Bangladesh immersed in the other direction.  ",
      "517. If the Constitution is wronged, it is a grave offence of unfathomed enormity committed against each and every citizens of the Republic. It is a continuing and recurring wrong committed against the Republic itself. It remains a wrong against future generations of citizens. As such, there cannot be any plea of waiver or acquiescence in respect of uncon- stitutionality of a provision or an act.  ",
      "516. Our clear and explicit answer is that mak- ing of the Constitution subordinate and subservient to the Martial Law Proclamations MLR», MLOs etc., are absolutely illegal void and non-est in the eye of law. Any attempt to legalise this illegality in any manner or method and by any Authority or Institution, how high so ever, is also void and non- est and remains so for ever.  ",
      "516. Similarly, if there is a violation of law, it remains a violation for all time to come with conse- quential and inevitable results. The law of adverse possession has got no application in case of uncon- stitutional acts and events. One must not loose sight that the Constitution is supreme and every person in the Republic, be he is a servant of the Republic or an ordinary citizen, owe his unquestionable, unquali- fied and absolute loyalty to the Constitution. Any attempt to deface the Constitution or to make it sub- servient tantamounts to the offence of sedition of worst kind. The Fifth Amendment sought to legalise such offences committed by the Martial Law Authorities and the learned the Advocates for the respondents submitted that it cannot be questioned, because those Proclamations etc, were made by the Martial Law Authorities, that the Fifth Amendment itself provided that the ratification, confirmation and the validation of those Proclamations etc. and the actions taken thereon cannot be questioned before any Court, that it is beyond question because no body challenged those in all these years, as such, deemed to be waived or acquiesced. Those argu-                ments are neither legal nor logical, Those arguments would not have been accepted even before the Star Chamber not to speak in the dawn of 21st century.  ",
      "515. This proposition is anything but correct. Conclusions or inferences based on the facts and cir- cumstances may vary with the change of social out- look or political situation but what is legally wrong remains wrong for ever.  ",
      "514. We have already found that the Martial Law Proclamations etc. not only changed the basic structure of the Constitution but also made this supreme law, subordinate and subservient to those Proclamations etc. This was also found in Halima Khatun’s case and the subsequent other decisions. Shahabuddin Ahmed, J in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury's Case himself held at para- 331: <br> “331 . Within a short time came the first Martial Law which lasted for four years, By Martial Law Proclamation Orders the Constitution was badly mauled on 10 times Secularism, one of the Fundamental State Principles, was replaced by _“Bismillah-er- Rahmar-Ar-Rahim\" in the Constitution and Socialiasm was given a different meaning Supreme Court one of the symbols of national unity was bifurcated for about two years and then was restored. All these structural changes were incorporated in and ratified as the Constitution Fifth Amendment Act. 1979\"  Let us now consider the contention that whether the vires of the Martial Law Proclamation etc. and the Fifth Amendment, has become barred by waiver and acquiescence, due to long delay in challenging those provisions. It was further contended that this delay shows that the people of Bangladesh had already accepted the Fifth Amendment, ratifying the Martial Law Proclamations etc.  ",
      "513. We have found that the Constitution is supreme. All organs of the Republic emanate from the Constitution. The Parliament can enact any law but subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The Parliament can also amend any provision of the Constitution but thereby cannot change its basic character.  ",
      "512. We have already made lengthy discus- sions above on the questions of supremacy of the Constitution, the powers of the Parliament to enact any law including amendment of the provisions of the Constitution.  ",
      "510. In this connection, the decision of the Supreme Court of India in the case of B Prabhakar Rao vs State of A.P AIR 1986 SC 210 is pertinent: <br> “23, a writ petition similar to Writ Petitions Nos. 3420-3426/83 etc. had been filed earlier and had been dismissed in limine by a Bench of this Court, We do not see how the dismissal in /imine of such a writ petition can possibly bar the present writ petitions. Such a dismissal in limine may inhibit our discretion but not our jurisdiction. So the objection such as it was, was not pursued further.” (page-227)-                 Part XXVII Waiver and Acquiescence by Delay  The next contention raised on behalf of the respondent no, 3 is that since no body challenged the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act 1979, for all these years, that was deemed to be accepted by the people and the vires of the said Act cannot now be re-opened, more so in view of the observation of Shahabuddin Ahmed, J, made in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury & Case, This observation was also noted _ and followed in rejecting the Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 . In that view of the matter, Mr Akhter Imam, Advocate, submitted that the vires of the Fifth Amendment Act, cannot now be re-opened, The learned Additional Attorney-General, though feebly but supported the said contention of Mr Imam.  ",
      "509. Under the circumstances, on both these two grounds, the contention that the present petition is barred under the principle of res judicata, has got no substance.  ",
      "507. It appears that the legality of either the Martial Law Proclamations or that of the Filth Amendment was not finally decided in the Order summarily rejecting the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994 . Such summary rejection does not debar chal- lenging of those provisions in a subsequently filed Writ petition, on the principle of res judicata, since no such issue had been raised therein or heard and finally decided by the said Court, The sine qua non for application of the principle of res judicata is the finality of a decision in an earlier action, Since no rule was issued in the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994, the summary order passed in the said writ petition in the absence of the respondents therein, do not oper- ate as res judicata in the present Writ petition.  508, Besides, the vires of the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act No. | of 1979), was not under challenge in the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994, This will also be apparent from the obser- vation of Mustafa Kamal, CJ, in dismissing the Civil Appeal No. 15 of 1997:  \" ............Also, the vires of Act No, 1 of 1979 is not under challenge in this appeal.” <br>                In the present writ petition No. 6016 of 2000, the cause-title reads as follows: \"In the matter of  Paragraph 18 of the Fourth Schedule under Article 150 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh added by the Constitu- tion (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act 1 of 1979) purported to ratify and confirm. The Abandoned Property (Supplementary Provi- sions) Regulation, 1977 (Martial Law Regula- tions No. VII of 1977) and the proclamations (Amendment) order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) inserting Paragraph 3.A to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh;”  The prayers in the present Writ petition reads as follows: <br> “(A) Pass an order or orders issuing Rule Nisi upon the respondents calling upon them as to why taking over the management of “M/s Moon Cinema” 11, Wise Ghat, Dhaka by/under Notification No. 186-S1 dated 31st December, 1971 published in the Bangladesh Gazette, Extraordinary dated 3rd January, 1972 and its place- ment with respondent No. 3 for management by Notification No. IM-  XV-36/72/531 dated 15th December, 1972 published in Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary dated 4th January, 1973 and all subsequent actions, deeds and documents relating thereto should not be declared to have been made without Jawful authority and to be of no legal effects and to further show cause as to why purported “ratification and confir- mation” of The Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation, 1977 (Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977) and Proclamations (Amend- ment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) with regard to insertion of Paragraph 3A to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution by Paragraph 18 of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh added by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act 1 of 1979) should not be declared to have been made without lawful authority and of no legal effect and as to why the respon- dents should not be directed to hand over “Moon Cinema” 11, Wise Ghat Road, Dhaka with its assets and man- agement to the petitioners.  <br> (B) ... \"  It is obvious and apparent that the issues in Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 and the issues in the pres- ent Writ Petition are altogether different. The deci- sion of the Court in Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 was in respect of the Notification dated 24-5-1977 . The Court summarily rejected the petition praying for handing over the concemed property in favour of the petitioner-company. But no Rule was issued and no issue could be said to be finally decided in the said writ petition, either in respect of the aforesaid notifi- cation or any of the Martial Law Proclamations etc. and its ratification, confirmation and validation by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979.  ",
      "506. From the plain reading of the Order dated 7-6-1994 in the Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994, it appears that the petitioner in the said writ petition prayed for a direction upon the Government of Bangladesh and another (presumably Bangladesh Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust), to make over pos- session of the Moon Cinema Hall, to the petitioners in pursuance to the above noted Notification dated 248-1977 (Annexures-D). In the said weit petition all that the petitioners wanted was to enforce the order dated 15-6-1977, passed in the earlier Writ Petition No, 67 of 1976, Butat the time of moving the petition apparently on various points, such as, the legality of Martial Law Proclamations ete, or its subsequent ratification by the FIN Amendment of the Constitution appeared to have been incidental ly raised, However, no Rule was issued cither on the specific prayer made in the Writ Petition or on any of the points of law but was summarily rejected on the basis of a passing and incidental observation made by Shahabuddin Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was), in reply to a contention raised by Mr M. Nurullah, the learned Attorney-General in Amar Hossain Chowdhury’s case, apparently without appreciating the context of that observation. Besides, Fifth Amendment was not the issue in the said case, it was not even argued by any of the par- ties in the said case.  ",
      "505. In this back-ground, the Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994, was filed but no Rule was issued and there was no appearance on behalf of the respon- dents. However, it was summarily rejected on 7-6- 1994, In the said writ petition, the cause-title reads as follows:   <br>               “In the matter of Enforcement: of Fundamental Rights as guarantend in the Constitution and for direction upon the Respondents to deliver the possession of the “Moon Cinema House” situated at MN, Wiseghat, Dhaka to the petitioners,”  The prayer of the petitioner, mrer alia, was as follows: <br> “(a) A Rule Nisi may be issued calling upon the Respondents to show cause as to why they shall not be directed to make over possession of the Moon Cinema Hall at 11, Wise Ghat, Dhaka, to the petitioners pursuant to Gazette Notifi- cation No. IND/(M-1)/4 (2)/72/11 dated 24-8-77 (Annexure-D) issued by Respondent No. 1;”  The Notification referred to above as Annexure- D. is annexed as Annexure—J in the instant Writ peti- tion as one of the annexures. It reads as follows:  “No. ND/(N-1)/4(2)/72/11 Dacca dated 24th August, 1977 NOTIFICATION  In compliance with the Honorable High Court’s Judgment dated the 15th June, 1977 in the Writ petition No. 67 of 1976, MOON CIN- EMA I], Wiseghat Road, Dacca is deleted form the list published under the Ministry of Industries Notification No. 186-SI dated 31-12- 197 and N1]. M/XV/72/531 dt. 15-12-1972 and the cinema is released in favour of the petition- er M/S. Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd, 12, Dilkusha Commercial Area, Dacca.”  ",
      "504. The contempt proceedings continued for quite a some time but ultimately withdraw in 1994.  ",
      "503. In order to understand and appreciate this plea we would hark back to 1976 . Admittedly, the petitioner company is the owner of the Moon Cinema Hall premises. The said property was declared abandoned. This was challenged in Writ Petition No. 67 of 1976 . The High Court Division, in its Judgment dated 15-6-1977, found that the said property was not an abandoned property, as such, directed release of the same in favour of the peti- tioner-company forthwith. But the respondents refused to comply with the direction of the Court on the plea that in view of the provisions of the Abandoned Property (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation, 1977 (MLR No. VII of 1977), promul- gated on 7-10-1977, the Judgment and Order of the High Court Division, stood annulled.  ",
      "502. Let us now examine on facts whether the present Writ petition is barred by the principle of res judicata.  ",
      "501. The principle of res judicata has been stated in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is a well settled principle of Jaw that if an issue was finally decided in an earlier proceeding, the same issue shall operate as res judicata, in a subse- quent proceeding between the same parties as against the same issue. The same principle applies to Writ proceedings aIso (AIR 1998 SC 2046).  ",
      "500. On the other hand, Mr Ajmalul Hossain, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, strenuously submitted that the issues involved in the Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 are entirely different from the issues involved in this writ petition. Besides, he submitted that since no Rule was issued in the said earlier writ petition but was summarily rejected the same cannot operate as a res judicata for this writ petition on which a Rule was issued on entirely dif-  ferent points of law. Dr Rafiqur Rahman, amicus curiae, in supporting Mr Hossain, submitted that the present writ petition is not barred by the principle of res judicata since any of the issues raised in this peti- tion were not finally and conclusively decided earli- er. He stressed on the ‘finality’ and ‘conclusiveness’ of the decision, if it is to be treated as res judicata.  ",
      "499. The plea of res judicata was raised on the ground that earlier the petitioners filed another writ petition being Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 . The said writ petition although was summarily rejected but with an elaborate Judgment, considering all the issues raised in the instant writ petition, such as, the vires of the Proclamation etc. and the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution but since all those issues had already been decided in the earlier Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994, the learned Additional Attorney-General and Mr Akhtar Imam, the learned Advocate for the respondent No, 3, both submitted that the present writ petition is not maintainable as barred by the principle of res judicata.  ",
      "3. Its such plea was supported by the respondent No. 1.    ",
      "497. It appears that Paragraph 3A and 18 to the Fourth Schedule, sought to ratify, confirm, validate                and legalise all illegal and illegitimate provisions of Martial Law Proclamations, Martial Law Regula- tions and Martial Law Orders. Those Provisions and the actions taken thereon in violation of the Constitution, were not only illegal but seditious acts on the part of the Martial Law Authorities, as such, by any stretch of imagination, those provisions and the actions taken thereon come within the ambit of the word “ ” or ‘transitional’. As such, those unconstitutional provisions were wrongly and illegally thrust in to the Fourth Schedule presumably in the garb of transitional and temporary provisions and thereby a fraud has been committed on the Constitution by such amendments.  Part XXVI The Plea of Res judicata  The Plea of res judicata was raised in this writ petition on behalf of the respondent No. ",
      "496. The Constitution is a sacred document, because it is the embodiment of the will of the peo- ple of Bangladesh. It is not to be treated as a log book of Martial Rules.  ",
      "495. Article 150 is certainly not meant to be abused by the usurpers for post facto legalization of their illegal and illegitimate activities which were beyond the ambit of the Constitution, As a matter of fact, realizing that all the Martial Law Proclamations etc, were un-constitutional, they sought to make those legal by incorporating those provisions as part of the Constitution, But the Fourth Schedule is not meant for dumping ground for ille- gal provisions, Rather, what is wrong and illegal remains so for all time to come. Besides, no one can take advantage of his own wrongs.  ",
      "494. During the period between August 15, 1975 to April 9, 1979, the Constitution was made subordinate and subservient to the Martial Law Proclamations etc. The provisions of the Constitution was changed at the whims and caprices of the usurpers and dictators. We have already found that during the said period democracy was replaced by dictatorship and since November 1975, on the dissolution of the National Assembly, Bangladesh lost its republican character. Besides, Bangladesh can not even be considered independent during the said period. Earlier, it was conquered by the British Rulers, thereafter it was under the domination of the West Pakistanis. But this time, for all practical pur- poses, Bangladesh was conquered not by any for- eign invaders but by Bengali speaking Martial Law Authorities.  ",
      "493. It is very true that the Parliament by fol- lowing the procedure mentioned in Article 142, may add any provision in the Constitution so long Its basic structure is not disturbed but Article 150 is a special provision. It deals with only the transitional and temporary provisions prior to the commence- ment of the Constitution. This provision cannot be used to enlarge the Fourth Schedule, by addition of the provisions which related to the period after the commencement of the Constitution. If necessary, the Parliament may add any provision to the Constitu- tion by way of amendment, without, however, changing its basic character but cannot enlarge the Fourth Schedule by adding any provision which is not a provision made during ‘Gfeerl7’ (‘transition- al’) which ended with the enactment and commence- ment of the Constitution on December 16, 1972.  ",
      "492. In reply to our query as to how further provisions were included in the Fourth Schedule, the learned Additional Attorney-General contended that following the procedure mentioned in Article 142, further provisions were included by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, as such, those are legal and valid. But when it is pointed out to him that if the provisions which were sought to be rati- fied, confirmed and validated by the said Fifth Amendment, are found to be illegal then how the validation as well as the instrument itself by which those illegal provisions were validated would be legal, he had no answer.  ",
      "491. From these words it is so very clear that the purpose of Article 150 of the Constitution is only to protect various provisions, functions of different functionaries and all other actions taken since the declaration of independence and till the commence- ment of the Constitution. As such, the purpose of Article 150 is limited apparently only for that peri- od and for a specific purpose.  ",
      "490. The meaning of the word ‘temporary’ according to the Oxford Dictionary is ‘lasting or meant to last only for a limited time’ and according to the Chambers Dictionary is ‘lasting for a time only, transient, impermanent, provisional’.  ",
      "489. As such, the purpose of Article 150 is limited upto the commencement of the Constitution and of any period mentioned in the Fourth Schedule. The ambit of this Article can not be extended beyond the commencement of the Constitution or any period mentioned in the Fourth Schedule. In this regard we must keep in view the words ‘transition- al’ and ‘temporary’ appearing in Article 150 . In the Bengali text of the Article 150 words Tifa ‘and ‘’ are used. The ordinary dictionary mean- ing of the word ‘\" according to the Bengali Dictionary, published by Bangla Academy, 6th Edition, March, 2005, is’ and the meaning of the word  Similarly, the meaning                of the word ‘transition’ according to The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, Edited by Sara Tulloch, 1097, is ‘a passing or change from one place, state, condition, etc., to another (an age of transition’). According to The Chambers Dictionary, Deluxe Edition, Indian Edition, 1993, the meaning of the word ‘transition’ is passage from one place, state, stage, Style or subject to another.  ",
      "488. Jurisprudentially, the necessity for provi- sions for transitional and temporary provisions can- not be ignored. The provisions are generally made for the purpose of transition from the old legal order to a new one to ensure continuity of the legality of the new State. As such, of necessity, these provi- sions were made so that no legal vacuum occurs during the period from the time when a new nation came into existence till a Constitution of the said nation is framed. Obviously these provisions by its very nature, character and purpose, are of transition- al and also of temporary status and ambit. The facts, circumstances and incidents leading to the making of those interim measures were necessary for the smooth transition and continuance of the functions of the young Republic of Bangladesh as a legal enti- ty of a Republic. Those interim measures were a legal necessity and could not be avoided.  ",
      "487. These are the original provisions con- tained in the Fourth Schedule. These a prre provided in pursuance to Article 150 . These provisions were necessary to protect various laws, actions and deci- sions, made, taken or pronounced since the declara- tion of Independence on March 26, 1971.    ",
      "486. After independence, the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh was created by the elected representatives of this country, elected both in the National Assembly and also in the Provincial Assembly, held in December, 1970 and in January, 1971, in the erstwhile East Pakistan. This Constituent Assembly framed the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh. This Constitution was enacted and commenced on December 16, 1972 . Having thus fulfilled its func- tions as the Constituent Assembly, on the com- mencement of the Constitution, it stood dissolved. This obviously was a past and closed transaction and was stated so at paragraph | of the Fourth Schedule.  Paragraph-2 of the Fourth Schedule stated about the holding of the first general election of the members of Parliament. <br> Paragraph-3 provides for continuity of the Government of Bangladesh and the laws and the powers exercised between the 26th day of March, 1971 and the commencement of the Constitution.  Paragraph—4 provides that the persons holding the office of the President of Bangladesh, the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Constituent Assembly, immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, would be deemed to hold the said office respectively till they are duly elected in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution,  Likewise, paragraph-5 provides that the per- sons holding the office of the Prime Minister and other Ministers, immediately before commencement of the Constitution, would be deemed to hold the said office, till the holding of the first general elec-                tion and appointment of the Prime Minister and other Ministers.  Paragraph-6 provides that the persons who was holding the office of the Chief Justice and every other person who held office as Judge of the High Court immediately prior to the date of the com- mencement of the Constitution, as from that date, held office as the Chief Justice and as a Judge, as the case may be. Besides, all legal proceedings, pending before the Appellate Division of the High Court and the High Court stood transferred to the Appellate Division and the High Court Division of the Supreme Court respectively.  Paragraph-7 provided for the interim rights of appeal before the Appellate Division, in respect of any judgment etc. since the 1st day of March, 1971, passed by the High Court, in accordance with the provisions of Article 103.  Paragraph-8 provided that the Election Com- mission existed immediately before the commence- ment of the Constitution and the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners were deemed to be the Election Commission and also the Election Commissioners. <br> Paragraph-9 provides for the existence of the Public Service Commission and its chairman and members and its continuance after the commence- ment of the Constitution. <br> Paragraph-10 provides for the existence of the Public Services and its continuance on the com- mencement of the Constitution. <br> Paragraph-1] provides for Oaths for the contin- uance in office. <br> Paragraph-13, 14 and 15 deal with the taxation, interim financial arrangements and audit of past accounts, - <br> . Paragraph-16 deals with the property, assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of the Government. <br> Paragraph-17 deals with the adaptation of laws and removal of difficulties for the purpose of bring-   ing the provisions of the laws in force in Bangladesh in conformity with the Constitution, within the peri- od of two years from the commencement of the Constitution.   ",
      "485. Paragraph-1 of the Fourth Schedule deals with the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. Para-] reads as follows : <br> “1 . Upon the commencement of the Cons- titution, the Constituent Assembly, having dis- charged its responsibility of framing a Constitu- tion for the Republic, shall stand dissolved.”  It may be noted that the first general election in the erstwhile Pakistan was held in December, 1970. Its pre-dominant purpose was to frame a Constitution for the entire Pakistan, The National Assembly was due to be convened on March 3, 197] but it was indefinitely postponed on March 1, 1971. This postponement of holding of the National Assembly had serious repercussions all over Pakistan specially in the erstwhile East Pakistan, The Army Rulers of Pakistan unleashed a reign of terror and a genocide on the unarmed people of the erstwhile East Pakistan. Consequently, Indepen- dence of Bangladesh was declared on the March 26. 1971, as a Sovereign Independent Republic.  ",
      "484. Both Article 150 and heading of the Fourth Schedule show that the said Article, as well as the Fourth schedule, as set out in pursuance to Article 150, deals with transitional interim meas- ures. A brief examination of the provisions original- ly contained in the Fourth Schedule with its English text, would make it clear.  ",
      "483. The heading of the Fourth Schedule reads as . Its English version is ‘Transitional and temporary provisions’.  ",
      "482. Article 150 of the Constitution provides that transitional and temporary provisions would be set out in the Fourth schedule. This provision finds its place almost at the end of the Constitution, It is preceded by Article 149, the saving clauses for the existing laws and followed by three other Articles, namely, Article 151, which deals with the repeal of certain President’s Orders, Article 152 narrates the interpretations of various words and Article 153 pro- vides the date of commencement of the Constitu- tion, its citation and authenticity.                 <br> Article 150 reads as follows :  The English Tent is: <br> “150 . The transitional_and temporary pro- visions set out in the Fourth Schedule shall have effect notwithstanding any other provisions of this Constitution.”  In pursuance to the above Article in the Cons- titution, various transitional and temporary provi- sions were set out in details in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "481. By virtue of the above two Proclamation Orders all the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs were validated and were entered in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution as paragraph 3A and 6B while paragraph 6A was inserted there earlier by Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976 . Since it was known that in the face of the Constitution, those amendments would be void ab initio, as such, amendment of the Constitution itself was made in a bid to validate those Proclamations etc. by the Fifth Amendment. <br> Part XXV Incorporation of Paragraph 3A and 18 to the Fourth Schedule : <br> Next we shall consider the legality of incorpo- ration of paragraph 3A and 18 to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "480. It should be noted that earlier the English Version of the above noted Articles were amended by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977  (Proclamations Order No. | of 1977). The preamble of the said Order reads as follows:  [Published in the Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 23rd April, 1977] <br> THE PROCLAMATIONS (AMENDMENT) ORDER, 1977. Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977. <br> Whereas it is expedient further to amend the Proclamation of the 8th November, 1975. and to amend the Third Proclamation of the 29th November 1976, for the purpose here- inafter appearing,  Now, therefore, in pursuance of the Third Proclamation of the 29th November, 1976, read with the proclamations of the 20th August 1975, and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator in pleased to make the following order : <br> By the above Order, only the English version of the relevant provisions of the Constitution were amended leaving the original authenticated Constitution in Bengali intact. Presumably on detec- tion of this lapse, the relevant Articles of the Constitution in Bengali, were again amended by The Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978). This Order, however, started with the following false pretexts stated earlier above for the amend- ments contained in the preamble: <br> THE SECOND PROCLAMATION (FITEENTH AMENDMENT) ORDER, 1978, Second Proclamation Order No, IV of 1978. <br> Whereas there has been persistent demand for the repeal of the undemocratic provisions of the Constitution incorporated therein by the Constitution by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975:                 <br>           AND <br> Whereas some of such undemocratic pro- visions have already been repeated by the Presi- dent and the Chief Martial Law Administrator, <br> AND <br> WHEREAS the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator, in response to the said popular demand pledged to the nation to repeal the remaining undemocratic provisions after obtaining mandate from the people in the election to the office of President and he has obtained that mandate; <br> AND <br> WHEREAS it is expedient further to amend the Proclamation of the 8th November, 1975, for the purposes of fulfilling the said pledge and other purposes hereinafter appearing;  Now, therefore in pursuance to the Third Proclamation of the 29th November, 1976, read with the Proclamations of the 20th August, 1975, and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator is pleased to make the following Order: (The underlinings are mine)  The pretexts to amend the Constitution in the above manner in the garb of repealing the undemo- cratic provisions of the Constitution incorporated therein by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975, was altogether misconceived. Firstly because the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, whatever its political merits or demerits, it was brought about by the representatives of the people by an overwhelming majority members of a sover- eign Parliament. Secondly, however undemocratic, the Fourth Amendment may appear to an army com- mander, the amendment of the Constitution, could not be made even by the President or the CMLA or  any person, how high so ever, but only by a Parliament. Thirdly, Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc being an usurper to the Office of the President and in the Office of the legally non-exis- tent Chief Martial Law Administrator, had no authority to change the Constitution. As an Officer of the Defence Services, he took oath to protect the Constitution of Bangladesh, but instead, on April 23. 1977, only two days after assuming the office of President, he illegally and without any lawful authority amended the various provisions of the Constitution which were the fundamental basis for the struggle for Liberation, by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, and made the secular Republic of Bangladesh, a theocratic State, thereby the cause of the Liberation War of Bangladesh was betrayed.  ",
      "479. Jn pursuance to the above Order the orig- inal Bengali text of the part of the Preamble, Articles 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 25(2) and the Proviso to Article-38 were amended on the false pretext of persistent demand to repeal the undemocratic provisions although the aforesaid provisions are all the glorious basic features of the Constitution and had no nexus with the Fourth Amendment. All these changes of the basic structures of the Constitution were sought to be ratified, confirmed and validated by the Fifth Amendment apparently by playing fraud upon the members of the Second Parliament.  ",
      "478. Those Martial Law Proclamation Orders of 1975, 1976 and 1977 were incorporated in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution by its amend- ment as Paragraph 3A. The English versions of the provisions discussed above were changed, deleted and modified by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. | of 1977). The Bengali versions of those very provisions were subsequently added, deleted or amended by The Second Proclamations (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978).  ",
      "477. We have discussed above the various provisions of the Constitution. Those provisions were not only the basic features of the Constitution but were also the ideals for the struggle for libera- tion, the comer stone of our Constitution. Those ideals were the basis for the birth of the Republic of Bangladesh. But those basic features of the Constitution were changed by the various Martial Law Proclamations.  ",
      "476. With the same object to destroy the secu- lar character of the Republic and its Constitution. the proviso to Article 38 was omitted by the Second Proclamation (Sixth Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. III of 1976). The ginal Article-38 with its proviso reads as follows:  The English Text is : <br> “38 . Every citizen shall have the right to form associations or unions, subject to any rea- sonable restrictions imposed by law in the inter- ests of morality or public order:  Provided that no person shall have the right to form, or be a member or otherwise take part in the activities of, any communal or other asso- ciation or union which in the name or on the basis of any religion has for its object, or pur- sues, a political purpose.”  The above noted proviso to Article-38 was meant to protect the secular character of the Republic of Bangladesh in spite of one’s fundamen- tal right to form an association as envisaged in Article-38, but the above proviso was omitted by the Second Proclamation Order No. III of 1976, made by Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, a nomi-                nated President of Bangladesh and CMLA. Since the secular character of the Republic was one of the objectives of the struggle for liberation, the omis- sion of the aforesaid provision from the Constitution, as a bid or devise to change its such basic character, tantamounts to changing of the basic feature of the Constitution,  ",
      "475. The efforts to high light the secular Bangladesh into a Muslim country were even made clear from addition of clause 2 to original Article-25 of the Constitution, The original Article-25 was as follows:                The English Text is : <br> 25 . The State shall base its international rela- tions on the principles of respect for national sover- eignty and equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, peaceful settlement of international disputes, and respect for international law and the principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter, and on the basis or those principles shall— <br> (2) strive for the renunciation of the use of force in international relations and for general and complete disarmament; <br> (b)uphold the right of every people freely to determine and build up its own social, economic and political system by ways and means of its own free choice; and <br> (c)support oppressed peoples throughout the world waging a just struggle against imperialism, colonialism or racialism.  But by the Proclamations Order No. | of 1977, clause-2 was added: <br> “2 . The state shall endeavor to consolidate, preserve and strengthen fraternal relations among Muslim countries based on Islamic soli- darity.”  This clause-2 is redundant. The original Article- 25 itself provides for promotion of international peace, security and solidarity amongst all the nations including of course, the Muslim countries, in accordance with the charter of the United Nations. As such, its endeavor to foster further rela- tions amongst only with the Muslim countries based on Islamic solidarity, as stated in the added clause- 2, can only be explained by its leaning towards becoming an Islamic Republic from a Secular Republic and thereby destroying its one of the most important and significant basic feature of our Constitution, namely, secularism.  ",
      "474. Secularism was one of the ideals for which the ‘struggle for liberation was fought and own and the framers of the Constitution in their wis- dom in order to dispel any confusion, upheld and protect the said ideal of secularism as spelt it out in Article-12 of the Constitution as one of the funda- mental principles of State Policy. Indeed this was one of. the most important basic features of the Constitution. But the said basic feature of the Constitution was deleted by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978 and thereby sought to change the secular character of the Republic of Bangladesh as enshrined in the original Constitution.  ",
      "473. Article-12 dealt with secularism and free- dom of religion. Article-12 reads as follows: The English Text is :  12 . The principle of secularism shall be realized by the elimination of— <br> (a) communalism in all its forms; <br> (b) the granting by the State of political sta- tus in favour of any religion; <br> (c) the abuse of religion for political pur- poses; <br> (d) any discrimination against, or persecu- tion of, persons practicing a particular religion. <br> This provision of secularism explained and expounded in Article 12, is one of the most impor- tant and unique basic features of the Constitution, Secularism means both religious tolerance as well as religious freedom. It envisages equal treatment to all irrespective of caste, creed or religion but the State must not show any form of tilt or leaning towards any particular religion either directly or even remotely. It requires maintenance of strict neutrality on the part of the State in the matters of different religions professed by various communities in the State. The State must not seen to be favouring any particular religion, rather, ensure protection to the followers of all faiths without any discrimination including even to an atheist. This is what it means by the principle of secularism.  ",
      "472. Next we shall consider the omission of Article 12 altogether from the Constitution by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977.  ",
      "471. In this connection, it should be remem- bered that a provision in the Constitution gives only the basic law with wide ideas and the Parliament enacts laws to give effect to those ideas. If we exam- ine the substituted Article-9 and Article-10 it would appear that Article-11 read with Article 59 and 60 and Article-2§ serves the purposes of those two sub- stituted provisions very well and as a matter of fact those two Articles are redundant and apparently were substituted only to camouflage the original Article-9 and the original Article-10 which were two hasic features of our Constitution.  ",
      "470. We have a shrewed suspicion that the substituted Article-9 and Article-10 were incorporat- ed in the Constitution only as an excuse for deleting the original provisions because both the substituted provisions are well provided for, Article-11 read with. Articles 59 and 60 covers the substituted Article-9 while Article-28 takes care of the substi- tuted Article-10.                ",
      "469. Without going into the merit of the sub- stituted Article 10, we admit that we do not find any plausible reason to delete such a glorious provision for the salvation of fellow human being.  ",
      "468. This substituted provision has no nexus with the original provision which spelt out estab- lishment of a socialistic economic system and exploitation free society for Bangladesh. The people of Bangladesh dreamt of such a society for ages. In order to establish such an idealistic society the peo- ple of Bangladesh gave their lives. As such, the pro- vision containing such idealism, very rightly found its place in the Constitution as one of the fundamen- tal principles of State Policy. This being one of the basis for our struggle for liberation, this provision was one of the basic structures of the Constitution.  ",
      "467. This is one of the fundamental ideals on which the struggle for national liberation was fought, as such, spelt out in the Constitution as one of its basic structures. But the Proclamations Order No. | of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, deleted the said magnanimous pro- vision and substituted it with the following: <br> “10, Steps shall be taken to ensure partici- pation of women in all spheres of national life.” <br> This Provision provides for participation of women in national life but this is already well pro- vided for in Article 28, as such, this substitution was unnecessary and redundant.  ",
      "466. The original Article 10 contained the pro- vision for socialism and freedom from exploitation. This Article reads as follows:  The English Text ts: “10, A socialist economic system shall he established with a view to ensuring the attain. ment of a just and egalitarian society, free fron the exploitation of man hy man.”  ",
      "465. We have olready seen the Article 9 above in the original Constitution before its amendment. Afier amendment by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977, the substituted Article 9 reads as follows : <br> “9 . The state shall encourage local Government institutions composed of represen- tatives of the areas concerned and in such insti- tutions special representation shall be given, as far as possible, to peasants, workers and women.”  The substituted Article 9 is in respect of promo- tion of local Government institutions but Articles 11, 59 and 60 adequately provided for such institu- tions, as such, this substitution was unnecessary. The new provision, however important it may appear but cannot delete the basis of our Banglaee nationalism, contained in original Article 9, for which the people of Bangladesh fought for libera- tion and martyrs made their supreme sacrifices. The original Article 9 glorified our Bangalee Nation- hood, possibly for the first time in our history, in recognitig@n of such nation-hood, the Constitution emblemed it as one its basic structures but its dele- tion by a Proclamation Order constituted a betrayal 1o the freedom fighters and the three million martyrs and an insult to our Nation-hood.  ",
      "464. We fail to understand why Article 9 bad to be repealed completely and possibly in order to camouflage the repealed Article, it was substituted with a new one which has no nexus with Bangalee nationalism.  ",
      "463. Our history shows that their anxiety was not for nothing but was painfully correct because Proclamations Order No, | of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, deleted Article- 9 altogether, containing the basis of Bangali nation- alism. This portion of the Proclamation Order did                exactly what the Pakistani Military Janta wanted to do in Bangladesh in 1971 . The similarity of inten tions is so stark that it makes one tart with surprise  ",
      "462. In this historical context, the framers of the Constitution in their anxiety, specifically spelt out the basis of Bangalee nationalism in the Constitution so that there should not be any confu- sion about their entity as Bangalee. Because, they had apprehensions like Justice Davies that this country may not always ‘have wise nd human rulers auuWicked men, ambitious _of power, with, hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may till the places’  ",
      "461. This provision glorified our concept of Bangalee nationalism. The framers of the Constitution in their wisdom, thought it necessary to specifically spell out the basis of Bangalee national- ism in the Constitution itself. There may be many reasons for it. One reason may be that from time immorial, this part of the world which is known as Bengal during British regime was continuously invaded by Shok, Hun, Pathans, Moguls and lastly by the English. As such, the Bangalees although retained their entity through their literature and cul- tural heritage but always governed by the people other than Bangalees. That is one of the reasons, Bengal voted so much in favour Muslim League in 1946 election on the Pakistan issue but even after independence from British yoke, in no time, their enthusiasm got a jolt when Mr Jinnah declared at Dhaka in 1948 that Urdu would be the only state- language of Pakistan. This was followed by a long history of conspiracies to cripple the majority East Pakistan economically, politically and also to destroy their cultural heritage and above all their pride the Bangalee Nationalism but instead, with the rise of oppression, Bangali nationalism got new exu- berance. The Pakistani Military Janta instead of sct- tling the issues politically unleashed the worst geno- cide in the history of mankind. One of their prime objectives was to destroy and sweep away our Bangalee nationalism from root, once for all and make the Bangalees a hundred percent Pakistani. In order to achieve such an ill-advised end they did not only hesitate to kill millions of innocent Bangalees and plunder: their belongings but also did their best to change their identity as Bangalee.  ",
      "460. This concept of Bangalee nationalism was further expounded and explained in the original Article 9 of our Constitution. The original Article 9 reads as follows: <br> The English Text is : <br> “9 The unity and solidarity of the Bangalee nation, which, deriving its identity from its language and culture, attained sover- eign and independent Bangladesh through a united determined struggle in the war of inde- pendence, shall be the basis of Bangalee nation-  alism.”  ",
      "459. Since this unwanted change of identity from ‘Bangalee’ to ‘Bangladeshi’ does not commen- surate with our national entity, this amendment goes to the root of our Bangalee nationalism.  ",
      "458. The inhabitants of this part of the world irrespective of their cast, creed and religion were known as Bangalees from time immemorial. In their lighter moments they laugh as a Bangalee, in their despair they cry as a Bangalee, they record their feelings in Bangla, their history, their philosophy. their culture, their literature are all in Bangla. These finer features of life and intellects gave them an identity as a race in India for more than thousand years. This was so recorded in the memoirs of Hiuen Tsang, Ibn Batuta and many other travellers. Even during the reign of Emperor Akbar, this part of his empire was known as ‘Sube Bangla’. As such, this identity as a Bangalee was not a mere illusion or frivolous idiosyncrasy but has a definite character which separated them from other races in Pakistan. The identity of Punjabees, Pathans etc might have faded away in their new identity as Pakistanees but the Bangalees consciously kept their separate entily in their culture and literature inspite of their                Pakistani citizenship. This was their pride. Their such entity as Bangalee blooms in their weal and woe. This sentiment may not have strict legal value but this very sentiment of Bangalee nationalism paved the way to the ultimate independent Bangla- desh which has a very definite legal existence. As such, nobody, how high so ever, must not ignore or under-value the words ‘Bangla’ or ‘Bangalee’ hecause since 1952, beginning with the martyrs of language movement, thousands of Bangalees gave their lives for their right not only to speak Bangla but also to live as such Bangalee. It is their basic right and very naturally, their Constitution recog- nised it.  ",
      "457. Next is Article 6 of the Constitution. declaring the citizenship of Bangladesh. The origi- nal Article 6 reads as follows: <br> The English text is: “6 . (1)Citizenship of Bangladesh shall be determined and regulated by law; <br> (2) The citizens of Bangladesh shall be known as Bangladeshis.” <br>  In this manner, the Bangalees, by 4 Procla- mation Order lost their identity as a Bangalee and over-night became Bangladeshi, due to the whims of an army commander.  ",
      "456. As such, from the discussions made above, it is very clear that the Proclamations Order No. | of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, destroyed the basis of our struggle for freedom and also changed the basic character of the Republic as enshrined in the Preamble as well as in Article 8(1) of the Constitution.  ",
      "455. Shahabuddin Ahmed, J in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury’ case evaluates Constitution in this manner at para-272, page-118 : <br> “On the one hand, it gives out-lines of the state apparatus, and aspirations of the people; it gives guarantees of fundamental rights of a cit- izen and also makes him aware of his solemn duty to himself, to his fellow citizen and to his country”.  No wonder his Lordship did not see any role of religion in the Constitution itself.  ",
      "453. Bangladesh came into being with the basic concepts of nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism. As such, its Constitution was framed with those ideals in view. It was never intended to be a theocratic State. Rather, it was one of the major reasons for the Bangalees for their cost- ly struggle for liberation.  454, In this connection it should be noted that the obligation of the State, in this respect, is to ensure that all persons in the Country can perform their respective religious functions. Besides, the State is to ensure that no discrimination is made between the followers of one religion over the other.  ",
      "452. According to Thomas Paine, the purpose of the Constitution is : <br> \"A Constitution is not the act of govern- ment, but of a people constituting a _govern- ment, and a government without a constitution is power without right......A constitution is a thing antecedent to a government; and a _gov- ernment is only the creature of a constitution.” (1792) (Quoted from Hilaire Barnett on Consti- tutional And administrative Law, Fourth Edi- tion, 2002, Page-7).  (The underlinings are mune)  According to O Hood Phillips, the purpose of the Constitution is : <br> “The Constitution of a State in the abstract sense is the system of laws, customs and con- ventions which define the composition and powers of organs of the state, and regulate the relations of the various state organs to one another and to the private citizen. A “Constitution” in the concrete sense is the doc- ument in which the most important laws of the                 constitution are authoritatively ordained.\" (Quoted from O. Hood Phillips’ Constitutional and Administrative Law, Seventh Edition, 1987, at page-5). (The underlinings are mine)  From the discussions made above on the con- cept of written Constitution it would appear that this instrument is predominantly for the purpose of reg- ulating the rights and obligations of the people vis- d-vis the State and vice versa but it has got nothing to do with the religious beliefs of its people.  ",
      "451. Such belief would reside with the people in accordance with their free will and shall never be interfered with, either by the State or any section of the population, however majority they may be. Such a secular concept would be inhibited in a modern democratic Constitution unless, of course, it is a theocratic State.  ",
      "450. In this connection it should be remem- bered that the purpose of a Constitution is not to describe the tenets of a particular religion but is an Instrument creating the high institutions of the Republic and its relationship with its people. A Constitution upholds and guarantees such dignity to the people of the Republic with its own rights and also its obligations to the Republic in a broader sense but the religion of a particular section or sec- tions of people shall neither required to be high- lighted nor be interfered with in an ideal and model democratic form of Republic. The Constitution of such a Republic would never contain or refer to a particular faith but would leave such faculties with the people themselves. Bangladesh was dreamt of as a secular country and came into being as a secular country, as such, its Constitution was framed on that ideal, but any change from such a basis would con- stitute a change of the basic structure of the Constitution.  ",
      "449. As such, the framers of the Constitution, from their earlier bitter experience during the Liberation War, gave effect to the above lofty ideals of our martyrs which were reflected in the Preamble and Article 8(1) and other provisions of our Constitution. Those are the basic structures of the Constitution which were changed on replacement of the provisions of the original Preamble and Article 8(1) by the Proclamation Order No. | of 1977 and Second Proclamation Order No. JV of 1978, but such replacements changed the secular character of the Republic of Bangladesh into a theocratic State,  ",
      "448. Of necessity and being forced, the unarmed simple minded Bangalees of the then East Pakistan took up arms and rose against the tyranny for their survival. After Liberation, such oppression and persecution on the Bangalee population was very much fresh in their minds. They were deter- mined to establish an independent sovereign nation based on the democratic principles of.equality and social justice where nobody will be discriminated on the ground of religion.  ",
      "447. But the high ideals of equality and fra- ternity so very gloriously enshrined in Islam could not spare the majority population of the erstwhile East Pakistan from total discrimination in all spheres of the State without any exception. The erst- while East Pakistan was treated as a colony of West Pakistan and when voice was raised praying for al least near equal treatment, steam roller of oppres- sion was perpetrated on the people of the Eastem wing. After a long 23 years, the first general election in Pakistan was held in 1970 with one of the objects, to frame a Constitution. The National Assembly was                scheduled to be convened at Dhaka on March 3, 1971, but General Yahya Khan, the President and CMLA postponed the Assembly, forcing the country into turmoil. Thereafter, on the night following March 25, 1971, General Yahya Khan and his mili- tary government unleashed the worst genocide in the history of mankind on the unarmed people of the erstwhile East Pakistan, and the ‘valiant’ armed forces of Pakistan brutally killed millions. The vast majority of the people of this part of the world are God-fearing Muslims but their religion could not even save the fellow Muslims from being persecut- ed, Killed and raped and their belongings being plun- dered and all ironically in the name of Islam.  ",
      "446. It may be noted that in pursuance to the Indian Independence Act, 1947 (Act 10 & 11 Geo. IV Ch.30), British-India was partitioned and India and Pakistan, emerged as two independ Dominions. It is true that partition was made, more or less on the basis of religion but India declared itself as a secular nation. Mr Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the first Governor General of Pakistan, although in his first speech made on September 11, 1947, hinted that in Pakistan people of all religion would be equal without any religious discrimination but its first Constitution, made in 1956, declared the country as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Constitution of 1962 made no difference. Pakistan, since the death of its first Governor General, reduced itself into a theoretic nation as happened in medieval Europe.  ",
      "445. In line with the change made in the sec- ond paragraph of the preamble, Article 8(1) was also changed. The original Article 8(1) reads as follows:  The English Text is : <br> “8.(1)The principles of nationalism, social- ism, democracy and secularism, together with the principles derived from them as set out in this Part, shall constitute the fundamental prin- ciples of state policy.”  The amended version reads as follows:  The English Text as amended is : <br> “8.(1)The principles of absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah. nationalism. democracy and socialism meaning economic and social justice. together with the principles derived from them as set out in this Part, shall constitute the fundamental principles of state policy.”  (1A) Absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions.”  ",
      "444. The original preamble clearly show that one of the four fundamental basis of our nation- hood wes secularism but the amended Preamble specially the second paragraph show that the word ‘secularism’ wes deleted from the preamble. Since ‘secularism’ is one of fundamental basis of our Liberation War and the nation-hood of Bangladesh, its omission changed the basic character of the Constimition.  ",
      "443. A plain reading comparing the original Preamble with the amended one would un-mistak- ably show certain basic changes were made by the above Order.  ",
      "442. The original second paragraph of the Preamble reads as follows:  The English Text is : <br> “Pledging that the high ideals of national- ism, socialism, democracy and secularism, which inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves to, and our brave martyrs to sacri- fice their lives in, the National Liberation strug- gle, shall be the fundamental principles of the Constitution;”  But after amendment by The Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978), as inserted in the 2nd Schedule, it reads :  The English Text is : <br> “Pledging that the high deals of obsolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah, national- ism, democracy and socialism meaning eco- nomic and social justice, which inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves to, and our                          brave martyrs to sacrifice their hives in, the war for national independence, shall be the funda- mental principles of the Constitution”  The above amendment was inserted by the Proclamations (Amendment Onder, 1977 (Proclama- tions Order No. 1 of 1977).  ",
      "441. In the first paragraph of the Preamble in the original Constitution the words ‘a historic war for national independence’ were substituted for the original words ‘a historic struggle for national liber- ation’, The second paragraph of the preamble was entirely substituted for the second paragraph con- tained in the original Constitution.  ",
      "439. The words, commas and brackets ‘BIS- MILLAH-AR-RAHMAN-AR-RAHIM (In_ the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful) were inserted before the word ‘PREAMBLE’ by the above Order.  440.’ The Constitution, however, starts with the Preamble. This was also noticed by the Appellate Division in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case at para-48 (BLD).  ",
      "438. The English text of the changes of the various provisions of the Constitution were made by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) while the Bengali versions of those very changes and few oth- ers were made by the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978).  ",
      "437. We shall now deal with the provisions of the Constitution which were replaced by the new ones in pursuance of those Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. It is necessary to discuss those provi- sions of the Constitution with purported amend- ments because those were also ratified and validated by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979. This is also required in order to understand the legality of the provisions sought to be ratified by the said Fifth Amendment.  ",
      "435. But the Second Parliament validated those void and non-est provisions including the Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation, 1977 (Martial Law Regulation No. Vil of 1977), by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act | of 1979). As such, we have to con- sider the legality not only of Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 but the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977, (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) and also the vires of the aforesaid Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, which                  purported to ratify and confirm those Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs including the MLR VII of 1977. <br> Part XXIV Amendments in the Constitution <br> But by the Proclamation dated August 20, 1975, the Constitution although was retained but it was made subordinate and subservient to the Proclamations, the MLRs and MLOs. We have already held above that those Proclamations, the MLRs and the MLOs are void and non-est in the eye of law.  ",
      "434. Since our Apex Court in a number of cases as discussed above found as a fact that the Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations and Orders issued from time to time since August 20, 1975, till April, 1979, made the Constitution of Bangladesh subordinate and subservient to those Proclamations. MLRs and MLOs, are void ab initio and non est in the eye of law.  ",
      "433. Before we conclude our discussions on the supremacy of the Constitution we would like to quote from the treatise; ‘American Jurisprudence’ second Edition (1998) Vol 16 published by West Group, USA at pages: 344 to 349: <br> “1 . Definition and nature of “constitu- tion” and “constitutional law,” generally <br> 5 . Generally The United States is a constitutional democracy. The constitutional form of govern- ment as it exists in the United States is based on the fundamental conception of a supreme law, expressed in written form,’ in accordance with which all private rights must be determined and all public authority administered.  Constitutional government by the people represents the greatest and grandest struggles of humanity for its betterment, and in its accom- plishment marks the uttermost political accom- plishment of the human race, The limitations imposed by the American system of constitu- tional law on the action of the governments, both state and national, are deemed to be essen- tial to the preservation of public and private rights, notwithstanding the representative char- acter of our political institutions. In the United States, the right of sovereignty is vested in the people and is exercised through the joint action of the federal and state governments.  From the above rather lengthy discussions it is firmly and undeniably established that: <br> (i) The Constitution is the supreme law in Bangladesh; (ii)All great Institutions of the Republic, namely the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary are the creations of the Constitution; <br> (iii) All functionaries of the Republic are the the creatures of the Constitution; <br> (iv)The services of the Republic including the defence services are the creatures of the Constitution; <br> (v) As such, all the Institutions, functionaries and the services of the Republic, owe its existence to the Constitution and whol- ly and fully bound by its edicts.  <br> (vi)The existence of the country as a Republic is dependent on its Constitution.   Nobody can deny the above incidents of supremacy of the Constitution.  ",
      "432. Shahabuddin Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was), also in the Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case upheld the supremacy of the Constitution in the following manner at para-272 page-118 ;  “In this case we are to interpret a Constitution which is referred to as the will of the people and supreme law of the land and as such it is a most important instrument. But its                  pre eminence is not derived only from the fact that it is the supreme law of the land. it is pre- eminent because it contains lofty principles and is based on much higher values of human life. On the one hand, it gives out-lines of the State appa- ratus, on the other hand, it enshrines long cher- ished hopes and aspirations of the people; it gives guarantees of fundamental rights of a citizen and also makes him aware of his solemn duty to him- self, to his fellow citizen and to his country.\"  This is how our Apex Court upholds and acclaims the supremacy of the Constitution and we are bound to follow it.  ",
      "182. ECS Wade and G Godfrey Phillips in Constitutional and Administrative Law consid- ered the question of the doctrine of legislative supremacy. The authors pointed out that the doctrine of legislative supremacy distinguishes the United Kingdom from those countries in which a written constitution imposes limits upon the legislature and entrusts the ordinary courts whether the acts of the Legislature are in accordance with the Constitution. It is observed: <br> “In a constitutional system which accepts judicial review of legislation, legislation may be held invalid on a variety of grounds: for example. because it conflicts with the separa- tion of powers where this is a feature of the Constitution, (Liyanage vs R [1967] AC 259) or infringe human rights guaranteed by the Constitution, (EG Aptheker vs Secretary of State 378 US 500 (1964) (Act of US Congress refusing passports to Communists held a unconstitutional restriction on right to travel) or has not been passed in accordance with the pro- cedure laid down in the Constitution (Harris vs Minister of Interior 1 952(2) SA 428).  ",
      "431. His Lordship again held that our Constitution is a written constitution and that again a rigid one. In upholding the supremacy of the Constitution his Lordship quoted with approval the following at para-]81-182 page-92-93 : <br> “181 . KC Wheare says: “Constitutional Government_means something more than Government according to terms of a Constitution. It means Government_according to rule as opposed to arbitrary Government, it means Government limited by terms of a Constitution not Government limited only by the desire and capacity of those who exercise powers”. He says there might be country with Constitution and the Constitution does more than establish institutions of government and left them act as they wish. He observed: <br> “In such a case we would hardly call the Government Constitutional Government. The real justification of Constitutions, the original idea behind them is that of limiting Government and of requiring those who govern to conform to the law and usage. Most Constitutions as we have been seen do purport to limit the Gvernment “and_if_in turn a constitution imposes restriction upon the powers of the insti- tution it must _be said” then the courts must decide whether _their actions transgress those restrictions and in doing so, the Judge must say what the Constitution means.”  Professor Wheare was quoted further;  “The substance of the matter is that while it is the duty of every institution established under the authority of a Constitution and exercising powers granted by Constitution, to keep within the limits of those words, it is the duty of the Court from the nature of their function to say what these limits are? and that is why courts come to interpret a Constitution”. (Page 174, Modern Constitution).  ",
      "148. Professor Wheare further mentioned that once a Constitution is enacted, even when it has been submitted to the people for approval, it binds thereafter not only the institutions which it establishes, but also the people itself: They may amend the Constitution, if at all, only by methods which the Constitution itself provides (Page 89- 90). He further says “A Constitution cannot be disobeyed with the same degree of lightearted- ness as a Dog Act. It lies at the basis of political order: if it is brought into contempt, disorder and chaos may soon follow” ( P 91).  This nation has learnt its bitter lessons to the consequence of disobedience of the Constitution.  (The underlinings are mine).                 We have already seen above how Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc, the three usurpers treated our Constitution. This Constitution was writ- ten on the blood, toil and tears of millions of Bangalees but this was treated not even as one ‘Dog Act’ or “Rat Act’, they treated it most disgracefully although all of them took oath to ‘preserve, protect and defend’ the said very Constitution but even a plane ticket gets more attention and care from a chance traveller to Bangladesh than what Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed etc. did to our Constitution.  ",
      "147. Professor KC Wheare in Modern Constitutions quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist when he said:  There is no position which depends on clearer principles than that every act of a dele- gated authority, contrary to the tenor of the Commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm that the de is greater than his prin- cipal: that the servant is above his master, that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid. And he con- cludes that “the Constitution ought to_be_pre- ferred to the Statute, the intention of their agents”  ",
      "146. Professor Baxi while talking about Indian Constitution said that the Supreme Court reiterated that what is supreme is the Constitution \"neither Parliament nor the judici- ary is by itself supreme. The amending power is but a power given by the Constitution to Parliament; it is a higher power than any other given to Parliament but nevertheless it is a power within and not outside of. the Constitution .... Article 368 is one part of the Constitution. It is not and cannot be the whole of Constitution\". (See Indian Constitution Trends and Issues at Page- 123). ",
      "430. Regarding supremacy of the Constitution and its amendment his Lordship further held at para- 145-148, page-83-86 <br> “145 . Jt does not need citation of any authority that the power to frame a Constitution is a primary power whereas a power to amend a rigid constitution is a derivative power derived from the Constitution and subject at least to the limitations imposed by the prescribed proce- dure. Secondly, laws made under a rigid consti- tution, as also the amendment of such a consti- tution can be ultra vires if they contravene the limitations put on the law making or amending power by the Constitution, for the Constitution is the touch stone of validity of the exercise of the powers conferred by it. But no provision of the Constitution can be ultra vires because there is no touch stone outside the Constitution by which the validity of a provision of the Constitution can be judged. (See MH-Seervai, Constitutional Law of India at page-(1522-23),  ",
      "429. It will be apparent that from the very beginning the framers of the Constitution dreamt of a democratic form of Government, not a Martial Law Government or a dictatorship or an autocratic form of Government. B.H.Chowdhury, J, held at para-47 Page-58: <br> “It will be noticed that the proclama took notice of the “Mandate” for framing a Constitution for the Republic so as to ensure “equality, human dignity and social justice” and a democratic form of Government.”  ",
      "428. It may be recalled that on the night fol- lowing March 25, 1971, independence of Bangladesh was proclaimed. It was followed by a formal Proclamation of Independence. It was issued o April 10, 1971, from Mujibnagar. It reads as fol- lows: <br>               THE PROCLAMATION OF INDEPENDENCE Mujibnagar, Bangladesh Dated 10th day of April, 1971 <br> WHEREAS free elections were held in Bangladesh from 7th December, 1970 to 17th January, 1971, to elect representatives for the purpose of framing a Constitution,  AND  WHEREAS at these elections the people of Bangladesh elected 167 out of 169 representa- tives belonging to the Awami League,  AND  Whereas General Yahya Khan summoned the elected representatives of the people to meet on the 3rd March, 1971, for the purpose of framing a Constitution,  AND  WHEREAS the assembly so summoned was  arbitarily and illegally postponed for an indefi- nite period.  AND Whereas instead of fulfilling their promise and while still conferring with the representa- tives of the people of Bangladesh, Pakistan authorities declared an unjust and treacherous war, <br> AND  Whereas in the facts and circumstances of such treacherous conduct Banga Bandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the undisputed leader of 75 million of people of Bangladesh, in due fulfill- ment of the legitimate right of self-determina- tion of the people of Bangladesh, duly made a declaration of independence at Dacca on March 26, 1971, and urged the people of Bangladesh to defend the honour and integrity of Bangladesh, <br> AND  WHEREAS in the conduct of a ruthless and savage war the Pakistani authorities committed and are still continuously committing numerous acts of genocide and unprecedented tortures, amongst others on the civilian and unarmed people of Bangladesh,  <br> AND  Whereas the Pakistan Government by levy- ing an unjust war and committing genocide and by other repressive measures made it impossible for the elected representatives of the people of Bangladesh to meet and frame a Constitution, and Give to themselves a Government, <br> AND  Whereas the people of Bangladesh by their heroism, bravery and revolutionary fervour have established effective control over the terri- tories of Bangladesh,  In respect of the above Proclamation BH Chowdhury, J (as his Lordship then was) held in the case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury etc vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD(spl) 1 at para-43 page-57: “This declaration envisages the following: <br> (a) Because of the unjust war and genocide by the Pakistani authorities it became “impossi- ble for the elected representatives of the people of Bangladesh to meet and frame a Constitution” although General Yahya Khan summoned the elected representatives earlier “to meet on the 3rd March, 1971 for the purpose of framing a Constitution”; <br> (b) The elected representatives duly consti- tute them self into a Constituent Assembly because of the “mandate given to us by the peo- ple of Bangladesh whose will is supreme” <br> (c) It declared Bangladesh to be sovereign people’s Republic in order to ensure “equality, human dignity and social justice. <br> (d) Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was declared to be President and Syed Nazrul Islam Vice-President “till such time as a Constitution is framed”; <br>               (e) President or in his absence the Vice- President “shall have the power to appoint a Prime Minister and such other Ministers as he considers necessary”. It was the presidential system that was envisaged; <br> (f) President or in his absence the Vice- President “shall have the power to summon and adjourn the Constituent Assembly.”  ",
      "427. We have already quoted the Proclama- tions and some of the MLRs and MLOs above in the beginning of our present discourse. We have analysed the findings of our Apex Court made in the cases of Halima Khatun, Haji Joynal Abedin. Ehteshamuddin Ahmed, Nasiruddin and Anwar Hossain Chowdhury. From the analysis of Procla- mations, MLRs and MLOs scrutinised above and the findings of our Apex Court as stated above, it is crystal clear that the Constitution was made subor- dinate and subservient to the Proclamations dated August 20, 1975, November 8, 1975 and November 29, 1976 and the MLRs and MLOs made thereun- der, as such, ultra vires to the Constitution. There is no provision which is ‘Supra Constitutional’ or to put it mildly, ‘Extra Constitutional’. All laws or pro- visions and actions taken thereon must without any exception, conform to the Constitution. Any law or provision which is beyond the ambit of the Constitution, is ultra vires and void, as such, non-est in the eye of law. The doubtless supremacy of the Constitution is far above all Institutions, Functionaries and services it created.   ",
      "426. It is to be noted that amongst the three pillars of the Republic it is the Supreme Court which is privileged to declare the Majesticity of the Constitution and in having such a privilege, it is not the Constitution rather it is the Supreme Court which is honoured. The Constitution 1s supreme not because it is written on parchment papers but because it is the embodiment of the will of the peo- ple of the Republic. The Constitution of Bangladesh was born with such supremacy since it was adopted and enacted on November 4, A972 . The Supreme Court only declares its such existing supremacy.  ",
      "425. One may say that this is not Bible. Of course, it is not Bible. While the Bible has got uni- versal application and governs the mode of life of all persons in the World holding Christian faith, the Constitution governs the life of all persons within the Republic irrespective of caste, creed, religion and applies to persons of all faiths and even to athe- ists.  ",
      "424. The Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh declares its own supremacy in the above manner. It does not need any aid from any of the Institutions it created to declare its such eminence. It remains sublime for all time to come.  ",
      "423. Keeping in view these saga of unfortu- nate national hara kiri, we have to examine our Constitution, the most sacred document in any coun- try.  ",
      "422. We, however, neither approve nor accept such 2 base treatment of our Constitution, the Supreme law of the land.  ",
      "421. They are all intelligent people. They knew very well that the Proclamations ete. are al illegal and so also their activities. As such, they again came round and sought to hide all their ille- galities in the bosom of the said very Constitution which they disgraced time and again in their free wills, whims and caprices. In their such pursuits, ironically, there was no dearth of hypocrisy in that although the Dictators freely truncate and modify the various provisions of the Constitution all the time to suit their ends but when those very illegal Proclamations etc. become part of our sacred Constitution, those become unchallengable, as argued by the learned Advocates for the respon- dents.  ",
      "420. There is no existence of Martial Law Authorities or the Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations or Orders in our Constitution or any of the laws of the land. Those authorities or the Proclamation etc. are quite foreign to our jurispru- dence. Still those Proclamations etc. were imposed on the people of Bangladesh. Those have got no legal basis. Those are illegal and imposed by force. The people are constrained to accept it for the time being, not out of attraction or its legality but out of fear, As such, it has got no legal acceptance, The Martial Law Authorities were also fully aware of it, as such, some times, they hold a referendum for one person and they invariably get almost cent percent votes, as in the cases of Field Marshal Ayub Khan and Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc. The Martial Law Authorities some times abrogate the Constitution, as in the case of the abrogation of 1956 Constitution by Major General Iskender Mirza, President of Pakistan, and 1962 Constitution by General Yahya Khan, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan, Some times, the                Constitution is suspended and made subservient to the Proclamations etc. as in the case Proclamations by Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Muhammad Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc.  ",
      "419. In the same manner, the Prime Minister and other Ministers, The Chief Adviser, The Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Chief Justice and other Judges of the Supreme Court, pledge to ‘pre- serve, protect and defend the Constitution’.  ",
      "418. Under this provision of the Constitution the President of the Republic is required to take an oath or affirmation as stated in the Third Schedule in  the following manner :  English Text is as follows :  1 . The President.—An oath (of affirmation) in the following form shall be administered by the ‘(Chief Justice]- <br> I ............................... , do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of President of Bangladesh accord- ing to law:  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to Bangladesh:  That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution:  And that I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.”  (The underlinings are mine)  In his oath or affirmation, the President of Bangladesh pledges that he will ‘preserve, protect and defend the Constitution’.  ",
      "417. But the Constitution is supreme, The Constitution itself proclaims so. The Supreme Court said so in the AT Mridha’s case and also in the case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury etc vs Bangladesh,  First the Constitution. In paragraph-4 of the Preamble it is emphatically Proclaimed :  The English Text is : <br> “Affirming that it is our sacred duty to safeguard, protect and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodi- ment of the will of the people of Bangladesh so that we may prosper in freedom and may make our full contribution towards international peace and co-operation in keeping with the pro- gressive aspirations of mankind.\" (The underlinings are mine)  Article 1, Article 7 and Article 21(1) of the Constitution, affirms the supremacy of the Constitution.  After the Preamble, the Constitution com- mences in this manner with Article 1 :  Part I THE REPUBLIC <br> 1 . Bangladesh is a unitary, independent, sovereign Republic to be known as the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.  Article 7 reads as follows :  The English Text is : <br> “7 . (1) All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the                 people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution, <br> (3) This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other Jaw shall, to the extent of the inconsisten- cy, be void.”  Article 21(1) reads as follows: <br> “21 . (1) It is the duty of every citizen to observe the Constitution and the laws, to main- tain discipline, to perform public duties and to protect public property.”  Besides, Article 148(1) Provides for making an oath or affirmation by the persons elected or appointed to an office mentioned in the Third Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "416. Similar question had also been faced by Hamoodur Rahman, CJ in the case of Asma Jilani vs                Government of Punjab PLD 1972 SC 139, This is how his Lordship dealt with the problem at page- 202-03 : <br> “The learned Attomey-General however, insists that even this regime had received the legal recognition of this Court and, therefore, It had also acquired de jure authority to make laws. Reference in this connection has been made to two decisions, The first was in the case of Muhammad Ismail vs State (1) in which the judgment was delivered again by myself. The only question raised in this case was as to whether after the promulgation of Martial Law on the 25th of March 1969, and the enactment of the Provisional Constitution Order on the 4th of April 1969, this Court continued to retain the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Constitu- tion of 1962 to entertain petitions for special leave to appeal in criminal proceedings in view of the fact that the Provisional Constitution Order did not specifically provide for any appeal by special leave. No question was raised in this case as to the validity of the Martial Law or of the Provisional Constitution Order. The only question argued was whether on a proper construction of the language of this order an appeal for special leave in criminal proceedings was still within the competence of this Court. The Court held that upon a proper construction of the terms of the Order the Jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals by special leave in criminal matters had not been taken away and that the jurisdiction given to it by Article 58 of the 1962-Constitution remained unaffected. There was no question, therefore, of any con- scious application of the mind of the Court to the question of the validity of the regime or the legality of the Provisional Constitution Order nor was this Court called upon to give any deci- sion thereon as the latter order had manifested no intention to alter that jurisdiction and there was no conflict between the two. It is not cor- rect, therefore, to say that this decision in any way constitutes a conscious recognition in law of the new regime. The next case referred to is that of Mian Fazal Ahmad vs State (2). In this case, which was a petition for special leave from an order of the Lahore High Court dismissing an applica- tion under section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashment of certain criminal proceedings pending investigation by the police;_the High Court had admitted the any challan in any Court. The police did not do so but instead of submitting a challan before a Criminal Court placed the matter before a Military Court and the latter convicted the peti- tioner. Thereupon the petitioner moved the High Court, for taking action against the DSP in contempt for disobedience of its order. The High Court dismissed the application of the petitioner and this Court by a very brief order dismissed the petition for special leave observ- _ ing that “when the Military Court took cog- nizance of the offence and imposed a penalty on the petitioner learned Judge in the High Court was right in dismissing the petitioner’s applica- tion under section 56l-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure” No other reason was given for the order.  Again, this does not show that the legality of the order of transfer of the case to the Military Court was over challenged, The High Court’s order was upheld possibly on the ground that the proceedings which were sought to be quashed by the original petition having . been terminated by the transfer of the case to the Military Court, there was no further need of its quashment, and no question of commitment of the DSP in contempt arose, as he had not vio- lated the order of the High Court. In these cir- cumstances, it can hardly be urged that this con- stitutes a conscious legal recognition of the mil- itary regime of 1969 . Questions in dispute in these cases were it entirely different and had nothing whatever to do with the question now before us. It is incorrect, therefore, to say that this Court had given any legal recognition to the                regime of General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan,  The question, therefore, is still at large and has for the first time now been raised before this Court in this specific form. The learned Attorney-General's contention that even the tacit approval given by this Court by not ques tioning suo motu the various Martial Law Regulations made by the regime concemed dur- ing this period of 2 1/2 years is it self sufficient to preclude this Court from going into this ques- tion now, is not in my opinion, tenable. The Courts, as I have already indicated are not called upon to suo motu raise a controversy and then decide it, They can only do so if a litigant  raises the controversy in a concrete form, as it has now been done before us. “The Court”, says Mr Eaton Drome, “has authority to expound the Constitution only in cases presented to it for adjudication. Its Judges may see the President usurping powers that do not belong him, Congress exercising functions it is forbidden to exercise, a State asserting rights denied to it. The Court has no authority to interfere until its office is invoked in a case submitted to it in the manner prescribed by law.” (Vide Marriot English Political Institutions, 1938 Edn, P, 293).  We have seen from the opinions of our Apex Court given in the cases of Halima Khatun, Haji Joynal Abedin, Kh. Ehteshamuddin, Nasiruddin and Anwar Hossain Chowdhury that the Martial Law Proclamations etc, made the Constitution a bunch of worthless sheaf of papers.  ",
      "415. In Nasiruddin’s case, the issue was whether the writ abated, in view of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 read with paragraph 4 of Martial Law Regulation No, VII of 1977 . This case has got no nexus with the Fifth Amendment.   ",
      "414. Besides, at paragraph 25 of the Judgment it is categorically stated that neither the authority of the person who proclaimed Martial Law nor the vires of the Martial Law Regulations was chal- lenged in the said case. °  ",
      "413. It is not, since the vires of the Fifth Amendment was not under challenge in any of those two appeals,even indirectly. The issues involved in those two cases were no where near the Fifth Amendment.  In Ehteshamuddin s case the issues were : <br> (i) Whether the proceedings of the Special Martial Law Court could be examined after the enactment of the Fifth Amendment and the Proclamation made on April, 7; 1979 by the CMLA, withdrawing the Martial Law and revoking the earlier Proclamations. <br> (ii) The extent of protection given under the Fifth Amendment. (iii) Whether — the decision of the Government can be called in question under Article 102 of the Constitution despite the Proclamation of April 6, 1979.  It is apparent that the vires of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution was not under chal- lenge in any of the above cases. This is also admit- ted by the learned Additional Attomey-General and also the learned Advocate for the respondent No. 3.  ",
      "412. A question although was not raised but yet may arise that since those two cases were decid- ed after the enactment of the Fifth Amendment whether it can be said that the Appellate Division approved the FiNh Amendment, at least impliedly.  ",
      "411. In Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case, the Appellate Division found :  The Constitution was retained as a statute subordinate to the Martial Law Proclamations, Orders and Regulations.  In this connection it should be noted that the case of Kh Ehteshamnddin Ahmed vs Bangladesh 33 DLR (AD) 154 was decided on 27-3-1980 and the case of Nasiruddin vs Government of Bangladesh 32 DLR (AD) 216 was decided on 14-4-1980 . Both the cases were decided after the Fifth Amendment was passed on April 6, 1979, by the Second Parliament.  ",
      "410. In Haji Joynal Abedin’ case, the Appel- late Division found; <br> (i) The Constitution was reduced to a posi- tion subordinate to the Proclamation, <br> (ii) The unamended unsuspended Constitu- tional provisions were allowed to con- tinue subject to the Proclamations and MLRs and MLOs, <br>               (iii) The Constitution was amended from time to time by issuing Proclamations. <br> (iv) The moment the country is put under Martial Law, the Constitution looses its superior position. <br> In Ehteshamuddin’s case, the Appellate Division found : <br> (i) The Constitution continued subject to the Proclamations. <br> (ii)The Supremacy ‘of the Constitution cannot by any means compete with the Proclamation. <br> (iii)The Chief Martial Law Administrator would not be deemed to be a person holding an office of profit in the serv- ice of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. <br> (iv)The High Court lost its superior power to issue writ against the Martial Law Authority or Martial Law Courts. <br> In Nasiruddin’s case, the Appellate Division found that the expression ‘purported exercise’ in the validating clause of Fifth Amendment cannot give protection of an act, which is coram non judice, from being challenged.  ",
      "409. In the case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury etc. vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD (Spl) 1, Shahabuddin Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was), considered the Constitution during Martial Law in this manner at para-272, page-118: <br> “Bangladesh which got Independence from Pakistan through a costly War of independence, which was fought with the avowed declaration to establish a democratic polity under a highly democratic Constitution met the same fate as Pakistan. Two Martial Laws covered a period of 9 years Out of her 18 years of existence. During these Martial Law periods the Constitution was not abrogated but was either suspended or retained as a statue subordinate to the Martial Law Proclamations. Orders and Regulation.\"  Let us now examine the findings of our Apex Court in respect of the Proclamations, the Martial Law and our Constitution.  It was held in the Halima Khatun’s case: <br> (i) Under the Proclamations, the Constitution lost its character as the supreme law of the Republic. <br> (ii)The Constitution is subordinate to the Proclamations and the Regulations and Orders made thereunder. <br> (iii) Constitution is superior to any law other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation. <br> ",
      "408. The next is the case of Nasiruddin vs Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh 32 DLR (AD) 216 . This case was decided on 14-4- 1980 . It is also in respect of an abandoned property. It modified the effect of the decision of the earlier Halima Khatun s case to some extent but the obser- vations of Fazle Munim, J, in respect of the status of Martial Law vis-a-vis the Constitution made in the said decision, remained unaltered. Kemaluddin Hossain, CJ, however, held at para-10, page 221: <br> “It is to be observed that when an authori- ty is vested with a jurisdiction to do certain acts and in the exercise of that jurisdiction he does it wrongly or irregularly the action can be said to be done within the purported exercise of his jurisdiction. But an act which is manifestly without jurisdiction, such as the property which not being an abandoned property within the meaning of Presidential Order 16 of 1972 is declared to be so, or in case of judicial or quasi judicial act which is coram non judice, the use of the expression ‘purported exercise’ in the validating clause of fifth amendment of the Constitution cannot give such act the protection from challenge, it being ultra vires, It is true mala fide act is also not protected, but then mala fide is to be pleaded with particulars constitut- ing such mala fide and established by cogent materials before the Court.”  That very question is before us for considera- tion as to whether Fifth Amendment can give pro- tection from challenge the actions of Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc., none of whom were qualified to become the President under the Constitution,  ",
      "407. It is apparent from the above Judgement that the effect of the proclamation was that the Constitution is supreme only when the Martial Law is not near by and even long after the lifting of the Martial Law, on the face of its bare shadow, the Constitution with its 'supremacy' becomes a worth-   less sheaf of papers. Whether we like it or not the status of the Constitution was reduced to such an ignoble shambles by the Proclamations, the MLRs and the MLOs which would have blushed even Henry VIII or Louis XIV. During the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th Century, the Proclamations were issued by the King but in pursuance of an Act of Parliament and no prerogative right to issue procla- mation was allowed even to the King of England by the Chief Justice Coke four hundred years ago in 1610.  ",
      "18. In that case. on the question of High Court's power under the Constitution to issue writ against the Martial Law Authority or Martial Law Courts, this Division has given the answer that the High Courts, being creature under the Constitution with the Proclamation of  Martial Law and the Constitution allowed to remain operative subject to the Proclamation and Martial Law Regulation, it losess its supe- rior power to issue Writ against the Martial Law Authority or Martial Law Courts .... \" <br> His Lordship further held at para-25 page-166: \"25 . Before I proceed further it may be mentioned that in the present case neither the  authority  of the person who proclaimed Martial Law nor the vires of the Martial Law Regulation was or could be challenged at the  bar excepting arguing on the question of supremacy of the Constitution over the Proclamations and Martial Law Regulations. Since the authority of the Chief Martial Law Administrator is not challenged and the vires of the relevent Martial Law Regulation is also not challenged. I do not find any good reason for making reference to Asma Jilani's case ...... \" (The underlinings are mine)  From the above Judgement it is apparent that even after lifting of the Martial Law, its provisions remained supreme and on the face of the MLRs, the Constitution was relegated even further to the back- seat. Although at that time the Martial Law was not there but even then the Constitution was real sub- ject to the Martial Law and was made to recoil on the face of the bare shadow of the MLRs.  ",
      "406. In considering Ehteshamuddin's Case his Lordship held at Para - 18 page - 163 : <br> \"",
      "405. At that time although Martial Law was withdrawn still its dark shadows apparently loomed large over the country and its Constitution, as found by the Court. His Lordship Ruhul Islam. J, in con- sidering Article-7, help at pera-16 page-163: <br> \" It is true that Article 7(2) declares the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Republic and if any other law is inconsistent with the Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void, but the supremacy of the Constitution cannot by any means compete with the Proclamation issued by the Chief Martial Law.... \" (The underlinlings are mine)  ",
      "404. In this case, the vires of the Fifth Amend- ment was not challenged. This position was admit- ted by the learned Advocates of both the sides, the Court considered the legality of the proceedings before the Special Martial Law Court when the country was under Martial Law Court. The Judgement of the Appellate Division was given on March 27, 1980.  ",
      "403. Leave was granted, inter alia, to consider  as to whether the proceeding of the Special Martial Law Court could be examined by the High Court Division after passing of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.  ",
      "402. By this time, Proclamations were revoked and the Martial Law was withdrawn.  ",
      "401. The next is the case of Kh. Ehtesham- uddin Ahmed vs Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) 154 . In this case a writ petition was filed challenging the proceedings in passing the Judgment and Order of conviction passed by the Special Martial Law Court. The Proclamation etc. were not challenged. The High Court Division summarily rejected the writ petition by an order dated June, 13, 1979, on the ground of ouster of jurisdiction by MLR 1 of 1975.  ",
      "400. This opinion of the Appellate Division  was given on Decembers 20, 1978 . At that time the  country was under Martial Law.  ",
      "399. After tracing the history of the Proclamation of Martial Law, declared on August 20, 1975 at page-16 and 17 of the Report, Ruhul Islam, J, held para-18, page-122 : <br> “From a consideration of the features noted above it leaves no room for doubt that the Constitution though not abrogated, was reduced to a position subordinate to the Proclamation inasmuch as, the unamended and unsuspended constitutional provisions were kept in force and allowed to continue subject to the Procamation and Martial Law Regulation or orders and other orders; and the Constitution was amended from time to time by issuing Proclamation. In the face of the facts stated above I find it difficult to accept the arguments advanced in support of the view that the Constitution as such is still in force as the supreme law of the country, untrammelled by the Proclamation and Martial Law Regulation ........ \" His Lordship further held at para-19 : p-122-23 :  \" ...............  So long the Constitution is in force as the supreme law of the country, any act done or proceeding taken by a person purport- ing to function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority may be made the subject matter of review by High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, The moment the country is put under Martial Law, the above noted constitutional provision along with other civil laws of the country loses its superior position. \" (The underlinings are mine)  His Lordship very specifically spelt out that the Constitution was reduced to a position subordinate to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs.                ",
      "398. Leave was granted, infer alia, to consider as to whether in view of the Proclamation dated August 20, 1975, the High Court Division acted within its jurisdiction in issuing the writ.  ",
      "397. The second case is State vs Haji Joynal Abedin 32 DLR (AD) 110 . In this case a writ petition was filed challenging the legality of the order of conviction passed by the Special Martial Law Court. The legality of Proclamations etc. was not the issue in that case. The High Court Division declared the said order of conviction and sentence was without lawful authority and of no legal effect.  ",
      "396. This appeal was decided on January 4,1978 . Bangladesh was at that time under Martial Law. After considering the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and also the Constitution including Article 7, Fazle Munim, J (as his Lordship then was), observed at para-18 : <br> \" ....................... what appears from the Proclamation of August 20, 1975 is that with the declaration of Martial Law in Bangladesh on August 15, 1975, Mr Khondker Moshtaque Ahmed who became the President of Bangladesh assumed full powers of the                 Government and by Clause (d) and (e) of the Proclamation made the Constitution of Bangladesh, which was allowed to remain in force, subordinate to the Proclamation and any Regulation or order as may be made by the President in pursuance thereof. In Clause (h) the power to amend the Proclamation was pro- vided. It may be true that whenever there would be any conflict between the Constitution and the Proclamation or a Regulation or an Order the intention, as appears from the language employed, does not seem to concede such supe- riority to the Constitution. Under the Proclama- tion which contains the aforesaid clauses the Constitution has lost its character as the Supreme law of the country. There is no doubt, an express declaration in Article 7(2)of the Constitution to the following effect : “This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void.” Ironically enough, this Article, though still exists, must be taken to have lost some of its importance and efficacy. In view of clauses (d), (e) and (g) of the Proclamation the supremacy of the  Constitution as declared in that Article, no longer unqualified. In spite of this Article, no Constitutional provision can claim to be sacro- sanct and immutable. The present Constitutional provision may however, claim superiority to any law other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation.”  However unpalatable it may appear to us Fazle Munim, J, very crudely narrated that the Consti- tution of Bangladesh was made subservient and sub- ordinate to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs.  ",
      "395. The first is the case of Halima Khatun vs Bangladesh 30 DLR (SC) 207 . In the said case, the legality of the Proclamations etc. was not the issue but inclusion of a property in the list of abandoned properties was challenged in the High Court. The Rule was discharged on the ground that the question as to whether the relevant property was abandoned or not is a disputed question of fact. On appeal question arose before the Appellate Division, whether in view of the provisions of the Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation 1977, (MLR No. VII of 1977) the aforesaid writ petition abated.  ",
      "394. Now let us examine a few decisions of our Supreme Court where the status of the said Proclamations MLRs and, MLOs have been consid- ered.  ",
      "393. However, for our purpose, it is not that necessary either. We only wanted to see what kind of Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs were ratified con- firmed and validated by the Fifth Amendment. Because, the Second Parliament ratified confirmed ted all those Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution by insertion of paragraph 18 in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, without referring even to the headings of those Proclamations etc. not to speak of giving of details which were sought to be ratified but stated in an omnibus manner although every Bill ought to have spelt out with all and every details with dates of every provision which are going to be the part of the Constitution, the most sacred instru- ment a nation may have but it did not. It is alleged that this lapse alone was enough to declare it invalid. The legal aspect of this lapse we shall consider later.  ",
      "392. During the period from August 20, 1975 to April 9, 1979, hundreds of MLRs and MLOs were issued. Copies of only some of those are furnished by the learned Advocate for the petitioner. We have referred only to some of those Proclamation Orders, MLRs and MLOs above.  ",
      "391. But the proclamation of Martial Law is altocether a different matter. There was no law in Bangladesh which can allow the President or any- body on his behalf to declare martial law in Bangladesh, still, after the murder of the President by a section of army officers and men, Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, seized the office of President and declared Martial Law on August 20, 1975 . This Martial Law was continued by Justice Sayem, the next President, nominated on November 6, 1975 . He also assumed the office of CMLA. In due course, Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc, took over firstly as CMLA and thereafter, on April 21, 1977, as the next President again on nomination but he con- tinued as such CMLA till April 7, 1979.  ",
      "390. Although some of the fundamental rights may be suspended during the proclamation of emer gency but it is not the Proclamation of Martial Law. Besides, the proclamation of emergency must be approved by the Parliament within 120 days, other- wise it would automatically lapse. As a matter of fact, emergency was in existence since November, 1974 and continued till November, 1979.  ",
      "389. In case of a grave emergency in which the security or economic life of Bangladesh or any of its part is threatened by war or external aggres- sion or internal disturbance, the President may, with the advice of the Prime Minister, issue a proclama- tion of emergency. Such a proclamation, however, requires prior counter signature of the Prime Minister.  ",
      "388. Article 141A was not in the original Constitution. It was added by the Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1973 (Act XXIV of                1973). It provides for proclamation of emergency. It is still in the Constitution.  ",
      "387. The learned Advocates, however, submit- ted that the President had the power under Article 14]A to issue a proclamation of emergency and such an emergency was continuing at the relevant time.  ",
      "386. But we are not aware of any legislation allowing declaration of Martial Law by the President of Bangladesh, even under the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975 . The learned Advocates of both the sides could not show any legislation which could allow the President to apply Martial Law in the morning of August 15, 1975, even under the Fourth Amendment but that was done under the Proclamation,  ",
      "385. This was the position in the original Constitution of Bangladesh but the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975, made the office of the President executive Head of the Government. Although, since August 20, 1975, the Constitution was freely changed and badly mauled many a times but the position and status of the President was never changed rather, strengthened from time to time, obviously to suit the usurpers. However, by the Constitution (Twelfth Amendment) Act, 1991 (Act XXVIII of 1991), the present Parliamentary form of Government was again restored.  ",
      "384. In Bangladesh in contradistinction to US Constitution, although President is the head of the State and also the Supreme Commander of the defence services but he is not the executive head of the Government while the U.S. President is the executive head of the Republic and also the Commander-in-Chief of all the forces. This is one of the distinguishing features of the constitutional posi- tion of these two countries. Like US, Bangladesh has a rigid Constitution but unlike US, it has a par- liamentary form of government with the Prime Minister as its executive-head.  ",
      "383. The safe-guard exercised by the Congress in 1861 is still fully effective and opera- tive even now without slightest demur either from the President or from the defence forces or from any other quarter, rather, it appears that they would feel uneasy had it been otherwise. There neither the President nor the members of the Defence Forces feel themselves detached from the people, rather, it is engrossed in their minds that they belong to the people and above all they are the sons of the soil. This outlook highlights the democratic spirit of the people of the United States.  ",
      "382. Professor Edward S. Corwin, in his book, ‘The Constitution And What It Means To-day’ (Sixth Edition, 1938) considered the position in this manner at page-55-56 : <br> ................... In its measures for raising and supporting armies and for providing a navy, Congress may dictate the purposes for which these may be used. But so far as the statutes do not limit his discretion, and so long as he does not exceed the appropriations voted by Congress, the President may employ the armed forces of the United States as may seem to him best for the purpose of enforcing the laws of the United States and of protecting the rights under International Laws of American citizens abroad.  The limitation of appropriations for the army to two years reflects the American fear of standing armies.” (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "381. Although the Congress by legislation allows the President with necessary powers during war-time but the purse of the Republic always remains with the Congress. The relevant portion of Section 8 under Article 1 reads as follows : <br> “....But no appropriation of money to that use (raise and support armies) shall be for a longer term than two years;”  It appears that ultimate control remains with the Congress.  ",
      "380. In this connection, it should be noted that the President of the United States, an elected civil-                ian person being the Commander-in-Chief of all the defence forces, is the symbol of civilian authority and highlights the democratic principle of civilian supremacy.  ",
      "379. Same is the position in the United States. It is the Congress which is charged with the mainte- nance of the defence forces. But during the state of war the Congress by legislation may authorize the President to take appropriate actions including the proclamation of martial law. We have already dis- cussed above that even such Martial Law is not above the law but justiciable before the Court.  ",
      "378. In England with the Petition of Right, 1628, the power of the Crown to apply martial law in England was abolished. However, outside the United Kingdom in the colonies and even in Ireland martial law was applied during war, insurrection or rebellion. During the First and Second World Wars also martial law was applied. But even in all these war situations where civil authorities ceased to func- tion, Martial Law was applied with legislative sanc- tions only under the authority of the Crown. It should also be noted that the members of the defence services in the United Kingdom serve dur- ing the pleasure of the Crown.   ",
      "377. Under Rule 8 of the Army Rules, the Oath or Affirmation to be taken on attestation is in following form : <br> FORM OF OATH <br> I............. , swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful to Bangladesh and its constitu- tions and bear true allegiance to the President of Bangladesh that I will honestly and faithfully serve in the Bangladesh Army, that I will go wherever I may be ordered by land, air or sea, and that I will observe and obey all commands of any officer set over me even to the peril of my life. <br> FORM OF AFFIRMATION <br> I........................ , do solemnly affirm that I will be faithful to Bangladesh and its constitu- Bangladesh that I will honestly and faithfully serve in the Bangladesh Army. that I will observe and obey all commands of any officer set over me even to the peril of my life.  (Quoted from the book ‘A Manual of Defence Laws in Bangladesh’ Vol. Il. First Edition, 1976, edited by ATM Kamrul Islam).  Similar are the provisions in the Navy Ordinance, 1961 (XXXV of 1961) and the Air Force Act, 1953 (Act Vi of 1953) regarding appointment, terms and conditions of service and the disciplinary matters.  We have gone through the constitutional provi- sions with regard to the defence services and also the above noted provisions made for regulating the said services. We have also gone through Articles 48, 49, 55 and 56 but could not find any power enabling either the President or the Prime Minister to apply martial law in any part of Bangladesh.  ",
      "376. Section 15(1) provides for oath or affir- mation for 2 person who is to be attested. Sub-sec- tion 2 provides for the form of oath or affirmation which contains among others a promise that the per- son to be attested will be faithful to Bangladesh and its Constitution and bear true allegiance to the President of Bangladesh.  ",
      "375. The Army Act with Rules made thereun- der provides for appointment, enrolment and attesta- tion, terms and conditions of service, offences and various kinds of punishment, Courts Martial, sen- tences and its execution and other related and ancil- lary matters.  ",
      "374. The Pakistan Army Act, 1952, was enact- ed on May 13, 1952 and came into effect on April 1, 1952 . The Act has been extended to the whole of the erstwhile Pakistan by the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 (21 of 1960) with effect from October 14, 1955 . This Act repealed the Indian Army Act, 1911 among others. This Act has been accepted as the necessary legislation for Bangladesh Amny with the deletion of the word ‘Pakistan’ wher- ever appearing and with other amendments as and when found necessary.  ",
      "373. The Defence Services of Bangladesh includes the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Each of these services were created under the specific provisions of law, namely, The Army Act, 1952, The Air Force Act, 1953 and The Navy Ordinance, 1961. Those laws were in existence when Independence of Bangladesh was proclaimed on the March 26, 1971 and by the Laws Continuance Enforcement Order, made by the acting President on April 10, 1971 at Mujibnagar, all laws those were in force in Bangladesh on March 25, 1971, would subject to the Proclamation, continued to be so in force. After Liberation of Bangladesh, on the commencement of the Constitution on December 16, 1972, the afore- said Order was repealed under Article 151(a) but by Article 149, subject to the Constitution all existing laws, continued to have effect.                ",
      "372. Under Article 63, only with the assent of the Parliament, war may be declared or the Republic may participate in war, otherwise not.  ",
      "371. However, it is the Parliament, under Article 62, which regulates the defence services by legislation in respect of its raising and maintenance including its reserve and auxiliary forces, granting of commissions, the appointment of the Chief of Staff of all the defence services and the terms and conditions of their service.the discipline and other related matters.  ",
      "370. Article 61 confers the President with the Supreme Command of the defence services of Bangladesh. Such command shall, however, be exercised by law to be made by the Parliament. Besides, the President, under Article 48(3), general- ly exercises all his functions and acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.  ",
      "369. According to our Constitution, the President is the head of the State while the Prime Minister is the Head of the Government.  ",
      "368. Article 56(1) provides for a Prime Minister of the Republic, Article 55(2) provides that the executive powers of the Republic shall be exer- cised by or on the authority of the Prime Minister,  ",
      "367. Article 48 of the Constitution provides that there shall be a President of Bangladesh. He shall be elected by the members of Parliament.  ",
      "366. In the Constitution of Bangladesh, Part IV starts with the broad heading ‘The Executive.’ Chapter I under Part IV deals with Office of ‘The President’, Chapter II] deals with ‘The Prime Minister and The Cabinet’, Chapter IV deals with ‘The Defence Services’.  ",
      "365. As such, the Martial Law declared on August 20, 1975, had no semblance of legal basis or excuse of any sort and was absolutely illegal under all forms of jurisprudence.  ",
      "364. In the morning of August 15, 1975, in Bangladesh, the learned Additional Attorney- Genera] admitted, there was no rebellion or civil war or insurrection or riotous activities in Dhaka or in any other parts of the country, from any quarter other than the said very section of the armed forces with whose active collaboration Khandaker Moshtague Ahmed, seized the office of the President of Bangladesh. Apparently, the said Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed and his band of rene- gades, themselves are the perpetrators of the distur- bance in the country. The Courts were not closed, rather the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was ousted by the Martial law Proclamation. The coun- try was not attacked by any foreign invaders or there was no disturbance inside the country except those created by the perpetrators of Martial Law them- selves.  ",
      "363. In the case of State of Bihar vs Bal Mukund Sah (2000) 4 SCC 640, the question was whether the State Legislature, totally ignoring the  High Court, can enact a statutory provision, intro-  ducing a scheme of reservation in the subordinate               judiciary. In highlighting the basic structure doctrine SB Majumder, J., observed at para - 32: <br> \"'32.It is true, as submitted by leaned  Senior Counsel, Shri Dwivedi for the appellant  State that under Article 16(4) the State is  enabled to provide for reservations in services.  But so far as “Judicial Service™ is concerned, the Governor,  such reservation can be made by in exercise of his rule-making power only after  consultation with the High Court But so long as it is not done, the Legislature cannot,  by an indirect method, completely by passing the High Court and exercising its legislative power, circumvent and cut across the very scheme of recruitment and appointment to the District Judiciary as envisaged by the makers of the Constitution. Such an exercise, apart from being totally forbidden by the constitutional  scheme, will also fall foul on the concept relat- ing to “separation Of powers between the   Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary” as well as the fundamenta| concept of an “inde- pendent Judiciary™ Both these concepts are now elevated to the level of basic structure of the Constitution and are the very heart of the  constitutional scheme”(Page - 683 - 4).  To Sum-up: <br> (i) The Constitution of Bangladesh is an ‘autochthonous’ Constitution. This is a  rigid or controlled and an organic  _ instrument. <br> (ii) “The pith and substance of a legislation’ s crucial. It is for the Court to probe  whether it is legal or invalid and ‘the Court must not decline to open its €yes to the truth’. <br>  (iii) The Constitution clothes the Parliament with the general power to legislate on  any matter but this is subject to the fun- damental limitations formulated in the  Constitution and the specific procedure stipulated therein.                             (iv) The President or any body else has got no power to amend the Constitution. <br> (v) Parliament may amend a provision of the Constitution following the neces- sary procedure but can neither abrogate it nor suspend it or change its basic fea-  ture or structure. <br> (vi)  The power to destroy is not a power to amend. <br> (vii) The ‘law’ in Article 7 is conclusively d to include an amending law. An amending law becomes part of the Constitution but an amendment, cannot be valid if it is inconsistent with the  Constitution. <br> (viii) Article 142 merely  confers the enabling power for amendment but cannot swal- low the constitutional fabrics. <br>  (ix) The fabrics of the Constitution cannot be dismantled even by the Parliament which is a creation of the Constitution  itself.   <br>     (x) The amendments of the Constitution  must be tested against Article 7 since such power of the Parliament is given by the Constitution itself, as such, must reside  within the ambit of the Constitution and itself not beyond it.  (xi) The power to amend under Article 142   is wide but is not that wide to abrogate the Constitution or to transform its democratic republican character into one of dictatorship or monarchy or 10 legalise illegalities.  (xii) Sovereignty of the people, supremacy of the Constitution, Rule of Law, Democracy, Republican form of Government, Unitary State, Separation of powers, Independence of the judiciary. Fundamental Rights, Secularism, aré the basic structures of the Constitution.  (xiii) The Court has got power to undo an amendment if it transgresses its limit and alters a basic structure of the Constitution, If an Act of Parliament conflicts with the Constitution, it has the duty to say that the Act is not law.  Part XXIII Constitution Vis-a-vis Martial Law: Bangladesh  ",
      "362. The power of Judicial review, vested in the High Court and Supreme Court, as a basic fea- ture of the Constitution, was examined by AM Ahmedi, CJI in the case of L Chandra Kumar vs Union of India AIR 1997 SC 1125, at para - 78.  ",
      "361. BP Jeevan Reddy, J also gave a separate but concurring Judgment highlighting the concept of Rule of Law and secularism as basic features of the Constitution of India.  ",
      "358. In considering the concept of secularism, Sawant, J., held at para -88: <br> “88.These contention inevitably invite us to discuss the concept of secularism as acceplt- ed by our Constitution. Our Constitution docs not prohibit the practice of any religion either privately or publicly. ...... Under Articles 14, 15 and 16, the Constitution prohibits discrimina- tion against any citizen on the ground of his religion and guarantees cqual protection of law and cqual opportunity of public employ-  ment.(Page-2000).............   The State is enjoined to accord equal treatment to all religions and religious sects and denomi- nations. (Page- 2000),...... »  ",
      "357. In the case         of SR Bommai vs Union of India AIR 1994 SC 1918 various aspects of the Constitution of India was considered. Ahmedi, J (as his Lordship then was) in considering secularism as one of the basic structures of the Constitution observed at para — 28: <br> “28.Notwithstanding the fact that the  words ‘Socialist’, and ‘Secular’ were added in the Preamble of the Constitution in 1976 by the 42nd Amendment, the concept of Secularism was very much embedded in our Constitutional philosophy....-- By this amendment what was implicit Was made explicit. The Preamble itself  spoke of liberty of thought, expression. belief, faith and worship. While granting this_liberty the Preamble promised_equality of status and opportunity. It also spoke of promoting fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation. While granting to its citizens liberty of belief, faith and worship, the Constitution abhorred discrim- ination on grounds of religion etc., but permit- ted special treatment for Scheduled Castes and Tribes, vide Articles 15 and 16 . Art. 25 next provided, subject to public order, morality and  health, that all persons shall be entitled to free-  dom of conscience and the right to profess, practice  and propagate religion, Art. 26  State’s revenue cannot be utilized for the promotion and maintenace  of any religion or religious group- that_secularism is a basic feature_of our                Constitution.......... \" (Page-1951.52)   ",
      "356. The case of Subhesh Sharma vs Union of India AIR 1991 SC 631, is in the nature of a public interest litigation, praying for filling up of the vacancies of Judges in the Supreme Court of India and also several other High Courts there. In consid- ering the basic structure doctrine, the Supreme  Court held at para -44: <br> “44.Judicial Review is a part of the basic  constitutional structure and one of the basic fea- tures of the essential Indian Constitutional pol-                icy, This essential constitutional doctrine does not by itself justify or necessitate any primacy to the executive wing on the ground of its polit- ical accountability to the electorate. On the con- trary what is necessary is an interpretation sus- taining the strength and vitality of Judicial  review........\" (Page = 646).                     ",
      "355. In declaring the amendment of Article- 100 and Article-107 of the Constiitution as unconsti- tutional, his Lordship reminded the duties of the cit-  izens at para — 488: <br> “488............... The future_of the  Constitution lies in the commitment of the citi- zens who _are obliged under article 21 of the Constitution to_observe the Constitution.”  (Page- 181).  ",
      "354. In considering the rule of la in the Preamble of the Constitution, his Lordship  observed at para — 443: <br> «443.In this case we ar€ concerned with only one basic feature, the rule of law, marked out as one of the fundamental aims of our soci- ety in the Preamble. ... .\"(Page-171)  ",
      "353. MH Rahman, J (as his Lordship then  was), in considering the basic structure doctrine observed at para — 438: <br> 435 . The doctrine of basic structure is one growing point in the constitutional jurispru-  dence, it has developed in a climate where the executive, commanding an overwhelming majority in the legislature, gets snap amend- ments of the Constitution passed without a Green Paper  or White Paper, without eliciting any public opinion without sending the Bill to any select committee and without sufficeint time to the members of the Parliament for deliberation on the bill for amendment                  ",
      "352. In appreciating the argument that the amendment destroyed a basic structure of the Constitution his Lordship held the amendment void at para - 377 -378: <br> “377 . Main objection to the doctrine of basic structure is that it is uncertain in nature and is based on unfounded fear.  . If by exercising the amending power people’s sovereignty is sought to be curtailed it  is the constitutional duty of the Court to restrain it and in that case it will be improper to accuse the Court of acting as “super-legislators”™.    ",
      "351. On consideration of the amended Article along with other provisions of the Constitution, his Lordship found the amended provision inconsistent with other provisions of the Constitution at para-373.  ",
      "350. In recognizing the concept of the basic structure of the Constitution, his Lordship observed at para - 34°: <br> “341 There is, however, a substantial dif- ference between Constitution and its amend- ment. Before the amendment becomes a part of the Constitution it shall have to pass through some test, because it is not enacted by the peo-  ple through a Constituent Assembly.   ",
      "349. Shahabuddin Ahmed, J, (as his Lordship then was) explained the word ‘amendment’ of the Constitution at para -336:  336..............;  the word ‘amendment’ or ‘amend’ has been used in different places to mean different things; so it is the context by referring to which the actual meaning of the word ‘amendment’ can be ascertained. My con- clusion, therefore, is that the word “a;n_ejﬂ: ment” is a change or alteration, for the purpose of bringing in_improvement in the statute (o  make it more effective_and meaningful, but it does not mean_its abrogation destruction or a                change resulting in the loss of its original iden-  tity and character. In the case of amendment of a constitutional provision “amendment” should be that which accords with the intention of the makers of the Constitution.” (Page-141).  ",
      "347. His Lordship found that the amended artcle — 100 is ultra vires because it was inconsis- tent with the various provisions of the Constitution in disregard of Article 7 which forbids such a law. In accepting the contentions in this regard his Lordship  observed at para 198 — 199: «198.Mr Syed Ishtiaq Ahmad reinforced  the argument by his inimitable way of expound-  ing the Constitution pointing to ‘its grace and  beauty and termed it as an unique constitution  because Article 7 is not to be found in any other Constitution standing like statue of liberty.  arti  199 . Mr Asrarul Hossain and Mr Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed pointed out that Article 7 was never amended, no attempt was made because such exercise would be in futility constitutionally. (Page-97)  ",
      "345. With regard to the amending power of the parliament, Badrul Haider Chowdhury, J (as his Lordship then was), held at para — 165-166: <br> 165.The Attorney-General argued that the amending power is a constituent power. It is not a legislative power and therefore, the Parliament has unlimited power to amend the Constitution invoking its constituent power.  166.The argument is untenable. The Attorney-General argued this point keeping an eye on Article 368 of the Constitution of India which says that “Parliament may in exercise of its constituent power amend” etc. which was inserted by amendment following certain obser- vations in the Golak Nath case. The amendment therefore recognised the distinction between an ordinary law and 2 constitutional amendment. It will not be proper to express any opinion as to the merit of any constitutional amendment made in Constitution of another country. It will be enough that our Constitution does not make  such distinction. Secondly, our Constitution is not only a controlled one but the limitation on legislative capacity of the Parliament is  enshrined in such a way that a removal of any plank will bring down the structure itself , For  this reason, the Preamble, Article 8, had been  made unamendable—it has to be referred to the  people! At once Article 7 stares on the face to say: “All power in the Republic_belongs to the people , and more, \"their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under and by the authority of this Constitution\" To dispel any doubt it says: \"This Constitution is as the solemn expression of the will of the people\" The  Preamble says ‘it is our sacred duty t0 safe-  guard, protect, and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh”.  If Article 26 and Article 7  are read together the position will be clear. The exclusiduary provision of the kind incorporated in Article 26 by amendment has not been incor- porated in Article 7 . That shows that the ‘law’  in Article 7 is conclusively intended to include an_amending law. An amending law becomes part of the Constitution but an amending law cannot_be valid if it is inconsistent with the Constitution, The contention of the Attorney- General on the non-obstante clause in Article  142 is bereft of any substance ‘because that clause merely confers enabling power for  amendment but by interpretative decision that clause cannot be given the status for swallow-  ing_up_the constitutional fabric. It may be noticed that unlike 1956 Constitution or Sree  Lanka Constitution there is no provision in our Constitution for replacing the Constitution.”                 ",
      "344. Martial Law was proclaimed for the sec- ond time in Bangladesh on March 24, 1982, by Lieutenant General HM Ershad NDC psc, the Chief of Army Staff of Bangladesh. By this proclamation he assumed unlimited, supreme and absolute power in the Government of Bangladesh, in the garb of Chief Martial Law Administrator, for governing this country by anything but the Constitution (Para-274 of the 8th Amendment case). Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh was suspended and the Country was ruled by Martial Law Proclamations, Orders and Regulations. By the Martial Law Order No. 11 of 1982, four permanent Benches of the High Court was set-up in various places in the country including one at Dhaka. The Constitution, however, was restored on November 10, 1986 . On June 9, 1988 Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Act, 1988, was passed, amending Article-100 of the Constitution, among others, set- ting up six permanent Benches in difterent district Head-Quarters of the country. The constitutionality of such amendment of Article-100 was challenged on the ground inter alia that the said amendment  was beyond the amending power of the Parliament                 under Article 142 of the Constitution and that by this amendment a basic structure of the Constitution was destroyed. The High Court Division rejected the pciilions summarily. The appeals were allowed by (he majority of 3 to 1 in the Appellate Division.  ",
      "343. Next we shall discuss the decision in the case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD (Spl) 1 . This case is also known as the Constitution 8th Amendment case. This is a histori- cal Judgment of our Apex Court and we intend to  deal with it rather elaborately.  ",
      "340. Chandrachud, CJ, on behalf of the major- ity observed at para-22 about the limited power of amendment of the Constitution: <br>               “22.Since the Constitution had conferred a limited amending power on the Parliament, the  Parliament_cannot_under_the_exercise_of_that limited power enlarge that very power into_an absolute_power, Indeed, a limited amending  power is one of the features of our Constitution and therefore, the limitations on that power can- not be destroyed. In other words, Parliament  cannot, under Article 368, expand its amending power so as to aquire for itself the right to repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to destroy its basic and_essential features, The donee of a limited power cannot by the exercise of that power convert the limited power into an unlimited one.”   ",
      "339. Clause 4 of Section 55 deprive the Courts of their power to call in question any amendment of the Constitution while clause 5 confers upon the Parliament a vast and undefined power to amend the Constitution.  ",
      "338. Section 4 amended Article 31C of the Constitution to the extent that no law giving eflect to the policy of the State would be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with any of the rights under Articles 14, 19 or 31.  ",
      "337. The next important case we shall consid- er is Minerva Mills Ltd vs Union of India AIR 1980) SC 1789 . The company and its share-holders, the petitioners in this case, challenged the constitution- al validity of certain provisions of the Sick Textile Undertaking (Nationalisation) Act, 1974 and the Order of the Government authorizing taking over of the management of Minerva Mills Ltd. The consti- tutional validity of Sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act, 1976, was also challenged and the Supreme Court, in this case, considered the said constitutional issue.  ",
      "334. Kesavanana Bharati'’s case was followed and explained in the case of Smt. Indira Nehru                Gandhi vs Shri Raj Narayan AIR 1975 SC 2299, In that case, the legality of clause 4 of Article 329-A was challenged. The Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975, inserted the said Article, One of the purposes of the amendment was to con- fer validity on the election of Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi to the Lok Sabha in 1971, The question was whether the provisions of clause 4 of Article 329 by which the constituent authority in eflect prescribed that no election law was to govern the challenge to the election of the appellant, or whether it is void on the ground that it effects the basic structure of the  Constitution.   ",
      "333. All the seven Judges, however, who con- stituted the majority in Kesavananda Bharati, agreed that democratic set-up is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India.  ",
      "332. The summary of the views signed by nine out of thirteen learned Judges are amongst others: <br> “1.Golak Nath's case is overruled. <br> 2.Article 368 does not enable parliament to alter the basic structure or frame-work of the Constitution,  ",
      "331. In considering the purpose of amend- ment of the Constitution and the implied limitation upon such power his Lordships held at para — 681:  «681.There is a further fallacy in the con- tention that whenever Constitution is amended.  we should presume that the amendment in ques- tion was made in order to adopt the Constitution to  respond to the growing needs of the peo- ple...... A power which is capable of being used against the people themselves cannot be considered as a power exercised on behalf of the people or in their interest.”. <br> ( The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "330. In perceiving the dreams of the founding fathers in achieving independence and enacting a modern Constitution for India with lofty ideals in a broad and prismatic perspective, Hedge and Muykherjee, JJ, themselves carried away with their deep sense of concomitant to their nation-hood at para — 664: <br> “664 . From the preamble it is quite clear that the two primary objectives that were befors the Constituent Assembly were (1) to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic and (2) to secure to its citizens the rights men- tioned therein. Our founding fathers, at any rate, most of them had made immense sacrifices for the sake of securing those objectives.   Their constitutional plan was to build a welfare state and an egalitarian society.”  ",
      "329. Although many of the matters with regard to the amendments curtailing the fundamen- tal rights to property had already been judicially set- tled but it is still justiciable if the basic structure of the Constitution is dented,  ",
      "328. To summarise, his Lordship, Sikri, CJ, held at para — 492: <br> “492, To summarise, I hold that: <br> (a) Golak Nath's case, (1967) 2 SCR 762 = (AIR 1967 SC 1643), declared that a Consti- tutional amendment would be bad if it infringed Article 13 (2), as this applied not only to ordi-  nary legislation but also to an amendment of the Constitution. <br> (b) Golak Nath's case, (1967) 2 SCR 762 = (AIR 1967 SC 1643). Did not decide whether Article 13 (2) can be amended under Article 368 or determine the exact meaning of the expression “amendment of this Constitution™ in Article 368. <br>   (d) The Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1971, as interpreted by me, has been validly enacted. <br> (e) Article 368 does not enable Parliament in its constituent capacity to delegate its func- tion of amending the Constitution to another legislature or to itself in its ordinary legislative capacity. <br> (f) Section 2 of the Constitution (Twenty- fifth Amendment) Act, 1971, as interpreted by me, is valid. <br> (g) Section 3 of the Constitution (Twenty- fifth Amendment) Act, 1971 is void as it dele- gates power to legislatures to amend the Constitution. <br> (h) The Constitution (Twenty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1971 is ineffective to protect the impugned Acts if they abrogate or take away fundamental rights. The constitution Bench will decide whether the impugned Acts take away fundamental rights or only abridge them, and in the latter case whether they effect reasonable abridgments in the public interest.” (The underlinings are mine)  Regarding amendments vis-a-vis the basic structure of the Constitution, Shelat and Grover,                 jj held in Kishavananda in para < 599-.600:  _\"599% The basic structure_of the Constitution_is_not_a_vague_coneept_and the apprehensions expressed on behalf of the respondents that neither the citizen nor the Parliament would be able to understand it are unfounded. If the historical background , the the relevant provisions thereof, including Article 368 are kept in mind there can be no dif- ficulty in discerning that the following can be regarded as the basic elements of the constitution structure, (These cannot be catalogued but can only be illustrated). <br> 1 . The supremacy of the Constitution. <br> 2 . Republican and Democratic form of Government and sovereignty of the country. <br> 3 Secular and federal character of the Constitution. <br> 4 . Demarcation of power between the leg- islature, the executive and the judiciary. <br> 5 . The dignity of the individual secured by the Various freedoms and basic rights in Part III and the mandate to build a wel- fare State contained in Part IV. <br> 6 . The unity and the integrity of the nation.”  ",
      "327. In considering whether the 24th Amendment enlarged the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, his Lordship held at para - 408 and 410: <br> “408.It seems to me that it is not legitimate to interpret Article 368 in this manner. Clause (e) of the proviso does not give any different power than what is contained in the main arti- cle. The meaning of the expression “Amend- ment of the Constitution” does not change when one reads the proviso. If the meaning is the same, Article 368 can only be amended so as not to change its identity completely. Parliament, for instance, could not make the Constitution uncontrolled by changing the pre- scribed two thirds majority to simple majority. Similarly it cannot get rid of the true meaning of the expression “Amendment of the Constitution™ so as to derive power to abrogate fundamental rights.” <br> “410....... . Under__Article 368 Parliament can amend every article of the Constitution as long as the result is within the  imits already laid down by me. The amend- ment of Article 13(2) does not go beyond the limits laid down because Parliament cannot even after the amendment abrogate or authorize abrogation or the taking away of fundament rights. After the amendment now a law which  has the effect of merely abridging a right while  remaining_within the limits laid down would not be liable to be struck down.”  ",
      "326. In conclusion, his Lordship regarded the First and Fourth Amendment as made within the amending power of the Parliament,  ",
      "325. In response to the argument in respect of waiver of rights, on the basis of an observation by SK Das, J. in Basheshar Nath vs CIT AIR 1959 SC 149, the Hon'ble Chief Justice, held at para — 312: <br> «312.T must point out that the learned Judge was expressing the minority opinion that there could be a waiver of fundamental rights in certain circumstances. Das, CJ, and Kapur, J, held that there could be no waiver of funda- mental rights founded on Article 14 of the Constitution, while Bhagwati and Subba Rao, JJ held that there could be no waiver not only of fundamental rights enshrined in Article 14 but also of any other fundamental rights guaranteed  by Part 11 of the Constitution.”                ",
      "324. In repelling the Hon’ble Chief  Seerevai, Advocate General, Justice held at para — 308: <br> «308.He also relied on the words “rights  conferred” in Article 13(2) and “enforcement of  any rights conferred by this Part” to show that  they were not natural or inalienable and could  not have been claimed by them. There is no question of the sovereign people claiming them from an_outside agency. The people acting through the Constituent Assembly desired that the rights mentioned in Part 111 shall be guaran- teed and, therefore, Part 11T was enacted. In the context ‘conferred’ does not mean that_some superior power had granted these rights. It 1s very much like a King bestowing the title of “His Imperial Majesty’ on himself.”  ",
      "323. In this connection it should be remem- bered that the country belongs to the people as a                           whole and not to the members of Parliament or 1o any other body of persons. They are voted to the parliament to represent the people as their trusted agent. The members of parliament are the trustees for and on behalf of the people of Bangladesh as a whole. As such, all the rights belong to the people, although in order to protect their interest, their rights are sometimes required to be adjusted or even cur- tailed but within the ambit of the Constitution itself.  kecping in view their inalienable rights.  the contention of Mr  ",
      "303. The _above structure is built on the basic foundation i.e. the dignity of supreme importance.  of the individual. This is of supreme impor- This cannot by any form of amendment be destroyed.  304.The above foundation and the above basic features are easily discernible_not only from the preamble but the whole scheme of the Constitution, which I have already discussed.”  ",
      "322. Regarding the basic feature of the Cons-  titution. his Lordship held as follows:  «302.The learned Attorney-General said that every provision of the Constitution is essential: otherwise it would not have been put in the Constitution. This is true. But this does not place every provision of the Constitution in the same position. The true position is that everv provision of the Constitution can _be amended provided in the result the basic foun- dation and structure of the constitution remains  the same. The basic structurc may be said to consist of the following features; <br> (1) Supremacy of the Constitution; <br> (2) Republican and Democratic forms of Government. ‘ <br> (3) Secular character of the Constitution; <br> (4) Separation of powers between the legis- lature, the executive and the judiciary; <br> (5) Federal character of the Constitution.  ",
      "321. On consideration of different provisions of the Constitution, Sikri, CJ, explained an amend  ment of the Constitution in this tnanner 24 gz 791 - 294 and para- 297-299. <br> “291, What is the necessary implication from all the provisions of the Constitution/?  reading fie  292 . It seems to me that the reading the preamble , the fundamental importance of the freedom of the individual, indeed its inalienability and the importance of the economic, social and political justice mentioned in the preamble the importance of directive principles,  the non-inclusion in Article 362 of provi- sions like Arts,52, 53 and various other provi- snons to vhich rcfercncc has already  been made an irresistable conclusion emerges that it was not the intention to use the word \"amendment\" in the widest sense,  293 . It was the common understanding that fundamental rights would remain in substance as they are and they would not be amended out of existence. It seems also to have been a com- mon understanding that the fundamental <b> fea- tures of the Constitution, manely, secularism, democracy and the freedom of the individual would always subsist in the welfare state. </b>  294 . In view of the above reasons, a neces- sary implication arises the power of Parliament  that the expression “amendment of this Consti- tution\" has consequently a limited meaning in  our Constitution and not the meaning suggested  by the respondents.  297 . For the aforesaid reasons, I am driven  to the conclusion that the expression “amend- ment of this  Constitution\" in Art, 368 means any addition or change in any of the provisions of the Constitution within the broad contours of  the preamble and the Constitution to carry out the objectives in the Preamble and the Directive Principles. Applied to fundamental rights, it would mean that while fundamental rights can- not be abrogated reasonable abridgments of fundamental rights can be effected in the public  interest.                           298, It is of course for Parliament to decide whether an amendment is necessary. The Courts will not be concerned with the wisdom of the amendment.  200, If this meaning is given it would enable Parliament to adjust fundamental rights in order to secure what the Directive Principles direct to be accomplished, while maintaining the freedom and dignity of every citizen.”  ",
      "320. The rigid formulation in Golak Nath’s  case that all fundamental rights are non-amendable by the Parliament, was modified in the Kesavananda Bharati's case. It was decided in the said case by a majority of 9-4 that the basic features of the Constitution cannot be destroyed or changed by the process of amendment, rather, those ideals and values of the Constitution should be preserved. The approach in the Kesavananda’s case was flexi- ble. It was decided therein that whether the relevant fundamental right constitutes a ‘basic feature’ or not remains with the Court to decide finally on the facts and circumstances of each case. It should be noted that even in this case it was held that the fundamen- tal right to property is not a basic feature of the Constitution and thereby over-ruled the decision in the Golak Nath's case.  ",
      "319. In this case, the validity of Twenty- fourth, Twenty-fifth and Twenty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution of India, further denting the already truncated fundamental right to property, was under challenge. Besides, the correctness of the decision in Golak Nath’s case was also decided. However, in deciding these above noted questions, the real issue before the Supreme Court was the extent of the amending power, conferred by Article 368 of the Constitution apart form Article 13(2), on the Parliament.  ",
      "318. Next we shall consider the decision of the gupreme Court of India in the case of Kesavananda Bharati etc. vs State of Kerala etc, AIR 1973 SC 1461 . This is a historical and land-mark Judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of India. Since we agree and rely on the principles stated in this deci-  sion, we shall refer to it some what elaborately.  ",
      "317. In over-ruling the earlier decisions in Shankari Prasad’s and Sajjan Singh’s case, the majority of the Court reached the following conclu-  sion at para = 53: <br> \"(53) The aforesaid discussion leads to the  following results: <br> (1) The power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution is derived from Arts. 254, 246 and 248 of the Constitution and not from Art. 368 thereof, which only deals with procedure. Amendment is a legislative process. <br> (2) Amendment is ‘law’ within the mean- ing of Art. 13 of the Constitution and, therefore, if it takes away or abridges the rights conferred by part 111 thereof, it is void. <br> (3) The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, and the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, abridge the scope of the fundamental rights. But, on the basis of ear- lier decisions of this Court, they were valid. <br> (4) On the application of the doctrine of ‘prospective overruling’, as explained by us earlier, our decision will have only prospective operation and, therefore, the said amendments will continue to be valid. <br> (5) We declare that the Parliament wij] have no power from the date of this decision to amend any of the provisions of part I of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights enshrined therein. <br> (6) As the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act holds the field, the validity of                the two impugned Acts, namely, The Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act X of 1953, and the Mysore Land Reforms Act X of 1962, as amended by Act X1V of 1965, cannot be ques- tioned on the ground that they offend Arts, 13, 14 or 31 of the Constitution,”  ",
      "316. It may be recalled that in Shankari Prasad’s case (AIR 1951 SC 456), the First Amend- ment to the Constitution of India curtailing the fun- damental right to property by inserting Article 31 A and 31 B was held to be valid. This decision was  _assumed to be correct in a number of subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of India. But in  Sajjan Singh's case (AR 1965 SC §45), two of the learned Judges inclined to take a different view. The conflict between the majority and the minority views was resolved in Golak Noth's case by consti- wuting a larger Bench of 11 (eleven) learned Judges. Subba Rao, CJ, on behalf of himself and four other judges gave the leading Judgment, supported by another Judgment, separately given by Hidayatulla,  J.  ",
      "315. The Seventeenth Amendment was enact- ed in 1964, widening further the ambit of Article 31A, included by the first Amendment. It provided among others the inclusion of ‘ryotwari’ tenure within the definition of ‘estate’, as such, any legis- lation in respect of such ryotwari tenure became immune from challenge on the ground of violation  of fundamental right to property. Besides, the said amendment added a further forty four new statutes passed by the various states to schedule IX to the Constitution, making those immune from challenge. With this amendment, the total number of immu- nized statutes rose to sixty-four.  ",
      "314. In the case of Golak Nath vs State of Punjab AIR 1967 SC 1643, constitutionality of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution was under challenge.  ",
      "313. It would appear that in Sajjan Singh’s case Hidayatullah, J, propounded the theory of non- amenability of fundamental rights while Mudholkar, J expressed his views, although with caution, that the basic features of the Constitution are not amend- able.  ",
      "312. In the case of Sajjan Singh vs State of Rajasthan AIR 1965 SC 845, the validity of Constitution (seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, was under challenge. The said amendment again seriously affected the fundamental right to property. The majority of the Supreme Court, in following the decision in Shankeri Prasad, upheld the validity of the said Amendment Act, 1964 . But the minority of the judges expressed their doubts about the correct- ness of the decision in Shankari Prasad’s Case. His Lordship further held at para-62.  (62). It has been said, no doubt, that the preamble is not a part of our Constitution. But, I think, that if upon a comparison of the pream- ble with the broad features of the Constitution it                would appear that the preamble is an epitome of those features or, to_put it differently_of these features are_an_amplification_or concretisation of the concepts set out in the premble, it may have to be considered whether the preamble is not a part of the Constitution. While consider- ing this question it would be of relevance to  >  bear in mind that the preamble is not of the common run such as is to be found in an Act of a legislature, It has the stamp of deep deliberation has it marked by precision. Would this not suggest that the farmers of the Constitution attached special significance to it?  ",
      "311. These observations of the Pakistan Supreme Court were upheld in the minority judg- ment of Mudholkar, J. in the case of Sajjan Singh vs State of Rajasthan AIR 1965 SC 845 at para — 59, page- 864.  ",
      "310. In highlighting the main feature of the Constitution, his Lordship further held at page - 538: <br> “The main feature of the Constitution, therefore, is that a Minister should not be a member of the House, he should have no right to vote therein, nor should his tenure of office be dependent upon the support of the majority of the members of the Assembly nor should he be responsible to the Assembly. This is an essential characteristic of a Presidential form of Government and Mr Brohi appearing on behalf of the respondent has called it the “main fabric”  t of government sought to be set u by the present Constitution. An alternation of this “main fabric”, therefore, so as to destroy it altogether cannot, in my view, be called an adaptation of the Constitution for purpose of  implementing it.”  ",
      "309. Approving Cooley in this respect, Hamoodur Rahman, J, (as his Lordship then was) observed at page — 535: <br> “A Constitution”, says Cooley in his Treatise on Constitutional Limitations is “the fundamental law of a State, containing the prin- ciples upon which the Government is founded, regulating the division of the sovereign powers, and directing to what persons each of these powers is to be confined, and the manner in which it is to be exercised.” The fundamental principle underlying a written Constitution is that it not only specifies the persons or authori- ties in whom the sovereign powers of the State are to be vested but also lays down fundamen- tal rules for the selection or appointment of such persons or authorities and above all fixes the limits of the exercise of those powers, Thu:  written Constitution i :_source fro which all governmental power emanates and i defines its scope and ambit so that each func ionarv should act within his respective sphere  No power can, therefore, be claimed by any   functionary which_is not to be found within (he  four corners of the Constitution nor can anyone transgress the limits therein specified,”  ",
      "308. In the same case, Fazle Akbar, J,  observed at page - 523:  In any event it is clear from Part-X1 of the Constitution that no power_has been bestowed               on the Preseident to amend the Constitutionat his own will,” His Lordship further held at page — 524: <br> “From the language of the Atticle it is abundantly clear that this_Article was never meant to bestow power on the President to change the fundamentals of the Constitution, Our Constitution has provided for a Presidential form of government and the President by the impugned Order has introduced a semi-Parlia- mentary form of Government. As already stat-  ed, this Article 224(3) was never meant to  bestow _power on the President to change the fundamental of the  Constitution. However  wholesome the intention and however noble the motive may_be the extra-constitutional action  could not be supported because the President  was not entitled to get beyond the Constitution and touch any of the fundamentals of the Constitution.”  ",
      "307. In dismissing the appeal before the  Supreme Court, PLD 1963 SC 486, Cornelius, CJ, emphatically ordained as far back as in 1963 at page  -512: <br> “The impression is clear and unavoidable that the ground of expediency was based on a desire to accede to the wishes of certain per- sons, probably a fairly small number of persons, but the Constitution was not intended to be varied according to the wishes of any person or persons.\"  unless provided by the Constitution itself, would be a violation of the  Constitution, and if the Constitution were itself altered for some such reason, and that in a sub-  stantial, and not_merely a machinery_aspect there would clearly be an erosion, a whittling  away of its provisions, which it would be the duty  of the superior Courts to resist in defence of the Constitution . The aspect of the franchise, and of the form of Government are fundamental features of a Constitution and to alter them, in limine in order to placate or secure the support of a few persons, would appear to be equivalent not to bringing the given Constitution into force, but to bringing into_effect an altered or different Constitution..”  ",
      "306. Under such circumstances, in declaring the impugned Order 34 of 1962 wltra vires to the  Constitution being in excess of the powers of the President Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Murshed, J. held at para - 78: <br> “78 . The text of Article 224 (3) is very clear  and unambiguous. It does not permit alterations of the provisions of the Constitution for a solution of a olitical situation brought about by some members of the National assembly who  refused to accept appointments as Ministers, if such appointments entailed cessation of their  membership of the Assembly.”  ",
      "305. In the above noted case, Fazlul Quader Chowdhury, Khan A Sabur Khan and Wahiduz- zaman were elected as the members of the National Assembly of Pakistan. Shortly thereafter, they were also appointed to the President’s Council of Ministers in pursuance of an Order passed by the President, pur- ported to have been passed under Article 224 (3) of the Constitution, in order to remove the difficulty in the formation of the Council of Ministers. Such appointment, their membership in the National  assembly was challenged in this case. In considering the process of amendment of the Constitution in gen- eral, Murshed, J. held at para- 53: <br> “53.......A Constitution is a solemn and sacred document of seminal and supreme con- sequence, partaking the nature of almost scrip- tura sanctity, embodying, as it usually does, the  final will and testament of the sovereign authority- that resides in the people and providing the manner and norms of the Government of a nation. It therefore, assumes something of the immutability of the laws of the Medes and the  Persians. It is not subject to easy change which is usually effected by a special and somewhat difficult process. In the present Constitution the provisions with regard to \"amendment\" of the Constitution have been enumerated in Articles 208 to 210 . We may note that it requires a two- thirds majority of the Legislature to effect an amendment in the Constitution.\"    ",
      "303. Murshed, J in the case or Md Abdul  Haque vs Fazlul Quader Chowdhury PLD 1963  Dhaka 669 = 15 DLR 355, tead the above dictum in this perspective at page — 698 M:  “The aforesaid dictum of the Supreme  Court of Pakistan is a pointer that in the case  before us the power of “adaptation” does not  xtend wiping out of a vital provision of  the Constitution to implement a decision of the members of the Assembly who were invited to  be Ministers.”                  ",
      "302. The First Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had been passed by the Constituent Assembly on the February 29, 1956 and assent to it was given by the Governor General on March 2, 1956 . It came into force on March 23, 1956 and Pakistan ceased to be a Dominion and became a Republic on and from that date. The President of Pakistan made reference under Article 162 of the Constitution to the Supreme Court for its opinion as to whether the Governor of a Province was empowered to dissolve the Provincial Assembly. Munir, CJ., in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court [PLD 1957 SC 219 = 9 DLR (SC) 178] observed at para — 33 (DLR): <br> [......., The Constitution defines the qualifications which a candidate for election to the Provincial Assembly, or a voter in a con- stituency for such Assembly, must possess: but Mr Manzur Qadir would give to the President  under Article 234 the power to destroy, though for a temporary period, the very basis of the new Constitution by claiming for him the power to_form the constituencies and to order the preparation of electoral rolls in direct violation  of the Constitution merely to im lement_the  \"  ecision ioverno  ",
      "301. It appears that the Supreme Court of India in Shankari Prasad’s case, adopted a literal interpretation of the Constitution of India and held that Article 13 envisages legislative law made by a legislature but not 1o a constituent law, made to mend the Constitution. The Court rejected the argument that the fundamental rights including the  right to property are sacrosanct and are not amend- able in the normal process under Article 368 of the Constitution. The whole decision, it appears, hinged upon an assumption that the expression ‘law’ in Article 13 (2) does not include constitutional law.  ",
      "300. The facts leading to the Shankari Prasad’s case were that immediately after independence, the Parliament in India carried out agrarian reforms by enacting various laws. This resulted in the abolition of Zemindaries in various States in India. Those Acts were challenged on the ground that the funda- mental rights as stated in Part 111 of the Constitution were contravened. The Union Government, in order to put an end to these litigations and also to push ahead with its agrarian reforms in aid of The millions of landless peasants, without loosing further time, passed the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 . The Supreme Court of India upheld the said  amendment of the Constitution.  ",
      "298. India adopted its Constitution in 1950 while Pakistan its first in 1956.  299, In India the First Amendment of the Constitution was made within one year of inaugura- tion of its Constitution in 1951 being the Constitu- tion (First Amendment) Act, 1951 . This amendment added two new provisions to the Constitution, namely, Article 31A and Article 31B along with the Schedule IX. These new provisions curtailed the right to property guaranteed by Article 31 . This amendment of the Constitution was challenged in the case of Shankari Prasad Singh Deo vs Union of India AIR 1951 SC 438.  ",
      "297. This Indian sub-continent gained its inde- pmdcncc by the Indian Independence Act, 1947. This Act brought into existence (wo new pominions, namely, India and Pakistan. Section 8 of the Act empowers the Constituent Assemblies of each country to frame its own Constitution.  ",
      "296. Now we shall pass on to examine the constitutional position of this sub-continent.  ",
      "295. It will also be perceived that in none of the 27 (twenty seven) amendments, the original or the basic character of the Constitution of 1787 were varied or detoured in any manner, rather, the amend- ments were all made glorifying the basic ideals embodied in the original National Constitution for which their fore-fathers fought and won a Republic for the future generations, Since none of the amend- ments violated the basic features of the original Constitution, the US Supreme Court had no occa-  sion to hold otherwise.                ",
      "294. From the above discussion it would - appear that the Constitution of the United States is a rigid one. It is the supreme law and all great Institutions of the Republic owe its existence to the Constitution. The Constitution itself provides for its amendment but the procedure is difficult and cir- cuitous but was so made in order to reflect the will of the people. Their sentiment and voice is accepted as paramount and supreme. All 27 (twenty seven) amendments were made bonafide in the interest of the Republic, the beneficiary is the people alone. None of the amendments were made for personal aggrandizement or in order to hide the illegal acts of any usurper. The amendments of the United States, unlike the Constitution (Fifth Amendment), Act. 1979 of Bangladesh, were made not only as steps towards further refinements of the original Constitution but also to highlight the harmonions picture of the entire Constitution together with its amendments. '  ",
      "293. On the question as to Constitution as lim- itation of power, American Jurisprudence, 2nd Vol. 16 states as follows: <br> “The Constitution of the United States and  any amendments thereto, together with federal laws made in pursuance thereof, and treatise made under the authority of the United States, are expressly declared to be the supreme law of the land in the Constitution itself. The constitu- tion_as the supreme law is without qualification and is absolute, While the national government is one of limited powers, those actually granted constitute the paramount authority of the land.  The Federal Constitution is binding on all offi- cers and departments h_the federal and state_Governments, including _every court  whether it derives its authority from a state or  from the United States.” (Para-51, Page-408-9).  ",
      "292. Article V of the Constitution invests the Congress with enormous power to propose almost any amendment to the Constitution except that no State can be denied of equal representation in the Senate without its consent. From time to time, vires of the amendments were challenged before the Supreme Court, for example, Nineteenth Amend- ment extending suffrage to women was challenged in Lesser vs Palmer (1920) but those attempts  proved futile.  ",
      "291. Amendments are part of the normal con- stitutional process in the United States and each amendment enriched its Constitution to some extent. Each of the twenty seven amendments con- tributed to the democratisation of the Republic and thereby highlighted the sovereignty of the people, by and for whom the Republic was brought into existence. In other words the amendment of the Constitution of the United States were meant to fur- ther grace the Republic, and enhance its prestige by achieving refinements of the Constitution but never meant for impoverish it by legalizing heinous sedi- tious acts against the Republic and its Constitution as happened more than once in Bangladesh.  ",
      "290. A reading of the amendments would unmistakably show that the first ten amendments                were made to protect the fundamental and basic human rights of the citizens of the United States. The next seventeen amendments were made during the last two hundred years of the Republic. Those amendments were made for the enhancement of the interest of the people of the United States and in general, of the Republic. During the last two hun- dred years the Republic of the United States went through a Civil war and many a crisis and in the most turbulent times, they did never disown or dis- honour their Constitution, rather, the supremacy of the Constitution was proved time and again, more so  during their national crisis.  ",
      "289. Inre Duncan (1891), 139 US 449 . 461 = 35 L. Ed. 219, Chief Justice Fuller held:  e distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of the legisla- tive power reposed in representative bodies,  whose legitimate acts maybe said to be those of  the people themselves; but while the people are thus the source of political power, their governments, National and state, have been limited by written Constitutions, and they have themselves there by set bounds to their own power, as against the sudden impulses of mere majorities\" <br>  [Quoted from cases on Constitutional Law by Professor Noel T Dowling, Fifth  Edition, Page-151 (notes)]  ",

In Ullman vs United States (1956). 350) US 422 =100L Ed 511, it was held that nothing new  can be put into the Federal Constitution except  through the amendatory process, and nothing old can be taken out without the same process (Quoted from American Jurisprudence 2d Vol. 16, page —358 n. 26).  ",
      "287. The next seventeen amendments were made during the last two hundred years, the last twenty-seventh amendment was ratified on May 7, 1992.  ",
      "286. In the case of Dorr vs United States (1904) 195 US 138 = 49 L. ED. 128, Justice Day held:  ............ <br> In every case where Congress undertales to legislate in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution, the Question may arise as to how far the exercise of the power is limited by the \"prohibitions\" of  that_instrument........ \"(Quoted from Cases on  Constitutional Law by Professor Noel. T. Dowling, Fifth Edition, 1954, page — 399- 400).”  ",
      "285. In the case of Dred Scott vs Sandford (1857), Justice Curtis held: <br> “If, then, this clause does contain a power to legislate respecting the territory, what are limits of that power? <br> “To this I answer that, in common with all the other legislative powers of Congress, it finds limits in the express prohibitions on Con-  gress not to do certain things; that, in the exer-  cise of the legislative power, Congress cannot pass an ex post facto law or bill of attainder; and so in respect to each of the other prohibi  tions contained in_the Constitution.” (Quoted from cases on Constitutional Law By Professor Noel T Dowling, Fifth Edition, 1954, page - 399)    ",
      "284. In Mormon Church vs United States (1890) 136 US 1, it was held by the Supreme Court by way of dicta: <br> “Doubtless Congress legislating for the ter- ritories would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the Constitution and its Amendments; but these limitations would exist  rather by inference an general spirit of the Constitution from which Congress derives all its powers, then by any express and direct application of its provisions.”  ",
      "283. The first ten amendments were proposed in 1789 and were ratified in December 15, 1791 and together form what is known as the Bill of Rights of the National Constitution. However, it is for the Supreme Court to say what rights are fundamental  in this sense.  ",
      "282. It may be recalled that the Federal Constitution was ratified by the thirteen States on September 17, 1987 and became operative in 1789. At that time it was assured that amendments guar- anteeing individual rights would be made forthwith, as such, the first Congress assembled under the Constitution, proposed a series of amendments to the State Legislatures in 1789.  ",
      "281. Article V provides for amendment of the   Federal Constitution, The process of amendment ts   both difficult and circuitous. It is effected by pro-   posal and ratification, An Amendment may be pro-   posed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of   Congress or by a national constitutional convention   called by Congress upon request of the Legislatures   of two-thirds of the States, The proposed amend-   ments must be ratified by the Legislatures of three-   fourths of the states or by special conventions in   three-fourths of the states, These stringent proce-   dures were made to ensure that the will of the peo-   ple will be voiced.                                  ",
      "280. It is however well settled for the last two   hundred years that the Constitution is the only   source of power in all three branches of the Federal   Government of the United States. The Supreme   Court stated and re-stated the said constitutional   position whether in war or in peace. It established      unfailingly:   <br>   “The Government of the United States was   born of the Constitution, and _all powers which   it enjoys or may exercise must be either derived      expressly_or_by implication from that instru-   ment” (Downes vs Bidwell 182 US 244, 288)\"      (Quoted from Cases on Constitutional Law by   Professor Noel T Dowling, Fifth Edition 1954,   page — 398).      ",
      "279. The Privy Council was of the view that   ‘there exists a separate power in the Judicature   which under the Constitution as it stands cannot be   usurped or infringed by the Executive or the   Legislature’. Section 29 (1) of the Constitution was   construed in this manner at page — 659 DE.   <br>   “Section 29(1) of the Constitution says:   “Subject to the provisions of this Order   Parliament shall have power to make Jaws for   the peace order and good government of the   Island.” These words have habitually been con-   strued in their fullest scope. Section 29(4) pro-   vides that Parliament may a   Constitution on_a two-thirds majority with a   certificate _of the Speaker. Their Lordships,   however, cannot read the words of s. 29(1) as   entitling Parliament to_pass legislation which   usurps the judicial power of the judicature-e.g.,   by_passing an_act of attainder against some per-   son_or instructing a judge to bring ina verdict   of guilty against some one who is being tried if   inlaw such usurpation would otherwise he con-   trary to the Constitution, There was speculation   during the argument what the position would be   if Parliament sought to procure such a result by   first amending the Constitution by a two-thirds   majority; but such a situation does not arise      here. In so far_as_any Act passed without   recourse to s. 29(4) of the Constitution purports   to usurp or infri the judicial power it is ultra   vires,”   <br>   Now let us turn towards the Constitution of the   United States.      ",
      "278. In the case of Livanage vs R (1967) 1 AC   259 = (1966) 1 All ER 650, although the Constitu-   tion of Ceylon did not expressly vest the Judicial   power exclusively in the Judiciary but the privy   Council found that fact alone was not decisive,   rather. the scheme of the Constitution particularly the   provisions relating to the judiciary, among others, led   the Privy Council to hold that the Constitution vested   the Judicial power exclusively in the Judiciary. This   case furnishes an instance where implied limitations   were inferred. After referring to the provisions with   regard to Judicature, Lord Pearce on behalf of the   Board explains at page - 658 EFG of (1966) 1 AER   650, that these provisions manifest an intention to   secure in the judiciary a freedom from political, leg-   islative and executive control.      ",
      "277. In the result, the Privy council dismissed   the appeal holding that the members of the panel   from which Bribery Tribunal were chosen were not   lawfully appointed to the Tribunal and as such, there   was a conflict between the Constitution of Ceylon      and the Bribery (Amendment) Act.      ",
      "276. Thereafter, Lord Pearce concluded at   page-199G-200C:   <br>   “The legislative power of the Ceylon   Parliament is derived from section 18 and sec-   tion 29 of its Constitution. Section 18 expressly   says “save as otherwise ordered in sub-section   (4) of section 29.” Section 29 (1) is expressed to   be “subject to the provisions of this Order.” And   any power under section 29 (4) is expressly      subject to its proviso. Therefore, in the case of   amendment and repeal _of the Constitution the      Speaker's certificate is a necessary part_of the   legislative process any Bill which does not   comply with the condition precedent of the pro-                         viso, is and remains, even though it receives the   Royal Assent. invalid__and_ultra_vires.      ",
      "275. In dealing with the issue, Lord Pearce   considered the case of Mc Cawley vsThe King 1920   AC 691 at page- 197G — 198F:<br>      ............a legislature has no power to       ignore_the conditions of law-making _that_are   imposed _by the instrument which itself regu-   lates its power to make law. This restriction   exists independently of the question whether   the legislature is sovereign, as is the legislature   of Ceylon, or whether the Constitution is   “uncontrolled,” as the Board held the Constitu-   tion of Queensland to be. .............. In   the present case, on the other hand, the legisla-   ture has purported to pass a law which, being in   conflict with section 55 of the Order in Council,   must be treated, if it is to be valid, as an implied      alteration of the Constitutional provisions about   the appointment of judicial officers. Since such   alterations, even if express, can only be made   by laws which comply with the special legisla-   tive procedure laid down in section 29 (4), the      Ceylon legislature has not got the general   power to legislate so as to amend __its   Constitution by ordinary majority resolutions,      .......            ",
      "274. In respect of the dispute in the case, his   Lordship raised the issue in deciding the question at   page — 196 BC:    <br>  “There remains the point which is the real   substance_of this appeal. When a sovereign      Parliament has purported to enact a bill and it   has received the Royal Assent, is it a valid Act   in the course of whose passing there was a pro-   cedural defect, or is it an_ invalid Act which   Parliament had no power in that _man-   ner      ",
      "273. That is exactly what we are doing in the   instant case in respect of the Proclamations etc, and   its subsequent ratification by the Constitution (Fifth      Amendment) Act.      ",
      "272. In the case of The Bribery Commissioner   vs Pedrick Ranasinghe 1965 AC 172, the Bribery   Tribunal of Ceylon tried and convicted Ranasinghe   on the bribery charges but it was alleged that the   members of the Tribunal were not lawfully appoint-   ed, rather, the provision for appointment offended   against an important safeguard of the Constitution   of Ceylon. The questions before the Privy Council   were as to whether the statutory provisions for the   appointment of members of the panel of the Bribery   Tribunal otherwise than by the Judicial Service   Commission conflict with Section 55 of the   Constitution, and, if so, whether those provisions are   valid.   <br>   Lord Pearce in course of his Judgment observed   at page- 194G:      “The court has _a duty to see that the   Constitution is not infringed and to preserve it   inviolate, Unless, therefore, there is some very   cogent reason for doing so, the court must not   decline to open its eyes to the truth,”      ",
      "271. That is exactly what we intend to do in   this case in considering some of the proclamations   etc. if not all, to find out the pith and substance of   the Fifth Amendment Act.            ",
      "270. Inthe case of Gallagher vs Lynn 1937 AC   86 in deciding the constitutional validity of an Act   passed by the Legislature of Northen Ireland in   1934, Lord Atkin held at pages — 869-70:   <br>   at the “ true nature and character of the leeisla-   tion”: Russell vs The Queen (1) “the pith and   substa nee of the legislation.” If on the view of   the statute as whole, you find that the substance   of the legislationis within the express powers   then it is not invalidated if incidentally it affects   matters which are outside the authorized field.   The legislation must not under the guise of   dealing with one matter in fact encroach upon   the forbidden field, Nor are you to look only al   the object of the legislature. An Act may have a   perfectly lawful object, e.g., to promote the   health of the inhabitants, but may seek to   achieve that object by invalid methods, e.g., 4                      direct prohibition of any trade with a foreign   country. In other words, you may certainly con-   sider the clauses of an Act to see whether they      are_ passed “in respect of” the forbidd sub-   ject.      ",
      "269. This decision is relevant for our purpose   because in every enactment, its pith and substance is   most important. In the above case, the legislation   invaded the civil rights, as such, declared invalid.   Similarly, the pith and substance of the Fifth   Amendment, in the instant case, is sought to ratify   and validate, the Proclamations etc.         ",
      "268. In the case of Attorney-General for   Canada vs Attorney-General For Ontario 1937 AC   355, in deciding the question as to whether the      Employment and Social Insurance Act, 1935, was   ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, Lord Atkin,   in pronouncing the Act ultra vires held at page —      367:   <br>   “ Dominion Legislation, even   though it deals with Dominion property, may   yet be so framed as to invade civil rights within      the province, or encroach upon the classes of   are reserved to Provincial com-   petence      ",
      "267. In this connection we would refer to the   decision of the Privy Council in the case of re The   Regulation And Control of Aeronautics In Canada   1932 AC 54 . In deciding the question regarding the   right of legislation to control and regulate aeronau-   tics and the air-stations in Canada as between the   Dominion and the Provinces, Lord Sankey LC, held   at page-70:   <br>   “      Great care must therefore be taken to consider   each decision in the Jight of the circumstances   of the case in view of which it was pronounced,   especially in the interpretation of an Act such as      the British North America Act, which was a   great constitutional charter, and not to allow   general phrases to obsecure the underlying   object of the Act, which was to establish a sys-   tem of government upon essentially federal   principles. Useful as decided cases are, it is      always advisable to back words of the   Act itself and to remember the object with   which it was passed.      ",
      "266. This decision is relevant for our purpose   because Article 142 of the Constitution of Bangla-                      desh clearly laid down the procedure for amendment   of any provision of the Constitution but Khondaker   Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad   Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahn   in exercise of their autocratic and illegal power,   only made our Constitution subservient to the   Martial Law Proclamations etc. but also changed the   basic structure of the Constitution according to their   free will without caring a fig about the procedure   laid down in the Constitution. Even Article 142   itself was changed illegally, presumably, to impede   further amendment, so that subsequent Parliaments   may not brought back the original provisions of the      Constitution, by way of amendment.            ",
      "265. The importance of this decision lies in the   strict adherence to the procedure spelt out in section   7A of the Constitution Act 1902 . It was intra vires to   section 5 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865   and unless the manner as required in section 7A is   meticulously followed the proposed amendment   could not be made.      ",
      "264. On consideration of the relevant provi-      sions, his Lordship held at page-709-712:   <br>   “Narrow constructions were placed by   colonial judges upon the instruments creating   constitutions in colonial Legislatures. Causes of   friction multiplied, and soon 4 conflict   emerged, analogous to that which is the subject   of discussion to-day, between those who insist-   ed that the constitutions conceded to the   colonies could be modified as easily as any      other Act of Parliament, and those who affirmed   that the statute defining such constitutions was                      “fundamental” or ‘organic“and that therefore,   the_constitution_was_controlled, .......We      observe, therefore, the Legislature in this isolat-   ed section carefully selecting one special and      individual & case in_which_limitations_are   imposed upon the power of the Parliamant of    Queensland to express and carry out its purpose   in the ordinary way, by a bare majority\"      His Lordship concluded at page -714;   <br>   “The Legislature of Queensland is the mas-   ter of its own house hold, except in so far as its   powers have in special cases been restricted. No   such restriction has been established, and none   in fact exists, in such a case as is raised in the   issues now under appeal. It follows, therefore,   that s. 6 of the Industrial Arbitration Act, 1916,   was not ultra vires. The Legislature was fully   entitled to vary the tenure of the judicial office.”   <br>   The importance of Mc Cawley’s case is   that the Privy Council recognized that special   procedure for amendment of the Constitution   Act, 1867, may be made and unless such special   procedure’s are prescribed, amendment of a   provision of the Act may be made in the same   way as any other legislation. This brings fore   the theory of the distinction between the flexi-   ble and the rigid Constitution in actual practice.   <br>   Next we shall consider the case of   Attorney-General for New South Wales vs   Trethowan 1932 AC 526 . In the said case, the   Constitution Act, 1902 of New South Wales,      \" was amended by the Act of 1929, adding sec-      tion 7A. The said provision provided that no bill   to abolish that Legislative Council or repealing   section 7A, should be presented for Royal   Assent until approved by the electors in accor-   dance with that section. But in 1930, without   complying with the requirements of section 7A,   two bills were passed one repealing section 7A   and the other abolishing the Legislative council.   The question arose whether the Parliament of   New South Wales has power to abolish the   Legislative Council of the State, or to alter its      constitution or powers, or to repeal section 7A   of the Constitution Act, 1902, except in the   manner provided by the said section 7A. Lord   Sankey LC, found at page -539-41:   <br>   ............. The question then arises,   could that Bill , a repealing Bill after its passage   through both chambers, be lawfully presented   for the Royal assent_ without having first   received the approval of the electors in the pre-   scribed_manner? In their Lordships’ opinion,      the Bill could not lawfully be so presented. The   proviso in the second sentence of s.5 of the Act   of 1865 states a condition which must be _ful-   filled before the legislature can validly exercise   its power to make the kind of laws which are   referred to in that sentence. In order thats. 7A   may be repealed (in other words, in order that   particular law \"respecting the constitution   powers and procedure” of the “legislature   may be validly made) the law for that purpose      must have bee in the manner required   by s. 7A, a colonial law for the time being in   force in New South Wales.”      Then his Lordship held at page -541:   <br>   “In the result, their Lordships are of opin-   ion that s. 7A of the Constitution Act, 1902, was   valid and was in force when the two Bills under   consideration were passed through the Legis-   lative Council and the Legislative Assembly.      Therefore these Bills could not be presented to   the Governor for His Majesty’s_assent_unless   and_until_a majority of the electors voting had         ",
      "263. In this case, the appointment of Mc   Cawley as a Judge of the Queensland Supreme   Court, under section 6 of the Industrial Arbitration   Act, 1916, passed by Queensland Parliament, was      challenged on the ground that the said provision was   contrary to sections 15 and 16 of the Constitution   Act, 1867 . The challenge was upheld by the   Queensland Supreme Court and the High Court of   Australia, On appeal, the Privy Council reversed the   said decisions. Lord Birkenhead, LC held at page -   703-4:<br>   “The first point which requires considera-   tion depends upon the distinction between con-   stitutions the terms of which may be modified   10 other formality than is nec-   essary in the case of other legislation, and con-   stitutions which can only be altered with some   special formality, and in some cases by a spe-   cially convened assembly.   <br>   .......Thus when one of the learned   judges in the Court below said that, according   to the appellant, the constitution could be   ignored as if'it were a Dog Act, he was in effect   merely expressing his opinion that the constitu-   tion was, in fact, controlled. If it were uncon-   trolled, it would be an elementary common-   place that in the eye of the law the legislative   document or documents which defined it occu   pied precisely the same position as a Dog Act or   any other Act, however humble its subject-mat-   ter.      ",
      "262. This character of the Constitution was   also noted by the Privy Council in the case of Mc   Cawley vs The King 1920 AC 691 . Lord Birkenhead,   LC, recognised a distinction between a rigid and   flexible Constitution. He, however, termed it as con-   trolled and uncontrolled Constitution.      ",
      "261. In re The Initiative and Referendum Act   1919 AC 935, in considering the validity of the Act   passed by the Legislature of Manitoba, Viscount   Haldane, held at page -943-5:   <br>                “The references their Lordships have   already made to the character of the office of   Licutenant-Governor, and to his position as   directly representing the Sovereign in. the   province, renders natural the exclusion of his   office from the power conferred on the   Provincial Legislature to amend the constitu-      tion of the Province.   <br>   ..... in accoedance with the analogy   of the British Constitution which the Act of   1867 adopts, the Lieutenant-Governor who rep-   resents the Sovereign is a part of the   Legislature.......It follows that if the   Initiative and Referendum Act has purported to   alter the position of the Lieutenant-Governor in   these respects, this Act was in_so_far_ultra   Vires.......... users Thus the _Licutenant-   Governor appears to be wholly excluded from   the new legislative authority. These considera-   tions are sufficient to establish the_ultra vires   character_ of the Act. The ending provisions   are in their Lordships’ view so interwoven into   the scheme that they are not_severable. The   Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865(1), therefore,   which was invoked in the course of the argu-   ment, does not assist the appellants.” (The   underlinings are mine)   <br>   The above Act envisaged removal of the   Lieutenant-Governor of the Province from par-   ticipation in the provincial legislative process,   contrary to section 9 of the British North   America Act, as such the said Initiative and   Referendum Act was held invalid.      ",
      "260. In 1867 the desire of Canada for a defi-   nite Constitution the embracing the entire Dominion   was embodied in the British North America Act.   Now, there can be no doubt that under this organic   instrument the powers distributed between the   Dominion on the one hand and the provinces on the   other hand cover the whole area of self -government   within the whole area of Canada. It would be sub-   versive of the entire scheme and policy of the Act to   assume that any point of internal self-government   was withheld from Canada.”<br>      His Lordship further held at page — 583:<br>      “In the interpretation of a completely self-   governing Constitution founded upon a written   organic instrument, such as the British North   America Act, if the text is explicit the text is      conclusive, alike in what it directs and what it   forbids, When the text_is ambiguous, as, for   example, when the words establishing two   mutually exclusive jurisdictions are wide      enough to bring a_particular_power within   either, recourse must be had to the context and   scheme of the Act. Again, if the text says noth-   ing expressly, then it is not _to_be presumed   that the Constitution withholds the power allo-   gether, On the contrary, it is to be_taken_tor   granted that the power is bestowed in some   quarter unless it be extraneous to the statute   itself (as, for example, a power to make laws for   some part of His Majesty's dominions outside   of Canada) or other wise is clearly repugnant to   its sense, For whatever belongs to self-govern-   ment in Canada belongs either to the Dominion   or to the provinces, within the limits of the   British North America Act.”   <br>   (The underlinings are mine)      ",
      "259. The basic principles of construction of a      Constitution were enunciated by Earl Loreburn   L.C., in the case of Attorney-General for Ontario V.   Attorney-General for Canada 1912 AC 571 at page   — 581:<br>      “The real point raised in this most impor-   tant case is whether or not an Act of the   Dominion Parliament authorizing questions   either of law or of fact to be put to the Supreme   Court and requiring the judges of that Court to   answer them on the request of the Governor in   Council is a valid enactment within the powers      that Parliament. Much care and learning have   been devoted to the case, and their Lordships   are under a deep debt to all the learned judges   who have delivered their opinions upon this   anxious controversy.      ",
      "258. In this connection the discussion of AV   Dicey in his celebrated work ‘An Introduction to the   Study of the Law of the Constitution’ (10th Edition)   at pages 146 -150 is illuminating:   <br>   “The constitution must be what | have   termed a “rigid” or “inexpensive” constitution.   <br>   The law of the constitution must be either      legally immutable, or_else_capable_of being   changed only by some authority above and   beyond the ordinary legislative bodies, whether      federal or state legislatures, existing under the   constitution,<br>      In spite of the doctrine enunciated by some   jurists that in every country there must be found   some person or body legally capable of chang-   ing every institution thereof, .---------- The ques-                    tion, however, Whether a federal constitution   necessarily involves the existence of some ulti-   mate sovereign power authorised to amend or   alter its terms is of merely speculative interest,   for under existing federal governments the con-   stitution Will be found to provide the means for   its OWN improvement............. Under a   federal as under a unitarian system there exists   a sovereign power, but the sovereign is in a fed-   eral state a despot hard to rouse. He is not, like   > English Parliament_ever-wakeful legislator   but a monarch  who slumbers and sleeps,   The sovereign of the United States has been   roused to serious action but once during the   course of more than a century. It needed the   thunder_of the Civil War break his repose,   and it may be doubted whether anything short   of impending revolution will ever again arouse   him to activity. But_a monarch who slumbers   for years is like a monarch who does not exist.   A federal constitution is capable  of change, but   for all that_a federal constitution is apt to be   unchangeable.<br>      Every legislative assembly existing under a      federal constitution is merely a subordinate   law-making body, whose laws are of the nature   of by-laws, valid whilst within the authority   conferred upon _it by the constitution, but      invalid or unconstitutional if they go beyond      limits of such authority.”      ",
      "257. People of many a modern countries has   got a say in the Constitutions of their countries and   so also in its amendments, as such, provisions are   made in the Constitutions of the Republic of Ireland,   Denmark, Commonwealths of Australia,   Switzerland and the States of the United States, pro-   viding for referring the proposed amendments to the   people, after it has been passed by the legislatures.   This highlights the sovereignty of the people.      ",
      "256. In framing a Constitution, the will of the   ‘people’ of the concerned Republic is the most   important factor. Although as a matter of fact, the   people never frames a Constitution but the   Constitution must, of necessity, reflects their ideals,   their hopes their aspirations in general, otherwise, it   will not come from the people, rather it would tan-   tamount to imposing upon them, necessitating   enactment and adoption of one Constitution after   another. In the language of K.C. Wheare in the   ‘Modern Constitutions’ at page - 67:   <br>   “CONSTITUTIONS, when they are   framed and adopted, tend to reflect the domi-   nant beliefs and interests, or some compromise   between conflicting beliefs and interests, which   are characteristic of the society at that time.   Moreover, they do not necessarily reflect polit-   ical or legal beliefs and interests only, They   may embody conclusions or compromises upon   economic and social matters which the framers   of the Constitution have wished to guarantee or      to proclaim. A Constitution is indeed the result-   ant of a parallelogram of forces political, eco-   nomic and social-which operate at the time of   its adoption” <br>      As such, when a Constitution is framed it com-   mands veneration and highest respect from all   because, il is the supreme law of the land and the   Government and all other Institutions are subordi-   nate to the Constitution. The people in that view of   the matter regards their Constitution as their guaran-   tee of their own rights, duties and obligations   towards the state and vice versa, as such, they would   regard it as their own Constitution. Generally the   people would not like any unilateral lighthearted   attempt to change the Constitution, rather, would   like to preserve it against all odds even against a   usurper.      ",
      "255. So far a rigid Constitution is concerned,   we first think about the Constitution of the United   States. The United States has a written Constitution,   one of the earliest. Besides, special procedure has   been provided for amendment of the said Constitu-   tion. Similarly most of the European and American   Constitutions are rigid. The only exceptions as could   be gathered, are the Constitutions of Singapore and   New-Zealand. Those Constitutions, though written   but can be altered by ordinary legislative process so   also the Constitutions of the Australian States which   are written but largely flexible.      ",
      "254. By way of example of flexible   Constitution, United Kingdom may be cited as one.   Firstly because there is no written Constitution   being the supreme law, creating the Parliament or   other Institutions of the State. Secondly, there is no   distinction between the status of various laws enact-   ed by the Queen in Parliament. Thirdly, amendment   of any law can be made by the Iegislature without   any special procedure as in the case of a written      rigid Constitution.      ",
      "253. As such, of necessity some special strin-   gent procedure is provided for in the Constitution   itself to allow such an amendment, This however,   depends whether the constitution is a ‘flexible* one   or ‘rigid’. If the provision of the Constitution can be   changed with the same ease as that of an ordinary   law it is known as a flexible Constitution but when   the Constitution provides some special procedure   for the amendment of its provisions then it is known   as a rigid Constitution.                         ",
      "252. Incontradistinction to the amendment of   an ordinary legislation, Constitutions of most of the   countries provide for special procedure for amend-   ment of any provision of the Constitution. The rea-   son is and it is generally accepted that a C onstitution   is a fundamental or basic law of a country. It is being   the supreme law and when it is written, it is to be   treated as permanent. But it also acknowledged that   with the passage of time, the needs of the people, the   needs of the society as a whole may require re-   adjustment of some of the provisions of the Cons-   titution, keeping its basis and basics intact. In order   to provide such a mechanism, a provision for   amendment is invariably kept in the Constitution   itself,      ",
      "251. Letus first consider the general principle   with regard to the power of amendment of the   Constitution. Thereafter, we shall consider Article   142 of the Constitution of Bangladesh which con-   fers such power of amendment on the Parliament   and the Parliament alone.      ",
      "250. In May, 1977, in pursuance of the   Referendum Order, 1977 (MLO No.1! of 1977), a         Referendum was held and almost all the voters in   Bangladesh expressed their confidence in Major   General Ziaur Rahman, BU psc, and in his policies   and programmes. In due course, a general election   was held in 1979 and the Second Parliament was   commenced on April 1, 1979, although the Martial   Law was still continuing in Bangladesh. On the   April 6, 1979, as a sequel to the promulgation of   Martial Law, the Constitution (Fifth Amendment)   Act, 1979 was made by the Parliament and pub-   lished in Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary on April   7, 1979.      ",
      "249. Under the above noted Proclamations, a   couple of hundred MLRs and MLOs were made   from time to time to suit the needs of the usurpers,   since the promulgation of the Martial Law on   August 20, 1975, till it was withdrawn on April 7,   1979, All those MLRs and MLOs were also ratified   and validated by the Fifth Amendment, passed on      April 6, 1979.      Part XXII   Amendment of The Constitution      ",
      "248. Not only the Proclamations but also   Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Order   made under the various Proclamations, were also   ratified and validated.      ",
      "247. The main features of these changes of   the Constitution are:   <br>   (i) | These changes were made by a nomi-   nated President and CMLA—who had   no legislative power either to make a   law or abrogate any, not to speak of   any of the provision of the Constitu-      tion but it was done.   <br>   (ii) Votes of not less than two-thirds of the   total number of members of Parlia-                               ment is required to amend a provision   of the Constitution. No — Parliament   was in existence, on the said date on   April 23, 1977, but without following   the above noted procedure, as stipu-   lated in Article 142, the changes in   various provisions of the Constitution   were made by the above noted   Proclamation Order.   <br>   (iii) The above noted insertion and substi-   tution of provisions, among others,   made in the Constitution, changed its   basic character, as such, could not   even be done by the two-thirds of the   total number of members of the   Parliament.         <br>   (iv)The Constitution was made sub-   servient to the Proclamations, MLRs   and MLOs.      <br>      This is no amendment of the Constitution even   in the plane eyes, but destruction of the basic char-   acter of the Constitution by a Proclamation Order   issued by the CMLA. But the Second Parliament   ratified and validated the said Proclamation Order   No.1 of 1977 by the Fifth Amendment.      ",
      "246. This Proclamation Order changing the   Constitution, was made by the President and the   CMLA by amendment of the Proclamation dated   November 8, 1975 and November 29, 1976, read   with the Proclamation of August 20, 1975.      ",
      "245. The Fourth Schedule was added to vali-   date the transitional and temporary provisions made   since the declaration of independence on March 26,   1971 till 16th December, 1972, when the   Constitution became effective. But this paragraph   3A was added to validate all the proclamations made   since August 20, 1975 with amendments and all   other acts, actions, MLRs and MLOs and proceed-   irigs taken thereunder till the date when the Martial   Law would be withdrawn.      ",
      "244. It should also be noted that in pursuance   to the Order dated April 21, 1977, Major General   Ziaur Rahman, BU psc, must have taken the follow-   ing oath before entering the office of President:   <br>   The English text is :  <br>    “I, The President.-An oath (or affirmation)   in the following form shall be administered by   the Chief Justice. (after amendment by   Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed by his Procla-   mation dated August 20, 1975):      “I................., do solemnly swear (or affirm)   that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the   office of President of Bangladesh according to   law :   <br>   That I will bear true faith and allegiance to   Bangladesh:   <br>      That I will preserve , protect and defend the Constitution<br>   And that I will do right to all manner of   people according to law, without fear or favour,      affection or ill — will. ..........      ”      (The underlinings are mine)   <br>   But only 2(two) days later, on April 23, 1977.   ations (Amendment) Order, 1977   (Proclamation Order No.1 of 1977) (Annexure-L-1).   extensive changes by way of amendment was made   which not only changed the Constitution but      defaced it beyond recognition.   <br>         Besides, Paragraph 3A was inserted after      Paragraph 3, in the Fourth schedule to the      Constitution.      ",
      "243. Besides, Major General Ziaur Rahman,      BU psc, being appointed as the Chief of Army Staff      on the August 22, 1975, by Khandaker Moshtaque   Ahmed, was still in the active service in the   Republic of Bangladesh, when he entered the office   of the President. It should be noted that by virtue of   his office as President, the Supreme Command of   the defence services, of Bangladesh was vested in   him but at the same time he was a servant of the   Republic as the Chief of Army Staff.      ",
      "242. We have already stated above that a   proclamation is not a law and by proclamation nei-   ther a law can be made nor a law can be abrogated   not to speak of the provisions of the Constitution. As   such, the First Proclamation along with clause aa is   non-est in the eye of law and the nominations of   both Justice Sayem and Major General Ziaur   Rahman BU psc, as President were in total violation   of the Constitution, without jurisdiction and without      lawful authority.                      ",
      "241. It is amazing that when even a chairman   of a Union Council has to be elected and can not be   nominated, nomination could be made to the highest   office of the Republic and even that was done by a   Proclamation. This is a disgrace and insult to the   Nation-hood of Bangladesh. But this insult was rat-   ified by the Second Parliament in the Constitution      (Fifth Amendment) Act.      ",
      "240. The office of President has been created   by Article 48 of the Constitution. The qualification   and election to the office of President has been stip-   ulated in the said provision. But there is no provi-   sion for nomination to the office of President in the   entire Constitution. From the language of the Order   dated April 21, 1977, it appears that this provision of   nomination was added by clause (aa) to the First   Proclamation by subsequent amendment.      ",
      "239. From the Order dated April 21, 1977, we   could learn that Justice Sayem became President of   Bangladesh on being nominated by Khondaker   Moshtaque Ahmed. Justice Sayem similarly nomi-   nated Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU psc, as the   next President of Bangladesh.      ",
      "238. Subsequently, Justice Sayem nominated   Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc, to be the   President of Bangladesh and also handed over the   office of President to him.      ",
      "237. In due course, Justice Sayem by the   Third Proclamation, handed over the office of   Martial Law Administrator to Major General Ziaur   Rahman, BU, psc, to act as the CMLA,      ",
      "236. But the Second Parliament, by the   Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, ratified all his   such illegal functions and actions.         ",
      "235. We ourselves tried to probe but could not   find any. The Constitution or any other law did not   provide so. Besides, the concept of Martial Law is   totally absent in our Constitution or in any other law   or jurisprudence. The Constitution, the supreme law   of the country, does not provide it nor any other law   of our country. There is no place or office of CMLA   in our jurisprudence. Obviously, the then Chief   Justice of Bangladesh, completely ignored these   legal realities for reasons best known to him but for   that reason his taking over as the President of   Bangladesh and assumption of the powers of CMLA   would not become legal. Even a Chief Justice is not   above the law. He is accountable for all his actions   just like the humblest citizen of this country. He   betrayed his oath to preserve, protect and defend the   Constitution. He was obliged to do it with his life   but he failed miserably. As a citizen, under Article      21, it was his duty to observe the Constitution, the’      laws and to maintain discipline but he failed, We   find that his such actions were beyond the ambit of   the Constitution and the ordinary laws of the land,   As such, he was a usurper to the office of President   of Bangladesh and his assumption of the powers of   CMLA, a legally non-existent office, was void and   non-est in the eye of law. Consequently, all his sub-   sequent actions taken by way of amendment of the   Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, MLRs,   MLOs and Ordinance, issued from time to time   being beyond the ambit of the Constitution, were   also all illegal, void ab initio and non est.      ",
      "234. On our query as to how and under what   Jaw Justice Sayem, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh,   could take over as the President of Bangladesh and   also assumed the powers of CMLA, the learned   Additional Attomey-General was without any answer.      ",
      "233. Justice Sayem remained CMLA ull   November 29, 1976 and resigned from the office of                         President on April 21, 1977, During this time, a   huge number of MLRs and MLOs were issued.   Besides, various provisions of the Constitution were   amended from time to time by amendment of the   Second Proclamation.      ",
      "232. Earlier, although Martial Law was   clamped on the country since August 15, 1975 but   apparently no Martial Law Administrator was   appointed but this time Justice Sayem by the   Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, made some   modifications in the earlier proclamation and also   appointed the Chief of Army Staff, Major General   Ziaur Rahman BU psc; the Chief of Naval Staff.   Commodore MH Khan, PSN, BN and the Chief of   Air Staff, Air Vice Martial MG Tawab SJ, SBt, PSA,   BAF, as Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators.      ",
      "231. The office of CMLA is a relic from the   past. In the erstwhile Pakistan, General Ayub Khan   was appointed CMLA by the Proclamation dated   October 7, 1958 and again General Yahya Khan   declared himself as the CMLA on March 25, 1969.      ",
      "230. This narration of the events may not be      absolutely accurate but the real facts may never be   known and in any case not very necessary for decid-   ing the legal issues involved in this Tule but stated   only as a sequel leading to the assumption of office      of President by Justice Sayem. But how and what   chain of events led the Chief Justice of Bangladesh   to become not only the President of Bangladesh but   also the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA).   is far from clear. But in any case he was there as the   President of Bangladesh and the CMLA as apparent   from the Proclamation dated November 8, 1975.      ",
      "229. The ‘reign’ of Khandaker Moshtaque   Ahmed lasted for 82 (eighty two) days. On   November 6, 1975 he handed over the office of   President of Bangladesh to Justice Abu Sadat   Mohammad Sayem. The history and the reasons      which led Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed to abdicate   in favour of Justice Sayem were not explained to us   with any details. All we could gather from the sub-   missions made by the learned Advocates and their   written arguments that there was a coup and a count-   er coup during the first week of November. 1975.   the chain of command in the Army in Dhaka   Cantonment broke down, large sections of Army   personnel revolted leading to the whole-sale killing   of a large number of officers of the Army. Colonel   Taher rescued Major General Ziaur Rahman BU.pse   the Chief of Army Staff, from his residence in the   Cantonment.      ",
      "228. But the Second Parliament by the   Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, ratified their   such actions, such as, illegal changing of the   Constitution without any authority, suspension of   the Constitution, ousting the jurisdiction of the   Supreme Court, etc.      ",
      "227. We repeatedly enquired about any legal   basis for such seizure of office of President but   received no satisfactory answer from the learned   Additional Attomey-General. Apparently, Khanda-   ker Mostaque Ahmed with the active aid and assis-   tance of a section of the Armed Forces, grabbed the   office of President and the Government of   Bangladesh. All these were done on August 15,   1975 . Five days later, on the 20th August, the   Proclamation was made, declaring Martial Law in   the country. By the Proclamation, the Constitution,   the supreme law of the country, was suspended and   the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was ousted.   We along with the learned Additional Attorney-   General and other leamed Advocates for the peti-   tioner as well as the respondent No.3, searched for   any semblance of legal basis for all these actions but   could not find any. It appears that Khandaker   Moshtaque Ahmed along with his conspirators sim-   ply seized the Government by the muzzle of the   guns. They grossly violated the Constitution. They   were usurpers plane and simple.      ",
      "226. During normal times, everything is gen-   erally routine and rational but it is the time of crisis   which puts a nation and its people on test. On the   morning of August 15, 1975, we failed to uphold the   Constitution and the laws made thereunder inspite   of our oath. It remained in the book not in our hearts.      ",
      "225. It appears that on the early morning of   August 15, 1975, Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed   merrily changed the Constitution of Bangladesh and   seized the office of President although without any   legal authority. All the other Commanding Officers   of the Armed Forces readily declared their alle-   giance to the new ‘President’ and his ‘Government’                         apparently without any protest although on their   commission as officers, they all took oath to be   faithful to Bangladesh and its Constitution and bear   true allegiance to the President.      ",
      "224. The Proclamation dated August 20, 1975   was made by Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed, a   Minister in the Cabinet of the Government of   Bangladesh. As a Minister, he had specific functions   under the Constitution but by any stretch of imagi-   nation, it did not authorize him to seize the oflice of   President of Bangladesh. No authority or legal pro-   vision has been mentioned in the Proclamation jus-   tifying his such assumption of power.      ",
      "223. But by proclamations, laws cannot be   made and in all the Constitutions of the civilized   world the power to legislate is always with the con-   cerned legislative body or authority as spelt out in   the respective Constitutions.      ",
      "222. Another example of proclamation is the   declaration of Independence on March 26, 1971,   followed by the formal Proclamation of Indepen-   dence of Bangladesh itself made on July 10, 1971, at   Mujibnagar, made on behalf of the Constituent   Assembly. This proclamation ushered the birth of a   new nation, our People’s Republic of Bangladesh.   The first paragraph of the Preamble of our   Constitution also recognized such proclamation of   Independence on March 26, 1971.      ",
      "221. The Declaration of Independence adopt-   ed on July 4, 1776, by the Continental Congress of   the Colonies was also a proclamation. It announced   the birth of a new nation of the United States.      ",
      "220. Halsbury’s Laws of England (Fourth   Edition Vol. 8) describes Royal Proclamation in this   manner:   <br>   “1098 . Use of proclamations, Proclama-   tions may be legally used to call attention to the   provisions of existing laws, or to make or alter   regulations over which the Crown has a discre-   tionary authority, either at common law or by   statute. Thus, the Crown may by proclamation   summon or dissolve Parliament, declare war or   peace, and promulgate blockades and lay   embargoes on shipping in time of war,.,..,      1099 . Restrictions on proclamations.   Under the general rule which restrains the   Crown from legislating apart from Parliament,   it is well-settled law that the Sovereign’s   proclamation, unless authorized in that behalf         by statute, cannot enact any new law, of make   provisions contrary to old ones      <br>      In modern times, the purpose of a Royal   Proclamation was confined and restricted to notify   the existing law but can neither make law nor abro-   gate any.      ",
      "219. King James | asked Sir Edward Coke,   Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, his opinion about   the right of the Kings to issue proclamations. To his   such query, Chief Justice Coke, Chief Justice   Fleming, Chief Baron Tanfield and Baron Altham   delivered their opinion thus :   <br>   “The King cannot create any offence which   was not an offence before, for then he may alter   the law of the land in his proclamation in some      high point... ~The Law of England is divided   into three parts; the common law, statue law,   and custom; but the King's proclamation is   none of these... The king has no prerogrative   but that which the law of the land allows him\"      (The underlinings are mine). (Reported in 2   State Tr 726, Quoted from Halsbury’s Laws of   England, Fourth Edition, Vol. 8, note-3 to Para-   1099).   <br>   Their such bold opinion four hundred years ago   in ]610 could give a check to the arbitrary exercise   of power by the Crown, but four hundred years later,   the learned Additional Attorney-General of   Bangladesh, contended that the Judges of the   Supreme Court of Bangladesh, are not entitled to   say so in respect of the Fifth Amendment Act, since   there was an ouster clause.      ",
      "218. In those ancient days the Monarchs used   to rule by divine right but by 17th century it was   established that the source of the Regal power was   the common law of the land.                      ",
      "217. During ancient times proclamations   were a source of law in England. King Henry the   VIII (1509-1547) used to assert his power to make   laws by way of proclamations. By the Statute of   1539, the King could legislate by Proclamations   without Parliament. This Act was, however,   repealed during the reign of Edward VI (1547-   1553), Still Mary I (1553-1558) and Elizabeth |   (1558-1603) used proclamations, but much less fre-   quently than their father.      ",
      "216. Let us first consider what is a proclama-   tion. The meanings given in the Chambers   Dictionary are ‘an official notice given to the pub-   lic’, ‘a proscription’ etc. According to Black’s Law   Dictionary proclamation means ‘a formal public   announcement made by the government.’ Generally   proclamations are used for declarations of war and   peace made on behalf of the Sovereign or the   Republic.      ",
      "215. We have already narrated above the   Proclamations dated August 20, 1975, November 8.   1975 and also November 29, 1976.      ",
      "214. Since clause (O) of this Proclamation      bestowed the President with such power which   sought to subordinate the Constitution. the said   clause (O) is invalid, void and ultra vires to the      Constitution.      Part XXI   Proclamations      ",
      "213. It may be noted that Paragraph 18 in the   Fourth Schedule of the Constitution, inserted by the      Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, ratified,   confirmed and validated all proclamations, among   others, made during the period from August 15.   1975 to April 9, 1979 . As such, the Proclamation   published on April 7, 1979, also stood ratified. con-   firmed and validated, including the aforementioned   ‘supra Constitutional’ power of the President.      ",
      "212. This was all very good but in the course   of narrating the directions, it again sought to subor-   dinate the Constitution when clause (O) of the   Proclamation divulged that the President may make      any order ‘notwithstanding anything contained in   the Constitution’. The President does not have any   such power ‘notwithstanding anything contained in   the Constitution’ either now or at any time since   December 16, 1972, still, this Proclamation   bestowed such ‘supra Constitutional’ power on the   then President of Bangladesh.      ",
      "211. This Proclamation was published in   Bangladesh Gazette, Extra-ordinary on April 7,   1979, It proclaims the following :   <br>   (i) In the interest of peace, order, securily,   progress, prosperity and development,   Bangladesh was placed under Martial   Law on August 15, 1975.   <br>   (ii) The said Martial Law stood withdrawn   on and from April 6, 1979 at 8-00 pm.   <br>   (iii) The Proclamations were revoked and the   MLRs and MLOs stood repealed from   the above date and time.      But,   <br>   (iv) The President may, to remove any diffi-   culty, make any provisions notwith-   standing anything contained in the   Constitution or any other law for the   time being in force.   <br>   This was possibly the last proclamation issued   by the Chief Martial Law Administrator.   <br>   It appears that the Parliament was already in   session and the Constitution (Fifth Amendment)   Act, 1979 had already been enacted and was pub-   lished in Bangladesh Gazette on April 6, 1979.   <br>   Although this Proclamation frankly gave the   reasons for imposing Martial Law on August 15,   1975 and also revoked the Martial Law.      ",
      "210. However, Article 92A was omitted by   Section 10 of the Constitution (Twelfth Amend-   ment) Act, 1991 (Act XXVIII of 1991). By this   amendment the Parliamentary form of Government   was restored, but the supervisory power of the   Supreme Court as given in the original Constitution.   over the Subordinate Judiciary was not restored. Il   remained with the Executive. That much of the   Fourth Amendment was not disturbed yet, as if, thal   was another piece of ‘democratic principle’ which   required to be kept intact.                         Part XX (O)   Proclamation dated April 6, 1979   <br>   [Published in the Bangladesh Gazette,   Extraordinary, dated the 7th April, 1979]      GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUB-   LIC OF BANGLADESH   OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MARTIAL LAW   ADMINISTRATOR   PROCLAMATION      WHEREAS in the interest_of Peace, order,   security, progress, prosperity and development      of the country the whole of Bangladesh was   placed under Martial Law on the 15th August,   1975;   <br>   AND Wuereas the situation in the country in   all respects has since improved, and all the   authorities and institutions in the country may   now properly function in accordance with the   Constitution and the law;   <br>   AND WHEREAS I, Lieutenant General Ziaur   Rahman, BU, having been elected as President   of Bangladesh under the Constitution in the elec-   tion held on 3rd June, 1978, have already entered   upon the office of President;   <br>   AND WHEREAS a Parliament has also been   elected under the Constitution and it is in session   now;   <br>   AND WHEREAS further continuance of   Martial Law is no longer necessary in the nation-   al interest and it needs be withdrawn;   <br>   AND WHEREAS for the said purpose it is now   necessary to revoke the Proclamations of the   20th August, 1975, and 8th November, 1975,   and the Third Proclamation of the 29th   November, 1976, and to repeal all Martial Law   Regulations an Martial Law Orders, and to make   provisions consequential and incidental thereto:   <br>   Now, THEREFORE in pursuance of the Third   Proclamation of the 29th November. 1976, read   with the Proclamations of the 20th August, 1975,      and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise of all   powers enabling me in that behalf, 1, Lieutenant   General Ziaur Rahman, BU, President of   Bangladesh and Chief Martin Law Administrator,   do hereby declare and direct as follows:   <br>   (a) at 8-00 PM on the 6th day of April.   1979, hereinafter referred to as the      commencing day, Martial Law   declared on the 15th August, 1975   shall stand withdrawn and the   Proclamations of the 20th August,   1975, and 8th November, 1975, and      the Third Proclamation of the 29th   November, 1976, together with all   other Proclamations and Orders   amending or supplementing them,   hereinafter referred to as the said   Proclamations, shall stand revoked:   <br>   (b) all Martial Law amd regulations and    Martil Law Orders made in pur-   suance of the said Proclamations, and      in force immediately before the com-      mencing day, shall stand repealed on   the commencing day........;   <br>   (0) the President may, for the purpose of   removing any difficulty that may   arise in giving effect to any provision   of this Proclamation make, by order,   such provisions as he deems neces-   sary or expedient and every such   order shall have effect notwithstand-   ing anything thine contained in the   Constitution or in any other law for   the time being in force.      DACCA;   <br>   The 6th April, 1979(0)   ZIAUR RAHMAN, BU,   <br>   Lieutenant General<br>   President and<br>   Chief Martial Law Administrator.   <br>   (The underlinings are mine)                      ",
      "209. It is surprising that although the Fourth   Amendment was dismantled brick by brick but the   office of the President was kept very much intact.   More surprise, by inserting Article 92A by the above   Order, the Parliament was made subservient to the   President, at the apex of the power, for all practical   purposes, because in an unlikely event, even if the   Parliament refuses to pass the budget, under the new   provision, the President without any worries about   the funds could dissolve the Parliament at his pleas-   ure. In this way the President of Bangladesh in 1978   became the most powerful Chief Executive in the   world virtually without any checks and balances   either from the Parliament or from any body else   which would have envied even by Oliver Cromwell,   the Lord Protector of England in 1653.      ",
      "208. Thereafter, the President and the CMLA, further repealed the Constitution by the Second    Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978   (Second Proclamation Order No. 1V of 1978).      The preamble of the said Order reads as fol-   lows:   <br>   “Whereas there has been persistent   demand for the repeal of the undemocratic pro-   visions of the Constitution incorporated therein   by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act,   1975;   <br>   AND Whereas some of such undemocrat-      ic provisions have already been repealed by the   President the Chief Martial Law      Administrator;   <br>   AND Wuereas the President and the Chief   Martial Law Administrator, in response to the      said popular demand, pledged to the nation to   repeal the remaining undemocratic provisions      after obtaining mandate from the people in the   election to the office of President, and he has      obtained that mandate;      <br>      AND Whereas it is expedient further to   amend the Proclamation of the 8th November,   1975, for the purposes of fulfilling the said   pledge and other purposes hereinafter appear-   ing;   <br>   Now, therefore, in pursuance to the Third   Proclamation of the 29th November, 1976, read   with the Proclamations of the 20th August,   1975, and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise   of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the   President and the Chief Martial Law   Administrator is pleased to make the following   Order .....   (The underlinings are mine)   <br>   It appears that by the said Order although the   most of the “undemocratic” provisions of the Fourth   Amendment were removed but the Presidential sys-   tem remained in tact, as if that was the only demo-   cratic principle in the Fourth Amendment so much   so that Article 92A was also inserted to make the   already powerful President more powerful. Earlier   even after the Fourth Amendment, no fund would      have been available to the President without having   the budget passed by the Parliament. But Article   92A unilaterally authorized the President to with-   draw money from the Consolidated Fund for a peri-   od of 120 days even without the approval of the   Parliament so that the President after dissolving a   dissident Parliament might elect a new Parliament.   Even James | or Charles I in early 17th Century did   not have such power in violation of the provisions of   Magna Carta. Lieutenant-General Oliver Cromwell   even purged the Parliament but could not get the   badly needed funds from the Commons for his army.      ",
      "207. By the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 (Second Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977) the Supreme Court was again made to consist of the Appellate Division and the High Court Division, with effect from December 1, 1977, with other ancillary amendments.

      "206. The Abandoned Properties (Supplemen- tary Provisions) Regulation, 1977, was made by the MLR No. VII of 1977 . This was published in the Bangladesh Gazette, Extraordinary dated 7th October, 1977 (Annexure-L).  ~ The MLR VII of 1977 was under consideration in the case of Halima Khatun vs Bangladesh 30 DLR (SC) 219 . Fazle Munim, J.(as his Lordship then was) very crudely depicted the correct picture of the said Regulation, His Lordship held at para-18:  “Under_the Proclamation which contains fhe aforesaid clauses the Constitution has lost  Its _character as Suprem law of the  country.......The present Constitutional provi- sion may, however, claim superiority to any law   other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation.”  At para-19, his Lordship further held: <br> “On reference to Clause (g) of the Proclamation of August 20, 1975, it is seen that no Court including the Supreme Court has any power to call in question in any manner what- soever or declare illegal or void the Proclamation or any Regulation or Order  His Lordship finally concluded at para-20: <br> “In consequence of these express provi-  sions jt w merel cking one's head against a stone wall if, one makes an attempt to et redress in a Court of law which, previous to this Regulation, might have granted relief if one could show that one's property  did not come  within the purview of the abandoned Property  Order.” (the underlinings are mine) <br> With great respect for the learned Judge we would acclaim that his Lordship very aptly depicted the inhuman face of the MLR. <br> Same kind of conclusions can be drawn in respect of other MLRs and MLOs.    Part XX (M) Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977     ",
      "205. In continuation of these kinds of Procla- mations, The referendum Order. 1977, was made by the Martial Law Order No.l of 1977, in order to ascertain the confidence of the people in the President and the CMLA. This MLO was published in the Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary on the Ist May, 1977 . The preamble of the MLO reads as fol-  lows:<br> THE REFERENDUM ORDER, 1977 <br> Martial Law Order No.1 of 1977. <br> WHEREAS, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator in his address to the Nation on the 22nd April, 1977, declared that, to ascertain the confidence of the people in him and in the policies and programmes enunciated by him, a countrywide referendum would be held on the 30th May, 1977, on the basis of direct adult franchise; <br> And whereas it is necessary to provide for the conduct of the said referendum; <br> Now, therefore, in pursuance of the Third Proclamation of the 29th November, 1976, read with the Proclamations of the 20th August, 1975, and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator in pleased to make the following Martial Law Order :    paragraph 2(f) defines the word ‘referen- dum’in this manner:<br> (f) “referendum™ means the referendum held under this Order. <br> paragraph 3 mentions the question for ref-  erendum: <br> «3 . Question for referendum.—There shall be held on the 30th May, 1977, in accor- gance with the provisions of this Order, a refer- endum on the question whether or not the vot- ers have confidence in President Major General Ziaur Rahman, B.U. and in the policies and pro- grammes enunciated by him. <br> On consideration of this MLO it appears: <br> (i) The referendum was conceived and con- ducted under the MLO No.1 of 1977, <br> (ii) This was done in order to ascertain the confidence of the voters in President Major General Ziaur Rahman, <br> (iii) This kind of referendum is unknown to the Constitution, or any law of the land.

      "640. Now let us test the constitutionality of the Constitution (fifth amendment) Act, 1979 . This amendment Act sought to legalise the following among others : <br> (i) The seizure of office of President of Bangladesh by Khondaker Moshta- que Ahmed on August 15, 1975. <br> (ii) Change of Article 48, 55 and 142 of the constitution by Khondaker  Moshtaque Ahmed. <br> (iii) proclamation of Martial Law <br> (iv)Made the Constitution subordinate and subservient to the Proclamation of Martial Law. <br> (v) Ousted the jurisdiction of Court including the Supreme court <br> (vi)Nomination of Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem as President of Bangladesh on November 6, 1975 <br> (vii)Proclamation issued on November 8, 1975, and assumption of the powers of Chief Martial Law Administrator, <br> (viii) Dissolution of the National Assembly <br> (ix) Omission of the Bangladesh Colla- borators (Special Tribunal) Order, 1972,       <br> (x) Deletion of proviso to Article 38 of the Constitution, <br> (xi) Deletion of the amendments made by the Fourth Amendment of the Consti- tution, save and except the provisions in respect of the office of the President, the control and discipline of Subordinate Courts and also Article 116A. <br> (xii)Proclamation dated November, 1976, appointing Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc, the Chief of Army Staff, as the Chief Martial Law Administrator, <br> (xiii) Various Proclamation Orders, Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders <br> (xiv) Nomination of Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc., as the President of Bangladesh by an Order dated April 21, 1977. <br> (xv)Change of the Preamble and Article 6, &, 9, 10, 11, 25, 42, 93 and 142 of the Constitution and addition of Article 92A therein. <br> (xvi) Paragraph 3A to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, legalising all Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the actions taken thereon, which were kept out side the jurisdiction of the Court, <br> (xvii) The Referendum Order, 1977 (Martial Law Order No. | of 1977) dated May 1, 1977 and various other Proclamations, MLRs, MLOs etc. including Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 and the actions taken thereon, till the lifting of the Martial Law on April 7, 1979.  The election of the Second Parliament was con- ducted in February, 1979, during Martial Law. At that time, Lieutenant General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc., was the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator. <br> The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, was passed on April 6, 1979, legalizing all the Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations, Martial Law Orders and the actions taken thereon, some of which are mentioned above. <br> Any common man of ordinary prudence would say that the enormity of illegality sought to be legal- ized by this Act, would have shocked the Chief Justice Coke so much so that it would have left him dumb instead of saying that ‘when an Act of Parliament is against right and reason, or repugnant .......................... the common law will control it and adjudge that Act to be void’. <br> Perhaps, it would also leave the Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, out of his comprehension, if he would found that ‘after a formal written Constitution has been lawfully adopted by a compe- tent body and has been generally accepted by the people including the judiciary as the Constitution of the country’, an army commander can have the audacity to change the Constitution beyond recogni- tion and transfiguring a secular Bangladesh into a theocratic State. <br> Perhaps the US Supreme Court would have kept mum instead of holding that the guarantee of due process bars Congress from enactments that ‘shock the sense of fair play’.  But what duty is cast upon us, It is ordained that we must not keep our eyes shut, rather, we are bound by our oath that we must see and appreciate the facts and the law in its proper perceptive.   ",
      "639. Coming back to Bangladesh, Mustafa  Kamal, CJ was emphatic in respect of the independ-  ence of Judiciary in Secretary, Ministry of Finance  vs Masdar Hossain 2000 BLT (AD) 234 where his  Lordship held at para 44, page-257-8 : <br> “44 . ..................The independence of the  judiciary, as affirmed and declared by Articles  94(4) and 116A, is one of the basic pillars of the  Constitution and cannot be demolished, whit-: tled down, curtailed or diminished in any man- ner whatsoever, except under the existing pro- visions of the Constitution. It is true that this independence, as emphasised by the learned  Attorney-General, is subject to the provisions  of the Constitution, but we find no provision in the Constitution which curtails, diminishes or  otherwise abridges this independence. ..... <br> His Lordship further held at para-60, pages-  263-4: “60....... When Parliament and the  executive instead of implementing the provi- sions of Chapter II of Part VI follow a different course not sanctioned by the Constitution, the higher Judiciary is within its jurisdiction to bring back the Parliament and the executive from constitutional derailment and give neces- sary directions to follow the constitutional course. This exercise was made by this Court in the case of Kudrat-e-Elahi panir vs Bangla- desh, 44 DLR(AD) 319 . We don't see why the High Court Division or this Court cannot repeat that exercise when a constitutional deviation is  detected and when there is a constitutional man- date to implement certain provisions of the Constitution.\" (The underlinings are mine) <br> Latifur Rahman J (as his Lordship hen was) also held so at para 76 page 271 <br> \"76 . The written Constitution of Bangladesh has placed the Supreme Court in the place of the guardian of the Constitution itself. It will not countenance to any inroad upon the Constitution. A referencee to Articles 94, 95, 96, and 147 of the Constitution clearly reveal the independent character of the  Supreme Court.\" (The underlinings are mine)   ",
      "638. His Lordship then considers the powers of the Court in respect of the Constitutional measure at page-71 : <br> “I for my part cannot conceive of a situa tion, in which, afler a formal written Constitution has been lawfully adopted i A competent body and has been generally accept- ed by the people including the judiciary as the Constitution of the country, the judiciary can claim to declare any of its provisions ultra vires or void. This will be no part of its function of interpretation. Therefore, in my view, however solemn or sacrosanct a document. if it is not incorporated in the Constitution or does not form a part thereof it cannot control the Constitution. At any rate, the Courts created under the Constitution will not have the power to_declare_any_ provision of the constitution itself. as being in violation of such a document, If in fact that document contains the expression of the will of the vast majority of the people, then the remedy for correcting such a violation will lie with the people and not with the judici- ary ........ if it appears only as a preamble to the Constitution, then it will serve the same purpose as any other preamble serves, namely, that in the case of any doubt as to the intent of the law-maker, it may be looked at to ascertain the true intent, but it cannot control the substantive provisions thereof. This does not, however, mean that the validity of no Constitutional measure can be tested in the Courts. ‘if a constitutional measure is adopted in a manner different to that prescribed in the constitution itself or is passed by a lesser num- ber_of votes than those_specified in the Constitution then the validity of such a measure may well be questioned and adjudicated wpov. This, however, will be possible only in the case of a Constitutional amendment but generally                 not in the case of a first or a new Constitution, unless the powers of the Constitution-making date to  body itself are limited by some supra-Constitu-  tional document.” (The underlinings are mine)  We do not have any doubts about the correct-  ness of the Constitutional position so lucidly  explained above although stated in the back-ground  of the Interim Constitution of Pakistan, 1972, but it  is true, in general, of any written Constitution.  ",
      "637. His Lordship further explains the nature of the power of the Court at page-70 : <br> “In exercising this power, the judiciary claims no supremacy over other organs of the Government but acts only as the administrator of the public will. Even when it declares a leg- islative measure unconstitutional and void, it does not do so, because, the judicial power is superior in degree or dignity to the legislative power, but because the Constitution has vested it with the power to declare what the law is in the cases which come before it. It thus merely enforces the Constitution as a paramount law whenever a legislative enactment comes into conflict with it because, it is its duty to see that the Constitution prevails. It is only when the Legislature fails to keep within its own Constitutional limits, the judiciary steps in to enforce compliance with the Constitution, This is no doubt a delicate task as pointed out in the case of Fazlul Quader Chowdhury vs Shah Nawaz, which has to be performed with great circumspection but it has nevertheless to be per- formed as a sacred Constitutional duty when other State functionaries disregard the limita- tions imposed upon them or claim to exercise power which the people have been careful to whithold from them.\"  ",
      "636. Hamoodur Rahman, C) explains the legal position thus in Sate vs Zie-ur Rahman PLD 1973 SC 29 ar page 69: <br> “This is a right which it acquires not de hors the Constitution but by virtue of the fact that it is a superior Court set up by the Consti- tution itself. It is not necessary for this purpose to invoke any divine or super-natural right but this judicial power is inherent in the Court itself. It flows from the fact that it is a constitutional court and it can only be taken away by abolishing the court itself.\"  ",
      "635. It is true that like the Supreme Courts in the United States or in India, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has got the power of review of both leg- islative and executive actions but such power of review would not place the Supreme Court with any higher position to those of the other two Branches of the Republic. The Supreme Court is the creation of the Constitution just like the Legislature and the Executive. But the Constitution endowed the Supreme Court with such power of judicial review and since the Judges of the Supreme Court have taken oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, they are obliged and duty bound to                declare and strike down any provision of law which is Inconsistent with the Constitution without any fear or favour to any body, This includes the power to declare any provision seeking to oust the jurisdic ton of the Court, as ultra vires to the Constitution.  ",
      "634. This is how the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary functions under the Constitutional scheme in Bangladesh. The Constitution is the undoubted source of all powers and functions of all three grand Departments of the Republic, just like the United States and India.  ",
      "633. In this part of the world we generally fol- low the common law principles but Bangladesh has got a written Constitution. This Constitution may be termed as controlled or rigid but incontradistinction to a Federal form of Government, as in the United States, it has a Parliamentary form of Government within limits set by the Constitution. Like the United States, its three grand Departments, ‘the Legislature makes, the Executive executes and judiciary con- strues the law’ (Chief Justice Marshall), constituting a trichotomy of power in the Republic under the Constitution. But the Bangladesh Parliament lacks the omnipotence of the British Parliament while the President is not the executive head like the US President but the Prime Minister is, like British Prime Minister, However, all the functionaries of the Republic owe their existence, powers and functions to the Constitution. ‘We the people of Bangladesh’, gave themselves this Constitution which is con- ceived of as a fundamental or an organic or a Supreme Law rising lofty high above all other laws in the country and Article 7(2) expressly spelt out that any law which is inconsistent with this Constitution, to that extent of the inconsistency, is void. As such, the provisions of the Constitution is the basis on which the vires of all other existing laws and those passed by the Legislature as well as the actions of the Executive, are to be judged by the Supreme Court, under its power of judicial review. This power of judicial review of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is, similar to those in the United States and in India.  ",
      "632. Since Marbury vs Madison (1803), the US Supreme Court went a long way in expounding the Constitution, a vigorous taproot, in the language of Woodraw Wilson, into a vast constitutional sys- tem. The process how the American Constitutional system has been developed can be understood from the oft quoted observation of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, as observed by Lord Denning : <br> “The rule in the United States is not con- tained in their Constitution itself. It is a judge- made rule. It was stated by Chief Justice Marshall in 1803 in the Marbury case. Later on Charles Evans Hughes, the tenth Chief Justice, in 1908 firmly declared : <br> ‘We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is and the judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty and our property under the Constitution.’ <br> Their Constitution nowhere provides that it shall be what the judges say it is. Yet it has become the most fundamental and far reaching principle of American constitutional Jaw.” (Quoted from Lord Denning : ‘What Next In The Law’ at page-318 of First Indian Reprint, 1993).  ",
      "241. He further says, “what is necessary is to have Judges who are prepared to fashion new tools, forge new methods, innovate new strategies and evolve a new jurisprudence, who are judicial states- men with a social vision and a creative faculty and who have, above all, a deep sense of commitment to the Constitution with a activist approach and obliga- tion for accountability, not to any party in power nor to the opposition ..........0...00.0e. We need Judges who are alive to the socio-economic realities of Indian life, who are anxious to wipe every tear from every eye, who have faith in the constitutional val- ues and who are ready to use law as an instrument for achieving the constitutional objectives (at page 179). He quoted the eloquent words of Justice Krishna lyer ; <br> “Independence of the judiciary is not genv- flexion; nor is it Opposition to every proposition of Government, It is neither judiciary made to Opposition measure nor Government’s pleas- ure”,        <br>         There is no hesitation in saying that these are the words of wisdom handed down to us by the generations of Judges who very politely and meekly from the beginning of the civilisation Reminded the monarch that the King is not above the law but under the law. Some of them were beheaded, imprisoned or destroyed but the cherished theme ran like a refrain throughout the pages of the history.”  ",
      "631. About the judiciary and its independence, BH Chowdhury, J, further observed, quoting Bhagwati, J and Justice Krishna Iyer, at para- 240- 241, page-105 :  <br> “240 . This point may now be considered. Independence of judiciary is not an abstract conception. Bhagwati, J, said “if there is one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it is the judici- ary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the Jaw and thereby making the rule of law a mean- ingful and effective’. He said that the Judges must uphold the core principle of the rule of law which says, “Be you ever so high, the law is above you”. This is the principle of independ- ence of the judiciary which is vital for the estab- lishment of real participatory democracy, main- tenance of the rule of law as a dynamic concept and delivery of social justice to the vulnerable sections of the Community. It is this principle of independence of the judiciary which must be kept in mind while interpreting the relevant pro- visions of the Constitution (SP Gupta vs President of India and others AIR 1982 SC at page 152).  ",
      "630. When King said that he thought the law was founded on reasons and that he and others had reasons as well as Judges, Coke answered : <br> True it was that God has endowed his Majesty with excellent science and great endowments of nature, but his Majesty was not learned in the law of his realm in England, and causes which concemed the life or inheritance or good or fortune of his subject, are not to be decided by natural reasons, but by the artificial reasons and judgment of the law, which law is an act which requires long study and experi- ence, before that 2 man can attain the cog- nizance of it, and the law was the golden metawand one and measure to try the causes of the subject and which protect his Majesty in safety and peace”. <br> The moral is here in the following words: . <br> “The greatest of all the means .......... for ensuring the stability of Constitution-but which is now a days generally neglected is the educa- tion of citizens in the spirit of the Constitution  ................. To live by the rule of the Constitution ought not to be regarded as slavery, but rather as salvation.” (Aniistotle’s Politics (335-322 BC) pp 233-34”  ",
      "629. It may be recalled that a thousand years ago, the King of England, as a fountain of justice, was the first Magistrate of his Realm but by and by his judicial functions were taken over by his judges. In this connection a historical episode was narrated by BH Chowdhury, J, (as his Lordship then was) in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury’ case at para-253, page-108 (BLD) :               <br>  “253 . This judgment will be incomplete if a historical episode is not mentioned, Sir Coke was summoned by King James first to answer why the King could not himself decide cases which has to go before his own Court of justice. Sir Coke asserted: <br> “No King after the conquest assumed him- self to give any judgment in any cause whatso- ever which concerned the administration of jus- tice within the realm but these are solely deter- mined in the court of justice.”  ",
      "628. It is the people of Bangladesh, who pro- claimed that ‘We, the people of Bangladesh’, deemed that there shall be a Supreme Court for Bangladesh, that is why this Supreme Court came into being out of Article 94 of the Constitution, with all the attributes of such a High Tribunal as in exis- tence in the civilised world.  ",
      "627. Now back to Bangladesh. Under the Constitution of Bangladesh, all the powers and func- tions of the Republic are vested in the three grand Branches, namely, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. All these Branches, however, owe their existence to the Constitution since it is the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh.  ",
      "626. Hamoodur Rahman, CJ in dealing with Martial Law provision in Asma Jilani’s case held at page -202 : <br> “However, as this question has been raised, regarding the validity of Martial Law Regu- lation No. 78, I must point out that it follows from what I have said earlier that it was made by an authority whose legal competence we have not been able to recognise on the ground of want of legal authority and the unconstitu- tional manner of arrogation of pwer.\" <br> His Lordship further held at page-204 : <br> “Reverting now to the question of the legality of the Presidential Order No, 3 of 1969 and the Martial Law Regulation No. 78 of 1971 it follows from the reasons given earlier that they were both made by an incompetent authot- ity and therefore lacked the attribute of legiti- macy which is one of the essential characteris- tics of a valid law. The Presidential Onder No.3 of 1969 was also invalid on two additional grounds, namely, that it was a Presidential Order, which could not in terms of the Provi- sional Constitution Order itself amend the Constitution so as to take away the jurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts under Article 98 and that it certainly could not, in any event, take away the judicial power of the Courts to hear and determine questions pertainingeven to their own jurisdiction and this power could not be vested in another authority as long as the Courts continued to exist.\" <br> Yaqub Ali, J, also held in the same vein at p -237 : <br> “As both President's Order No. 3 of 1969 and Martial Law Regulation 78 were intended to deny to the Courts the performance of their judicial functions an object opposed to the con- cept of law, Neither would be recognized by Courts as law,” <br> The moral is clear. If any provision sought to oust the Jurisdiction of Court, that provision itself is not law.  ",
      "625. It may be noted that it is not for the aggrieved persons to plead law but for the Judges to apply the correct provisions of the Constitution and the laws made thereunder and if necessary under the circumstances, is entitled either to uphold any par- ticular statute or to declare it invalid being contra- dictory to the Constitution so long the Government gets adequate opportunity to support the offending provision if so advised. This is the position in the United States, so also in India and there is no reason why it should be otherwise in Bangladesh.  ",
      "624. Justice Robert H Jackson held the same view as will be apparent from his Godkin Lecture, quoted above: <br> “ .............. thus it comes about that in a pri- vate litigation the Court may decide a question of power that will be_of great moment to the nation or toa State,”  This was also indicated by AR Cornelius, CJ in Fazlul Quader Chowdhury vs Muhammad Abdul Haque PLD 1963 SC 486, at page-503:            <br>    “The duty of interpreting the Constitution is, in a fact a duty of enforcing the provisions of the Constitution in_any particular case brought before the Courts in the form of litifation..\" As such it is apparent that the Court may con- sider the constitutionality of any provision in course of a litigation brought before it, it does not have to be a public interest litigation to do so,  ",
      "623. The Supreme Court of India even treated mere letters of an aggrieved person as a petition — under Article 32 and dispensed justice in accordance with law. The Supreme Court of Pakistan, in one occasion, on receipt of a telegram from the Amnesty International, stayed public hangings on finding those as violative of human dignity.  ",
      "622. In that detention case, the High Court held that they had no jurisdiction to enquire into the matter because of an ouster clause in The Jurisdiction of Courts (Removal of Doubts) Order, 1969 (President’s Order No. 3 of 1969). In that premises, this is how Hamoodur Rahman, C J, dealt with the controversy in Asma Jilani s Case in setting her father, Malik Ghulam Jilani, free, at page-197- 199 ; <br> “This provision, as very appropriately pointed out by Mr Brohi, strikes at the very root of the judicial power of the Court to hear and determine a matter, even though it may relate to its own jurisdiction. The Courts undoubtedly                have the power to hear and determine any mat- ter or controversy which is brought before them, even if it be to decide whether they have the jurisdiction to determine such a matter or not. The superior Courts are, as is now W ell set- tled, the Judges of their own jurisdiction. This is a right which has consistently been claimed by this and other Courts of superior jurisdiction in all civilised countries .. .(Page-197)  Learned Attorney-General does not seri- ously dispute the correctness of the contention that “judicial power” is different from “jurisdic tion” * and so faras judicial power is concemed it must exist in courts as long as the courts are there. In fact, he has been bold enough, and I admire him for his boldness, in characterising these provisions of the Presidential Order No. 3 of 1969, which seek to take away the judicial power itself as “absurdities”. He frankly con- power itself as absurdities. He frankly con- cedes that the Courts have and must have the power to determine all questions of their own jurisdiction. It is a proposition so well-settled that no one can challenge it. <br> The learned Attorney-General has, howev- er, sought to contend that where there is a writ- ten Constitution the Courts are themselves crea- tures of the Constitution and have only such jurisdictions as the Constitution chooses to con- fer upon them. I have no cavil with this propo- sition, as I have myself is several cases indicat- ed that the constitution can confer or restrict the jurisdiction of even superior courts but this is not the same thing as saying that it can also restrict or curtail the judicial pwer because that in effect would be denying to the court the very function for which it exists. i.e. to decide a controversy even if it relates to its own jurisdic- tion. <br> In the view that I have taken of the President Order No. 3 1969 that it is a sub- constitutional legislation I cannot but hold that it could not have curtailed the jurisdiction that was given to the High Courts and to this Court by the Constitution of 1962, for, that jurisdic- tion was preserved even by the Provisional Constitution Order. <br> Looking at the matter, therefore, from any point of view, whether, from the strictly legal and constitutional side, or on the basis of the Principle of implied authority as suggested by Mr Manzoor Qadir, or even in terms of the so-called legal order purported to be created by the Provisional Constitution Order of 1969 itself, I cannot escape the conclusion that the Presidential Order No, 3 was an unconstitutional document. General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan according to me no authority to pass such legislation taking away the powers of the courts in his capacity as president under the provisional constitution order. The Martial Law introduced by him was illegal and therefore, even as Chief Martial Law Administrator he was not competent to_validly pass _such laws, and it certainly was in excess of the implied authority, if any, given to him by the letter of Field Marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan dated the 24th of March 1969.  The High Courts were, therefore, wrong in thinking that they had no jurisdiction to enquire into this matter.”  ",
      "621. O Hood Phillips’ in his ‘Constitutional and Administrative Law’, Seventh Edition (1987), explains the mechanism at page-8: <br> \" ......... federal courts have juris- diction to declare provisions of state constitu- lions, state legislation and federal legislation repugnant to the Federal Constitution. It is not Strictly accurate to say that the Courts declare legislation void: when cases are brought before them judicially, they may declare that_an alleged right or power does not exist or that an alleged wrong has been committed because a certain statue relied on is unconstitutional.”  (The underlinings are mine)  Similarly, the case of Asma Jilani etc vs Government of Punjab PLD 1972 SC 139, arose out of habeas corpus petitions for detention of the detenue under Martial Law Regulation 78 of 1971. The Supreme Court of Pakistan not only declared the orders of detention illegal but went further and also held both Presidential Order No. 3 of 1969 and the Martial Law Regulation No. 78 of 1971, as invalid.  ",
      "620. It will be interesting to note that Marbury was not at all interested in the supremacy of the Constitution or the Supreme Court’s power of judi- cial review. He only made a request for mandamus upon Madison, the Secretary of State, directing him to deliver his commission which was ready in all respect but could not be delivered to him earlier due to paucity of time, But the Supreme Court in course of considering his grievance, very consciously declared invalid an Act of the Congress. This is how the US Supreme Court wields its power of Judicial review of legislative actions.  ",
      "618. Normally, the matter would have been ended there but Chief Justice Marshall did not stop there, It was not necessary but he digged further, although, Marbury was only interested in his own commission and not in the least in the vires of the relevant clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789, but Marshall CJ, on examination of the relevant provi- sions found that a contradiction did in fact exist between the Constitution and the pertinent provision of the aforesaid Act.  Robert K Carr tried to visualize the mind-set of a great Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in its infancy in this manner : <br> “In other words, Marshall was invoking that power for the first time at just such a moment when the Fathers probably intended it should be exercised. Jefferson had become  president and his party had won control of Congress. The opposition had obtained com- plete control of the political branches of the government. Is_it_not obvious that_from_the point of view of the Founding Fathers and the Federalist party the time had come to point out that the Constitution as a higher law did place restraints upon congress at the Supreme court as guardian of the constitution had power to enforce those restraints?  In Marbury vs Madison we see Chief Justice Marshall suggesting that the Supreme Court was duty-bound as _a__matter of unescapable__principle to enforce __the constitution as as ol of restraint upon con-                gressional authority through the exercise of its power of Judicial review, ......., * (Quoted from Robert K. Carr on ‘The Supreme Court’ and Judicial Review\" at page-71), (The underlinings are mine)  This is how the review was made two hundred years ago in Marbury vs Madison:  \"If an act of the legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void does it notwithstand- ing its invalidity bind the courts and oblige them to give it effect? or in other words though it be not law does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law?   It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.   The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution.  Could it be the intention of those who gave this power, to say that in using it the constitu- tion should not be looked into? That a case aris- ing under the constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it rises?  This is too extravagant to be maintained. .... Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void: and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by_that_ instrument.” (Quoted from Professor  Noet T. Dowling on the ‘Cases on Constitutional Law Fifth Edition, 1954, at pages-95-97),  ",
      "617. The Court found: that the Constitution limited the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court only In two types of cases, namely, the cases affecting the ambassadors and those in which a State shall be a party but in all other cases the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, not original, As such, the request of Marbury for mandamus was denied,  ",
      "616. John Marshall was a Federalist, He actively participated in the American War of Independence. He was appointed as the Chief Justice of the US Federal Supreme Court by President Adams In early 1801,  ",
      "615. Marbury was one of the ‘midnight judges’, appointed at the last-minute of the tenure of President Adams. The President, however, had acted within constitutional statute and all the appoint- ments were confirmed by the Senate, But unfortu- nately for Marbury, Thomas Jefferson, the new President, took office on March 4, 1801, before his commission could be delivered to him. It was there- after never delivered presumably on the direction of the new President.  ",
      "614. In Marbury vs Madison (1803), William Marbury under a provision of the Judiciary, Act of 1789, prayed to the Supreme Court for issuing a writ of mandamus, compelling James Madison, the Secretary of State, to deliver him his commission for | his appointment as justice of the peace.  ",
      "613. In the United States, the Supreme Court in the last years of the 18th century, started to exer- cise its power of judicial review in deciding the con- stitutionality of Federal and State laws. In Hylton VU S(1796) and in Calder vs Bull (1798), the Court, however, after consideration, upheld the legislation.  ",
      "612. At that time, however, the Bill of Rights, 1689, declaring the supremacy of the Parliament was not enacted. But Chief Justice Holt in the City of London vs Wood (1701) also subscribed to the views of Chief Justice Coke in 1701 also.  ",
      "611. In ultimate analysis it would appear that it is the people which is the source of power of the Court because ‘We the people of the United States’ dreamt that they would have a Court which would be independent of both Congress and the Executive and cannot be brow-beaten by any. The people believe that inspite of all its short-comings, the Supreme Court is still the most trustworthy and at the same time dispassionate custodian of their nghts and liberties guaranteed under their own Constitution. That is why the famous Presidents like Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, inspite of their visible irritation towards many Rulings of the Supreme Court, dared not curb any of its constitu- tional prerogatives. There lies the real supremacy of the Supreme Court and although ‘scarcely any polit- ical question arises in the United States that is not resolved sooner or later into a judicial question’ (Alexis de Tocqueville, 1848). The Supreme Court neither approves nor condemns any legislative poli- cy, it declares whether the legislation is in accor- dance with or in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution, It is ‘the living voice of the Constitution’ (Bryce).  Now on the question of judicial review.  Chief Justice Coke in Dr Bonham’ Case (1610) went so far as to declare that the Court can even declare an Act of Parliament void.  Chief Justice Coke said : <br> “When an Act of Parliament is against right and reason, OF repugnant, OF impossible to be                performed, the common law will control it and adjudge that Act to be void.\" (Quoted from Lond Denning in ‘What Next In The Law\" page: 319),  His such views was supported by Hobart CJ, another contemporary Chief Justice, He held in Day vs Savage (1614), “... even an Act of Parliament made against natural equity, as to make a man judge in his own cause, is void in itself, for jura natural sunt immutabilia and they are leges legumes.\"(Quoted from Administrative Law by HWR Wade, Fifth Edition, 1982 at page-418).  ",
      "610. Alexander Hamilton in his Federalist 78 (1787-1788) examined the judiciary department of the proposed government thus :  “The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution, I under- stand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attain- der, no ex post facto laws, and the like.  Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of the courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void, Without this, all the reser- vations of particular rights or privileges would amount to NOTHING. ....... No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the constitution can be valid to deny this would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal: that the servant is above his mas!e6 that the representatives of the people are sups rior to the people themselves; that men, acting                by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.  It is far more Rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It must therefore belong to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; in other words, the constitution ought to _be pre- ferred to the statue the intention of the people to the intention their agents. ......... ” ( Quoted from Pater Woll on ‘American Government’, 1962) (The underlinings are mine).(page-265- 266).  It is apparent that the framers of the Constitu- tion envisioned that the Supreme Court shall exer- cise its power of judicial review.  The authority of the Supreme Court, in the lan- guage of Justice Robert H Jackson was, in his pro- posed Godkin lecture at Harvard in 1954, which he could never deliver on the topic ‘The Supreme Court as a Unit of Government’: <br> “What authority does the Court possess which generates this influence? The answer is its power to hold unconstitutional and judicial- ly unenforceable an act of the President of Congress or of a constituent state of the Federation. That power is not expressly granted or hinted at in the Article defining judicial power, but _res on logical implication. It is an incident of jurisdiction to determine what really is the law governing a particular case or contro- versy. In the hierarchy of legal values, if the higher law of the Constitution prohibits what the lower law of the legislative attempts, the latter is a nullity' otherwise, the Constitution would exist only at the option of Congress Thus it comes about that in a private litigation the Court may decide a question of power that will be of great moment to the nation or to a state,” (Quoted from the draft lecture notes of Justice Robert H. Jackson of US Supreme Court, published by Harvard University Press, 1955, at page-22) (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "609. The Supreme Court of the United States wields its powers from this Article of the Consti- tution. In pursuance of the powers ordained in this provision, the Supreme Court is charged with the delicate task of declaring the constitutionality not only of the administrative actions of the Executive but also of the laws enacted by the Legislatures. That was the intention of the founding fathers of the said great Republic. Such intentions can be gathered from the Federalist Papers also.   ",
      "608. The United States of America is the first Republic which appears to have accepted the doc- trine of separation of powers in the first three Articles of its Constitution.  Article III begins with the statement ‘The judi- cial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish’. Section 2 states that the judicial power shall extend to all cases, in Jaw and equity, arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United State.  ",
      "607. These three distinct branches of the Republic commensurate with the Doctrine of the Separation of Powers propounded by Baron Montesquieu. In his De | ‘Esprit des Lois (1748), he stressed the importance of the independence of <br> Judiciary : <br> “When the legislative and executive pow- ers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be_no_liber- ty...Again, there is no liberty if the power of judging is not separated from the legislative and executive. If it were joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would then be the legislator. If it were joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression. There would be an end to everything. if the same man or the same body, whether of the nobles or the people, were to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing public affairs, and that of trying crimes or individual causes,” (The underlings are mine)  (Quoted from Hilaire Barnett on Constitutional and Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, 2002). (page-106)  ",
      "605. We have already found that those Proclamations etc. were issued in complete viola- tion of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, notably, Articles 7, 21, 31 and 142 :  Article 7 : <br> (1) All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution, <br> (2) This Constitution is, as the solem\" expression of the will of the people                the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void. <br> Article 21: <br> (1) Itis the duty of every citizen to observe the Constitution and the laws, to main- tain discipline, to perform public duties and to protect public property. <br> (2) Every person in the service of the Republic has a duty to strive at all times to serve the people. <br> Article 31: <br> To enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being within Bangladesh, and in particular no action detri- mental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law.  But by the Proclamations etc, the Martial Law Authorities, specially Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc, changed the basic feature and structure of the Constitution so much so that secular Bangladesh had been deformed into a theocratic State.  We have already found that the Constitution which is the supreme Jaw of Bangladesh, was made subordinate and subservient to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs, by the Martial Law Authorities, which had no legal basis thereby betrayed and insulted the entire population of Bangladesh with its three million martyrs.  We have also found that Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc, had no authority or jurisdiction either to declare Martial Law in Bangladesh or to govern Bangladesh by such Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. We have further found that rule by Martial Law is a negation of liberty and independence for which nearly three million Bangalees laid down their lives.  Paragraph 18 to the Fourth Schedule, was thrust into the Constitution by the Fifth Amendment, sought to legalise all those arbitrary and illegal Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. As such, the Court is not only entitled but it is imperative on its part to break open the veil of enactment and to bring those Proclamations etc. to open which the said amendments illegally sought to ratify, confirm and validate and which would certainly ‘shock the sense of fair play’ of any reasonable person.  We have also noticed the last limb of Para -18 to the Fourth Schedule : <br> “18 . All Proclamations -made during the period between the 15th August, 1975, and the 9th April, 1979............ ..................all orders made, acts and things done,.......be called in question in or before any Court tribunal or authority on any ground whatsoever.  This kind of ouster of jurisdiction clause is negation of fair play, and devoid of confidence on the part of the dictators and almost always is employed to shun away from the scrutiny of a Court of law. This is what we term as the breach of the principle of rule of law.  Thus, in enacting the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, a colourable legislation, a fraud was committed upon the people of Bangladesh,  This is the worst case of violation of rule of law known to us, comparable possibly only to the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1986 . As such, we are of the opinion, that the Parliament had no rational basis in enacting the Fifth Amendment, in violation of the various provisions of the Constitution, notably, the Third Paragraph of the Preamble and Articles 7, 21 and 31, and also 142,               <br> Part XXX Role of the Supreme Court and Its Power of Judicial Review <br> We have noticed above that Paragraph 18 to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution sought to oust the jurisdiction of the Court.  Article 55(2) of the Constitution of Bangladesh vests the executive power of the Republic on the Prime Minister while under Article 65(1), the leg- islative powers are vested on the Parliament which is the House of the Nation. Similarly, Article 94(1) provides for the establishment of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Article 114 provides for the subordi- nate courts.  ",
      "604. This contention, however, is literally true that the Fifth Amendment itself did not create any new law but section 2 added new paragraph, name- ly, Paragraph 18, to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution. This provision ratified, confirmed and validated all Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the actions taken thereon thereby sought to hide a black period of our Constitutional history because those Proclamations etc. literally uprooted the Constitution, not merely changed it.  ",
      "603. It may be reiterated that it was contended on behalf of the respondents that the Fifth Amendment itself, did neither make any new provi- sion nor changed any basic feature of the Constitution, that it merely ratified, confirmed and validated Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs, MLOs etc, and only the actions taken thereon.  ",
      "602. In Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case MH Rahman, J considered rule of law on the touchstone of the preamble at para -443 : <br> \"443 . In this case we are concerned with only one basic feature, the rule of law, marked out as one of the fundamental aims of our soci. cty in the Preamble : The validity of the impugned amendment may be examined, with or without resorting to the doctrine of basic fea- ture, on the touchstone of the Preamble itself.”  In view of our discussions made above, let us now examine how far Constitution (Fifth Amend- ment) Act, 1979, adhrered to the principles of rule of law, as solemnly and lofty enshrined in the Third Paragraph of the Preamble of the Constitution of Bangladesh.  ",
      "601. Hilaire Barnett in the Constitutional and Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, (2002) drew her conclusion thus : at page-103 :  “The law is not autonomous but rest on the support of those it governs. The law is the ser- vant of the sense of rightness in the community, and whilst the rule of law places law above every individual irrespective of rank and sta- tion- it remains, paradoxically, subject _to_the ultimate judgment of the people.”  ",
      "600. In Bachan Singh vs Punjab AIR 1982 SC 1325, Bhagwati, J expounded the heart of rule of Jaw in this manner at pages 1336-1337 : <br> \"10..... it is clear that the rule of law permeates the entire fabric of the Constitution                and indeed forms one of its basic features. The rule of law excludes arbitrariness; its postulate is ‘intelligence without passion’ and ‘reason freed from desire’. Wherever we find arbitrari- Ness or unreasonableness there is denial of the rule of law. That is why Aristotle preferred a government of laws rather than of men. ‘Law’, in the content of the rule of law, does not mean any law enacted by the legislative authority, howsoever, arbitrary or despotic it may be. Otherwise, even under a dictatorship it would be possible to say that there is rule of law, because every law made by the dictator, howso- ever, arbitrary and unreasonable has to be obeyed and every action has to be taken in con- formity with such law. In. such a case too even where the political set up is dictorical. it is law that governs the relationship between men and men and between me e State. But still it is not rule of law as understood in modern jurisprudence, because in jurisprudential terms the law itself in such a case being an emanation from the absolute will of t dictator it is in effect and substance the rule of man and not of law which prevails in such a situation. What is a necessary element of the rule of law is that the law must not be arbitrary or irrational and it must satisfy the test of reason and the demo- cratic form of policy seeks to ensure this ele- ment by making the framers of the law account-  able to the people. ............ ”  ",
      "599. Mathew, J in Smit Indira Nehru Gandhi’ case explained the concept of rule of law in this manner : <br> “338 . The rule of law postulates the per- suasiveness of the spirit of law throughout the whole _range_of Government_in_ the sense_of excluding arbitrary official action _in_any sphere. ‘Rule of Law’ is an expression to give reality to something which is not readily expressible, That is why Sir Ivor Jennings said that it is an unruly horse. Rule of Law is based upon the liberty o individual and has as its object, the harmonizing of the opposing notions of individual liberty and public order, The notion of justice maintains the balance between the two; and justice has a variable content.”  ",
      "598. Next we shall consider the case of Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi vs Raj Narain AIR 1975 SC 2299 . In that case, the appellant was declared elect- ed to Lok Sabha in March, 1971 . This was chal- lenged by the respondent in an election petition in the High Court. The High Court declared the elec- tion void. During the pendency of her appeal before the Supreme Court, Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975, was made, making various changes including insertion of Article 329A. It was argued, inter alia, before the Supreme Court that the election of the appellant would not be void since in view of clause 4 of Article 329A, no law relating to the election petitions made before the aforesaid amendment, would be applicable to the election of the appellant to the Lok Sabha, Khanna, J, held :  \"205 .................... Rule of law postulates that the decisions should be made by the application of known principles and rules and in general such decisions should be predictable and the citizen should know where he is. If a decision is taken without any principle or without any rule, it is not predictable and such decision is the antithesis of a decision taken in accordance with the rule of law. <br> 206 . The matter can also be looked at from another angle. The effect of impugned clause (4) is to take away both the right and the reme- dy to challenge the election of the appellant. Such extinguishment of the right and remedy to challenge the validity of the election, in my opinion, is on with the process of free and fair elections.\"  ",
      "597. In this connection the US Supreme Court held that the guarantee of due process bars Congress from enactments that ‘shock the sense of fair play.’ (Bowen vs Gilliard 483 US 587 = 97L Ed 2d 485(1987), (Quoted from American Jurisprudence, Second Edition, Vol 16B. Para -893, Page-469).  ",
      "596. The American version of the rule of law was contained in the Fifth Amendment of Federal Constitution. This amendment was proposed by Madison and was ratified in 1791 along with nine other amendments which together are known as the ‘Bill of Rights’. The said Fifth Amendment reads as follows :              <br>  “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in case arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a wit- ness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, Without just compensation.”  This is a charter for liberty, equality and frater- nity for the citizen of the United States. The people of the other countries may feel envious for this amendment alone. This embodies a constitutional limitation or check on the powers of the Govern- ment that no person should be deprived of life, lib- erty or property except by due process of law, This amendment guarantees the right to be free and to obtain judicial relief for any illegal violation of such rights. Jt is the deprivation of right or interest with- out due process of Jaw, is unconstitutional which was set right by this amendment.  ",
      "595. In Ashby vs White (1703), White, the Tory mayor and other returning officers refused to accept the vote of Ashby, a whig in the election for Aylesburg. The plaintiff’s action for damages failed in the King’s Bench. But the dissenting views of Holt. CJ, which was upheld by the House of Lords, was as follows :  “if the plaintiff has a right, he must of necessity have a means to vindicate and main- tain it, and a remedy if he is injured in the exer- cise or enjoyment of it, and indeed it is a vain thing to imagine a right without a remedy; for want of right and want of remedy are recipro- cal.”(Quoted from ‘Administrative Law By HWR Wade, Fifth Edition, 1982 at page-670).  But long before that when Hazrat Umar Farooq (RA), was elected as the Caliph in 633 AD, he not only appointed Qadis for every district but issued the following instructions :  “Praise to God.  Verily Justice is an important obligation to God and man. You have been charged with this responsibility. Discharge the responsibility so that you may win the approbation of God and the goodwill of the people.  Treat the people equally in your presence, in your company, and in your decisions, so that the weak despair not of justice, and the high- placed have no hope of your favour.  The onus of proof lies on the plaintiff. He who denies must do so on oath. Compromise is permissible, provided _it does not turn the unlawful into lawful, and the lawful into unlaw- ful. ...” (Quoted from Prof. Masud-ul- Hasan on ‘Hadrat Umar Farooq’, Second Edition, 2001, at page-167-8).  This shows that the spirit of Rule of Law was present so long ago in Arabian Peninsula on the advent of Islam.  ",
      "594. At about this time, Moghal Emperor Jahangir, after his ascension to the throne in 1605, hung a great golden chain with sixty bells in his palace so that any man of however humble calling, could pull it in order to draw his attention, so that the Emperor could readily redress his grievance and grant relief to his sufferings. The purpose was obvi- ously to see that even handed justice is dispensed with.  ",
      "593. James I, on coming to the English throne, initially tried to assert his divine right to be the King but on the remonstrance of the Commons, Lord Salisbury reported to the House of Lords that the King had acknowledged that, although he derived his title from his ancestors, “yet the law did set the crown upon his head,” “and that he was a king by the common law of the land.” (1610) (Quoted from English Constitutional History By Thomas Pitt Taswell-Langmead, Tenth Edition, 1946, Page-384 n.p.).  ",
      "592. Earlier, during the reign of Edward III, men were. arbitrarily imprisoned without legal                  process, as such, in those early years of the Parlia- ment in England in enacting a provision in 1354, debarring such arbitrary action, used the words ‘due process of law’: <br> “that no man, of what estate or condition that he be, should be put out of his lands or ten- ements, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disherit- ed, nor put to death, without being brought to answer by due process of law:” (Quoted from Select Documents of English Constitutional History, 1910, Edited by George Burton Adams and H. Morse Stephens, from clause IV of The Petition of Right, at page-340).  (The underlinings are mine)  This provision was enacted long before the enactment of the Fifth Amendment of the US Federal Constitution in 1791.  ",
      "591. This English principle of rule of law or the American concept of ‘due process of law’ was first found place in the Magna Carta. The Great Charter of the Barons was accepted by the King John of England in June 15, 1215 at Runnymede. Clause 39 and 40 are : <br> “39 . No free man shall be taken or impris- oned or disseised or outlawed or exiled or in any way ruined, nor will we go or send against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land. <br> 40 . To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay right or justice.” (Quoted from 1215 The year of Magna Carta by Danny Danziger & John Gillingham, 2003).  In the Thirteenth Century, Henry de Bracton was a Judge during the reign of King Henry HI, He had the courage to write in his Treatise : <br> “Quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, Sed Sub Deo et Lege” (That the King should not be under man, but under God and the law).  At that time and thereafter on the divine right to rule asserted by the Kings of England, Bracton was quoted time and again to the their annoyance who took it not only as an affront but as a treason spe- cially by the Stuart King James I.   ",
      "590. But the obligation to obey law was shown long ago in 399 BC by Socrates. We learn from the writings of Plato that Anytus and Meletus and other democratic leaders of Athens charged Socrates that he was an atheist because he believed in one God instead of many and that he was corrupting the minds of youths of Athens who were his pupils. The crowd of Athens decreed that he should drink the hemlock. His friends offered him an easy escape but he refused, rather, accepted the verdict in obedience to the law of Athens although he knew that he was not wrong, but preferred death than giving up his right to free thought.  ",
      "589. But Stanley de Smith viewed the ideas of cracy. His notion of rule of  \".......... One can at least say that the concept is usually intended to imply (i) that the powers exercised by politicians and officials must have a legitimate foundation; they must be based on authority conferred by law; and (i) that the law should conform to certain mint- mum standards of justice, both substantive and procedural.” (Quoted from the Constitutional And Administrative Law by Stanley de Smith and Rodney Brazier, Eighth Edition at page-  17)..  ",
      "588. AV Dicey in his ‘An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution’, 10th Edition (1959), explained the meaning of the Rule of Law which has profound influence on the thoughts in this branch of discipline in Constitutional Law. Dicey summed up at pages-202-3 : <br><br> “That “rule of law,” then, which forms 4 fundamental principle of the constitution, 2 three meanings, or may be regarded from three different points of view. <br>               It means, in the first place, the absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power, and excludes the existence of arbitrariness, of pre- rogative, or even of wide discretionary authori- ty on the part of the government. Englishmen are ruled by the law, and by the law alone; a man may with us be punished for a breach of law, but he can be punished for nothing else.  It means, again, equality before the law, or the equal subjection of all classes to the ordi- nary law of the land administered by the ordi- nary law courts; the “rule of law” in this sense excludes the idea of any exemption of officials or others from the duty of obedience to the law which governs other citizens or from the juris- diction of the ordinary tribunals; ...........-  The “rule of law,” lastly, may be used as a formula for expressing the fact that with us the law of the constitution, the rules which in for- eign countries naturally form part of a constitu- tional code, are not the source but the conse- quence of the rights of individuals, as defined and enforced by the courts; that, in short, the principles of private law have with us been by the action of the courts and Parliament so extended as to determine the position of the Crown and of its servants; thus the constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land.”  ",
      "587. In this connection, it should be noted that ‘Rule of Law’ means, supremacy of law. It means all are treated equally under the Jaw in accordance with the same yardstick of standard as opposed to arbi- trary exercise of power. It means, from the highest in the country to the lowliest, all must submit to law and Jaw alone. It means that there cannot be any divergence of approach in dispensing justice but must be on equal footing in all respect. Above all. it implies the notion of liberty. Besides, so far the Executive is concerned, it must also be a Goverm- ment under the law.  ",
      "585. No wonder, Hamoodur Rahman, CJ, in Asma Jilanis case was very emphatic in holding at page -207 : <br> \"I would not also condone anything which seriously impairs the rights of citizens except in  so far as they may be designed to advance the social welfare and national solidarity.”  Rightly, Yakub Ali, J, sounded a stern warning to the future usurpers at page -243 ;  “My own view is that a person who destroys the national Jegal order jn an illegiti- mate manner cannot be regarded as a valid source of law-making, May be, that on account of his holding the coercive apparatus of the State, the people and the Courts are silenced temporarily, but let it be Jaid down firmly that the order which the usurper imposes will remain illegal and Courts will not recognize its rule and act upon as de jure. As soon as the first opportunity arises, when the consicous apparatus falls from the hands of the usurper he should be tried for high reason and suddenly punished. I his alone will serve as a deterrert to would be adventurers,”  (The underlinings ore ming) <br> Part XKIK The Rule of Law <br> The next question is whether the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, violates the principle of rule of Jaw. We have already held that the Mania) Law Proclamations cle, were all illegal and were issued without Jawful authority. This question has become pertinent because by this amendment new right or obligation, either of the State or its cit- izens has been created, rather, this amendment rati- fied, confirmed and validated the preceding Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the actions taken thereon.  ",
      "584. By invoking the Kelsen’s theory, the above changes can be explained. But this theory of grund norm cannot be used as a legal justification for overthrowing a constitutional government by usurpers. A usurper shall remain a usurper for all time to come since their actions tantamount to dom- inate a free people, not the other way around as in the case of French Revolution. —  ",
      "583. Similarly grund norm was changed on 14th July, 1789 in France and on 14th August, 1947 in British India. Grund norm was also changed on the declaration of independence of Bangladesh on the night following March 25, 1971.  ",
      "582. But grund norm was changed on the dec- laration of Independence by the thirteen colonies of North America on 4th July 1776 which culminated in the formal surrender of Lord Cornwallis in October, 1781.  ",
      "581. We can see that grund norm was not changed during Interregrum although the country was under Commonwealth temporarily. King                Charles II actually ascended the thrown in 1660 but he was deemed to be the King since the death of Charles I in 1649, Legally, there was no existence of Commonwealth but only in history, So also the Martial Law periods.  ",
      "580. The Kelsen's theory of grund-norm can only be used to explain the past incidents and noth- ing more. A Judge in deciding a case may call upon many a legal theory in establishing his own point of view but should not regard it as a precedent.  ",
      "579. It may be noted that even the Privy Council did not approve the Kelson's theory in Madzimbamuto vs Lardner—Burke (1968) 3 All ER 561.  ",
      "578. This kind of illegal Goverment cannot be legitimized by invoking Kelsen’s theory as was done by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Dosso s case and was rightly overruled in Asma Jilant s case.  ",
      "577. This goes for Bangladesh also. Bangla- desh was not made independent, with the sacrifice of three million martyrs, to be ruled by the Martial Law Authorities. This is negation of independence. The Government which fails to govern by consent of the governed fails 10 satisfy the most basic and important criteria for legitimacy, that is to govern by consent. During the period of Martial Law, the peo- ple of Bangladesh was governed not according to their Constitution through their elected representa- tives in the House of Nations but by the Proclamations, MLRs, MLOs etc. and ruled by the Major Generals, Colonels etc. To the Bangalee peo- ple it mattered littke whether they were under the subjugation of the British or the Pakistanies or even the Bangalees. Since they were not governed by their own consent, through their own representa- tives, they were not free and independent and the Government which kept the people of Bangladesh under subjugation, in violation of the Constitution, was out and out an illegal one and shall remain so for all time to come.  ",
      "576. Munir CJ with respect, in his anxiety to bestow legitimization on the Martial Law Authorities in Dosso’s case, chained the people of Pakistan including the then East Pakistan by misin- terpreting Kelsen’s theory. His Lordship further missed the point, again with respect, that the Indian Independence Act, 1947, or the Government of India Act, 1935, did not envisage running of the Dominions with Martial Laws.  ",
      "575. As such to be independent in the real sense, the governance must be with the consent of the people to be governed. In case of existence of a written Constitution, such consent of the people must be strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, which is the embodiment of the will of the people, otherwise, it is no consent and the Government, however powerful it may be, is an ille- gal one. It has no right to gover the people which it sought to do by force, such as, by Martial Law Proclamations. The Governments which sought to rule without the consent of the governed can only be equated with the primitive rule by might, That kind of rule cannot be accepted as legal in the 20th or 21st century.  ",
      "574. From this analysis of historical events for the last four hundred years it would show that mere political independence of a country is not enough. The concept of independence or liberty will not be achieved if one person or a group of persons keep the people of a country under subjugation. The peo- ple has a right to refuse such subjugation although greater independence was offered by making the Kingdom in England as a Commonwealth by Oliver Cromwell. The same result followed in other coun- tries as discussed above.  ",
      "573. The liberation of Bangladesh is a classic example of this kind of independence. The Bangalees spearheaded the independence of Pakistan in 1947 but soon they discovered that they are being treated as a colony by the dominant West Pakistani Rulers. As such, the inevitable happened. The ordinary Bangalees fought against the militari- ly superior West Pakistani Army and jettisoned West Pakistan. Thus independent Bangladesh came into being.  ",
      "572. In France, French Revolution of 1789 swept the whole country. The France was not under subjugation of any other foreign country. It was the most flourishing country In Europe. It reached the height of prosperity in science, arts, culture, philos- ophy and in all other disciplines. The King was French and so also his subjects. But the despotism of Louis XVI left the people helpless. The writings of Voltaire, Montesquicu, Rousseau, Abbe Raynal, Quesnay, Turgot etc. roused the people to revolution with a battle cry for equality, liberty and fraternity. although as a nation, they were independent. Afier deposing the King, the National Assembly made the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens. Some of the rights as declared were as follows: <br> ‘I, Men are born, and always continue. free, and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility. <br> “II ............................ <br> ‘III. The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, or ANY BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it.  ‘IV. Political Liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure another. The exercise of the natural rights of every man, has no other limits than those which are necessary to secure to every other man the free exercise of the same rights; and these limits are deter- minable only by the law.   (Quoted from Thomas Paine : Rights of Man, Pub: Penguin classics 1985, page-110-1).  These historical incidents clearly show that the concept of independence is not only to free a con munity from an alien subjugation but if necessary,                also to free itself from the subjugation of its own people.  ",
      "571. The question of governance arose during the middle of the 18th Century in thirteen North American Colonies. Although most of the people in those colonies had the same culture, Janguage and religion but when they felt that they were being gov- ered through imposition of taxes against their con- sent, in no time they rose as the ‘Sons of Liberty’ and the ultimate result was the Declaration of Independence in the 4th of July, 1776, proclaiming: <br> “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalien- able rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the con- sent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying HS foundation on such principles, and oe rceeen its powers in such form, as to them shal! ne most likely to effect their safety and happiness.  ",
      "570. Lord Fairfax, the Commander in Chief of the Commonwealth with his Second in Command, Lieutenant-General Oliver Cromwell, could defeat the army of King Charles I on a number of occasions but could not won the hearts of the English people. The dream of Cromwell to become the King of England was never fulfilled and he had to remain satisfied with the title Lord Protector. After restora- tion his dead body was exhumed and hanged. During the Interregnum, England was ruled by the Major Generals and Colonels. They could purge the Parliament but could not get the finance, badly needed for maintaining the army. King Charles | was no benevolent ruler, rather, he was a tyrant, still the people of England did not like to be ruled by the Major Generals and Colonels against their will, because whatever might have been his vices, he rep- resented the people as their lawful King.  ",
      "569. In this connection it can be recalled what Justice Mathews emphatically stated six score years ago in the case Yick Wo vs Peter Hopkins (1885) 118 US 356 (Book 30 Law, Ed) (370), We repeat :  Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and source of law; but in our system, while sovereign powers are del- egated to the agencies of government, sover- eignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts.                And the law is the definition and the limitation of power.  History proved that whenever governance was imposed upon people without’their consent or par- ticipation, such govermance was never accepted for long.  ",
      "568. This concept of independence and liberty is not for merely gaining of independence from for- eign Ruler as we obtained independence from the British Monarch and the Emperor of India in 1947 or our owning of Liberation in 1971, The concept of independence and liberty has a deeper and greater connotation. It does not depend upon formal inde- pendence. It goes to the root of the concept of gov- ernance by the people themselves. It is based on the concept of equality that all men are equal and no one can govern others without his consent because with- out such consent, however beneficent the Ruler may be, it will be a negation of democratic spirit. Whether it is the Monarch or a Federal form of Government or a Parliamentary form of Govern- ment, all forms of governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, because the ultimate sovereignty lies with the people. This sovereignty of the people can never be ignored.  ",
      "567. Democracy is a way of life. It cannot be begotten over-night. [t cannot be handed down in a silver platter, It has to be earned. It has to be owned It has to be nurtured. The world history is replete with stories of people who fought for their rights in different names, in different countries, in different ages, but the cry for liberty, the cry for equality, the cry for fraternity, were reverbrated, may be in dif- ferent language but in the same manner from hori- zon to horizon. This sense of liberty pushed us to the war of liberation in 1971 and brought Bangladesh into existence. But the proclamation of Martial Law is negation of the said very spirit of liberty and inde- pendence of the people of Bangladesh.  ",
      "566. It appears that all usurpers seize powers though fully and wholly illegally but ironically always in the name of God and the people, But all the usurpers very conveniently forget that even in the early Seventh century Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique (R) did not seize power but relied on the confidence of the people because he believed that the blessings of God lies in the free will and consent of His cre- ation,  ",
      "565. It may be stated incidentally that in 1982, Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, ndc, psc, Chief of staff, Bangladesh Army, seized all and full powers of the Government of Bangladesh “with the help and mercy of Almighty Allah and blessings of our great patriotic people...”  ",
      "564. Nearly three hundred and fifty years later in 1958, Major General Iskander Mirza, the President of Pakistan with the aid of General Ayub Khan, the Commander in Chief of Army of Pakistan, very conveniently abrogated the Constitution, started to make laws by proclamations and set-up Martial Law Courts. And these were done by invoking in aid his “foremost duty before God and the people of Pakistan to maintain the integrity of Pakistan.” 17 (Seventeen) years later, in August 1975, Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed seized the office of President of Bangladesh “with the help and mercy of the Almighty Allah and relying upon the blessings of the people...”  ",
      "563. With this beginning, the people of England started to exercise their own right, even the right to be ruled by a King. In 1610, on the question of the power of the King to issue proclamations, the commons were agitated and ultimately the King James 1, had to yield.  ",
      "522. This action in respect of the aforesaid Act of 1907, was commenced in August, 1923, 16 years after the enactment, still Orde, J not only entertained the action but was of the opinion that the act was ultra vires the Parliament of Canada. His opinion was upheld by the Privy Council. Even after lapse of so many years, Viscount Haldane on behalf of the Board held at page- 400 : <br> “It is always with reluctance that their Lordships come to a conclusion adverse to the constitutional validity of any Canadian statute that has been before the public for years as hav- ing been validly enacted. but the duty incum- bent on the Judicial Committee. now as always is simply to intepret the British North America  Although there was no involvement or participation of the ordinary people in signing the Magna Carta but with its acceptance the King of England who used to rule by divine right, recognized for the first time the concept of ruling by ‘consent’ of the ruled, the ordinary subjects of his Kingdom. This was the beginning of the participation of the people although within a very limited class.  ",
      "521. Now let us consider a few decisions in this respect. In the case of Toronto Electric Commissioners vs Snider 1925 AC 396 PC, the question was whether the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, 1907 of Canada, was within the competence of the Parliament of Canada under the British North America Act, 1867.  ",
      "520. There is no law of limitation in challeng- ing an unconstitutional action, conduct, behaviour or acts. In such a situation, the cause of action is recurring till such acts are judicially considered. Constitutional questions are of utmost national as well as of legal interest and mere collateral observa- tion does not carry much of an importance than a bare passing remark without any conviction.  ",
      "519. The United States of America during its long and eventful history, also passed through many a turbulent periods but none of its amendments was made for anything but further advancement of civi- lization and humanity. This is the true spirit for amendment of a Constitution, the supreme law of the Republic, but not to legalise illegal acts. Its pur- pose is not to engineer or as a device to hide the ille- gal activities of usurpers or dictators but for ackies - ing further improvements, further refinements of t he constitutional position of the citizens ofa Republic. If the Court finds that the amendment 1s affected for a collateral and illegal purpose, the Court will not be slow to declare it so in exercise of its high constitu- tional duties ordained upon it.  ",
      "518. In this connection it should be remem- bered that the amendment under question is not like the Fifth Amendment of the United States providing that without indictment before the Grand Jury no one should be held liable for serious offence or other amendments of its Constitution, every one of which are beneficial to the human race. On the other hand, the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, of Bangladesh, sought to legalise and validate the Martial Law Proclamations etc. subordinating the Constitution. Each and every 28 (twenty eight) amendments of the United States Constitution, made during the last more than two hundred years of its history, was for further improvement, further advancement, further enlightenment of the constitu- tional position of its citizens, Whereas, our Fifth Amendment destroyed the very fabrics of the con- cept of justice and concept of fairness, in legalizing all illegal Martial Law Proclamations etc, While with each amendment of the Constitution, the citi- zens of the United States inched towards further refinements but with this one amendment, the citi- zens of Bangladesh immersed in the other direction.  ",
      "517. If the Constitution is wronged, it is a grave offence of unfathomed enormity committed against each and every citizens of the Republic. It is a continuing and recurring wrong committed against the Republic itself. It remains a wrong against future generations of citizens. As such, there cannot be any plea of waiver or acquiescence in respect of uncon- stitutionality of a provision or an act.  ",
      "516. Our clear and explicit answer is that mak- ing of the Constitution subordinate and subservient to the Martial Law Proclamations MLR», MLOs etc., are absolutely illegal void and non-est in the eye of law. Any attempt to legalise this illegality in any manner or method and by any Authority or Institution, how high so ever, is also void and non- est and remains so for ever.  ",
      "516. Similarly, if there is a violation of law, it remains a violation for all time to come with conse- quential and inevitable results. The law of adverse possession has got no application in case of uncon- stitutional acts and events. One must not loose sight that the Constitution is supreme and every person in the Republic, be he is a servant of the Republic or an ordinary citizen, owe his unquestionable, unquali- fied and absolute loyalty to the Constitution. Any attempt to deface the Constitution or to make it sub- servient tantamounts to the offence of sedition of worst kind. The Fifth Amendment sought to legalise such offences committed by the Martial Law Authorities and the learned the Advocates for the respondents submitted that it cannot be questioned, because those Proclamations etc, were made by the Martial Law Authorities, that the Fifth Amendment itself provided that the ratification, confirmation and the validation of those Proclamations etc. and the actions taken thereon cannot be questioned before any Court, that it is beyond question because no body challenged those in all these years, as such, deemed to be waived or acquiesced. Those argu-                ments are neither legal nor logical, Those arguments would not have been accepted even before the Star Chamber not to speak in the dawn of 21st century.  ",
      "515. This proposition is anything but correct. Conclusions or inferences based on the facts and cir- cumstances may vary with the change of social out- look or political situation but what is legally wrong remains wrong for ever.  ",
      "514. We have already found that the Martial Law Proclamations etc. not only changed the basic structure of the Constitution but also made this supreme law, subordinate and subservient to those Proclamations etc. This was also found in Halima Khatun’s case and the subsequent other decisions. Shahabuddin Ahmed, J in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury's Case himself held at para- 331: <br> “331 . Within a short time came the first Martial Law which lasted for four years, By Martial Law Proclamation Orders the Constitution was badly mauled on 10 times Secularism, one of the Fundamental State Principles, was replaced by _“Bismillah-er- Rahmar-Ar-Rahim\" in the Constitution and Socialiasm was given a different meaning Supreme Court one of the symbols of national unity was bifurcated for about two years and then was restored. All these structural changes were incorporated in and ratified as the Constitution Fifth Amendment Act. 1979\"  Let us now consider the contention that whether the vires of the Martial Law Proclamation etc. and the Fifth Amendment, has become barred by waiver and acquiescence, due to long delay in challenging those provisions. It was further contended that this delay shows that the people of Bangladesh had already accepted the Fifth Amendment, ratifying the Martial Law Proclamations etc.  ",
      "513. We have found that the Constitution is supreme. All organs of the Republic emanate from the Constitution. The Parliament can enact any law but subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The Parliament can also amend any provision of the Constitution but thereby cannot change its basic character.  ",
      "512. We have already made lengthy discus- sions above on the questions of supremacy of the Constitution, the powers of the Parliament to enact any law including amendment of the provisions of the Constitution.  ",
      "510. In this connection, the decision of the Supreme Court of India in the case of B Prabhakar Rao vs State of A.P AIR 1986 SC 210 is pertinent: <br> “23, a writ petition similar to Writ Petitions Nos. 3420-3426/83 etc. had been filed earlier and had been dismissed in limine by a Bench of this Court, We do not see how the dismissal in /imine of such a writ petition can possibly bar the present writ petitions. Such a dismissal in limine may inhibit our discretion but not our jurisdiction. So the objection such as it was, was not pursued further.” (page-227)-                 Part XXVII Waiver and Acquiescence by Delay  The next contention raised on behalf of the respondent no, 3 is that since no body challenged the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act 1979, for all these years, that was deemed to be accepted by the people and the vires of the said Act cannot now be re-opened, more so in view of the observation of Shahabuddin Ahmed, J, made in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury & Case, This observation was also noted _ and followed in rejecting the Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 . In that view of the matter, Mr Akhter Imam, Advocate, submitted that the vires of the Fifth Amendment Act, cannot now be re-opened, The learned Additional Attorney-General, though feebly but supported the said contention of Mr Imam.  ",
      "509. Under the circumstances, on both these two grounds, the contention that the present petition is barred under the principle of res judicata, has got no substance.  ",
      "507. It appears that the legality of either the Martial Law Proclamations or that of the Filth Amendment was not finally decided in the Order summarily rejecting the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994 . Such summary rejection does not debar chal- lenging of those provisions in a subsequently filed Writ petition, on the principle of res judicata, since no such issue had been raised therein or heard and finally decided by the said Court, The sine qua non for application of the principle of res judicata is the finality of a decision in an earlier action, Since no rule was issued in the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994, the summary order passed in the said writ petition in the absence of the respondents therein, do not oper- ate as res judicata in the present Writ petition.  508, Besides, the vires of the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act No. | of 1979), was not under challenge in the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994, This will also be apparent from the obser- vation of Mustafa Kamal, CJ, in dismissing the Civil Appeal No. 15 of 1997:  \" ............Also, the vires of Act No, 1 of 1979 is not under challenge in this appeal.” <br>                In the present writ petition No. 6016 of 2000, the cause-title reads as follows: \"In the matter of  Paragraph 18 of the Fourth Schedule under Article 150 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh added by the Constitu- tion (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act 1 of 1979) purported to ratify and confirm. The Abandoned Property (Supplementary Provi- sions) Regulation, 1977 (Martial Law Regula- tions No. VII of 1977) and the proclamations (Amendment) order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) inserting Paragraph 3.A to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh;”  The prayers in the present Writ petition reads as follows: <br> “(A) Pass an order or orders issuing Rule Nisi upon the respondents calling upon them as to why taking over the management of “M/s Moon Cinema” 11, Wise Ghat, Dhaka by/under Notification No. 186-S1 dated 31st December, 1971 published in the Bangladesh Gazette, Extraordinary dated 3rd January, 1972 and its place- ment with respondent No. 3 for management by Notification No. IM-  XV-36/72/531 dated 15th December, 1972 published in Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary dated 4th January, 1973 and all subsequent actions, deeds and documents relating thereto should not be declared to have been made without Jawful authority and to be of no legal effects and to further show cause as to why purported “ratification and confir- mation” of The Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation, 1977 (Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977) and Proclamations (Amend- ment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) with regard to insertion of Paragraph 3A to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution by Paragraph 18 of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh added by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act 1 of 1979) should not be declared to have been made without lawful authority and of no legal effect and as to why the respon- dents should not be directed to hand over “Moon Cinema” 11, Wise Ghat Road, Dhaka with its assets and man- agement to the petitioners.  <br> (B) ... \"  It is obvious and apparent that the issues in Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 and the issues in the pres- ent Writ Petition are altogether different. The deci- sion of the Court in Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 was in respect of the Notification dated 24-5-1977 . The Court summarily rejected the petition praying for handing over the concemed property in favour of the petitioner-company. But no Rule was issued and no issue could be said to be finally decided in the said writ petition, either in respect of the aforesaid notifi- cation or any of the Martial Law Proclamations etc. and its ratification, confirmation and validation by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979.  ",
      "506. From the plain reading of the Order dated 7-6-1994 in the Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994, it appears that the petitioner in the said writ petition prayed for a direction upon the Government of Bangladesh and another (presumably Bangladesh Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust), to make over pos- session of the Moon Cinema Hall, to the petitioners in pursuance to the above noted Notification dated 248-1977 (Annexures-D). In the said weit petition all that the petitioners wanted was to enforce the order dated 15-6-1977, passed in the earlier Writ Petition No, 67 of 1976, Butat the time of moving the petition apparently on various points, such as, the legality of Martial Law Proclamations ete, or its subsequent ratification by the FIN Amendment of the Constitution appeared to have been incidental ly raised, However, no Rule was issued cither on the specific prayer made in the Writ Petition or on any of the points of law but was summarily rejected on the basis of a passing and incidental observation made by Shahabuddin Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was), in reply to a contention raised by Mr M. Nurullah, the learned Attorney-General in Amar Hossain Chowdhury’s case, apparently without appreciating the context of that observation. Besides, Fifth Amendment was not the issue in the said case, it was not even argued by any of the par- ties in the said case.  ",
      "505. In this back-ground, the Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994, was filed but no Rule was issued and there was no appearance on behalf of the respon- dents. However, it was summarily rejected on 7-6- 1994, In the said writ petition, the cause-title reads as follows:   <br>               “In the matter of Enforcement: of Fundamental Rights as guarantend in the Constitution and for direction upon the Respondents to deliver the possession of the “Moon Cinema House” situated at MN, Wiseghat, Dhaka to the petitioners,”  The prayer of the petitioner, mrer alia, was as follows: <br> “(a) A Rule Nisi may be issued calling upon the Respondents to show cause as to why they shall not be directed to make over possession of the Moon Cinema Hall at 11, Wise Ghat, Dhaka, to the petitioners pursuant to Gazette Notifi- cation No. IND/(M-1)/4 (2)/72/11 dated 24-8-77 (Annexure-D) issued by Respondent No. 1;”  The Notification referred to above as Annexure- D. is annexed as Annexure—J in the instant Writ peti- tion as one of the annexures. It reads as follows:  “No. ND/(N-1)/4(2)/72/11 Dacca dated 24th August, 1977 NOTIFICATION  In compliance with the Honorable High Court’s Judgment dated the 15th June, 1977 in the Writ petition No. 67 of 1976, MOON CIN- EMA I], Wiseghat Road, Dacca is deleted form the list published under the Ministry of Industries Notification No. 186-SI dated 31-12- 197 and N1]. M/XV/72/531 dt. 15-12-1972 and the cinema is released in favour of the petition- er M/S. Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd, 12, Dilkusha Commercial Area, Dacca.”  ",
      "504. The contempt proceedings continued for quite a some time but ultimately withdraw in 1994.  ",
      "503. In order to understand and appreciate this plea we would hark back to 1976 . Admittedly, the petitioner company is the owner of the Moon Cinema Hall premises. The said property was declared abandoned. This was challenged in Writ Petition No. 67 of 1976 . The High Court Division, in its Judgment dated 15-6-1977, found that the said property was not an abandoned property, as such, directed release of the same in favour of the peti- tioner-company forthwith. But the respondents refused to comply with the direction of the Court on the plea that in view of the provisions of the Abandoned Property (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation, 1977 (MLR No. VII of 1977), promul- gated on 7-10-1977, the Judgment and Order of the High Court Division, stood annulled.  ",
      "502. Let us now examine on facts whether the present Writ petition is barred by the principle of res judicata.  ",
      "501. The principle of res judicata has been stated in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is a well settled principle of Jaw that if an issue was finally decided in an earlier proceeding, the same issue shall operate as res judicata, in a subse- quent proceeding between the same parties as against the same issue. The same principle applies to Writ proceedings aIso (AIR 1998 SC 2046).  ",
      "500. On the other hand, Mr Ajmalul Hossain, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, strenuously submitted that the issues involved in the Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 are entirely different from the issues involved in this writ petition. Besides, he submitted that since no Rule was issued in the said earlier writ petition but was summarily rejected the same cannot operate as a res judicata for this writ petition on which a Rule was issued on entirely dif-  ferent points of law. Dr Rafiqur Rahman, amicus curiae, in supporting Mr Hossain, submitted that the present writ petition is not barred by the principle of res judicata since any of the issues raised in this peti- tion were not finally and conclusively decided earli- er. He stressed on the ‘finality’ and ‘conclusiveness’ of the decision, if it is to be treated as res judicata.  ",
      "499. The plea of res judicata was raised on the ground that earlier the petitioners filed another writ petition being Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994 . The said writ petition although was summarily rejected but with an elaborate Judgment, considering all the issues raised in the instant writ petition, such as, the vires of the Proclamation etc. and the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution but since all those issues had already been decided in the earlier Writ Petition No. 802 of 1994, the learned Additional Attorney-General and Mr Akhtar Imam, the learned Advocate for the respondent No, 3, both submitted that the present writ petition is not maintainable as barred by the principle of res judicata.  ",
      "3. Its such plea was supported by the respondent No. 1.    ",
      "497. It appears that Paragraph 3A and 18 to the Fourth Schedule, sought to ratify, confirm, validate                and legalise all illegal and illegitimate provisions of Martial Law Proclamations, Martial Law Regula- tions and Martial Law Orders. Those Provisions and the actions taken thereon in violation of the Constitution, were not only illegal but seditious acts on the part of the Martial Law Authorities, as such, by any stretch of imagination, those provisions and the actions taken thereon come within the ambit of the word “ ” or ‘transitional’. As such, those unconstitutional provisions were wrongly and illegally thrust in to the Fourth Schedule presumably in the garb of transitional and temporary provisions and thereby a fraud has been committed on the Constitution by such amendments.  Part XXVI The Plea of Res judicata  The Plea of res judicata was raised in this writ petition on behalf of the respondent No. ",
      "496. The Constitution is a sacred document, because it is the embodiment of the will of the peo- ple of Bangladesh. It is not to be treated as a log book of Martial Rules.  ",
      "495. Article 150 is certainly not meant to be abused by the usurpers for post facto legalization of their illegal and illegitimate activities which were beyond the ambit of the Constitution, As a matter of fact, realizing that all the Martial Law Proclamations etc, were un-constitutional, they sought to make those legal by incorporating those provisions as part of the Constitution, But the Fourth Schedule is not meant for dumping ground for ille- gal provisions, Rather, what is wrong and illegal remains so for all time to come. Besides, no one can take advantage of his own wrongs.  ",
      "494. During the period between August 15, 1975 to April 9, 1979, the Constitution was made subordinate and subservient to the Martial Law Proclamations etc. The provisions of the Constitution was changed at the whims and caprices of the usurpers and dictators. We have already found that during the said period democracy was replaced by dictatorship and since November 1975, on the dissolution of the National Assembly, Bangladesh lost its republican character. Besides, Bangladesh can not even be considered independent during the said period. Earlier, it was conquered by the British Rulers, thereafter it was under the domination of the West Pakistanis. But this time, for all practical pur- poses, Bangladesh was conquered not by any for- eign invaders but by Bengali speaking Martial Law Authorities.  ",
      "493. It is very true that the Parliament by fol- lowing the procedure mentioned in Article 142, may add any provision in the Constitution so long Its basic structure is not disturbed but Article 150 is a special provision. It deals with only the transitional and temporary provisions prior to the commence- ment of the Constitution. This provision cannot be used to enlarge the Fourth Schedule, by addition of the provisions which related to the period after the commencement of the Constitution. If necessary, the Parliament may add any provision to the Constitu- tion by way of amendment, without, however, changing its basic character but cannot enlarge the Fourth Schedule by adding any provision which is not a provision made during ‘Gfeerl7’ (‘transition- al’) which ended with the enactment and commence- ment of the Constitution on December 16, 1972.  ",
      "492. In reply to our query as to how further provisions were included in the Fourth Schedule, the learned Additional Attorney-General contended that following the procedure mentioned in Article 142, further provisions were included by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, as such, those are legal and valid. But when it is pointed out to him that if the provisions which were sought to be rati- fied, confirmed and validated by the said Fifth Amendment, are found to be illegal then how the validation as well as the instrument itself by which those illegal provisions were validated would be legal, he had no answer.  ",
      "491. From these words it is so very clear that the purpose of Article 150 of the Constitution is only to protect various provisions, functions of different functionaries and all other actions taken since the declaration of independence and till the commence- ment of the Constitution. As such, the purpose of Article 150 is limited apparently only for that peri- od and for a specific purpose.  ",
      "490. The meaning of the word ‘temporary’ according to the Oxford Dictionary is ‘lasting or meant to last only for a limited time’ and according to the Chambers Dictionary is ‘lasting for a time only, transient, impermanent, provisional’.  ",
      "489. As such, the purpose of Article 150 is limited upto the commencement of the Constitution and of any period mentioned in the Fourth Schedule. The ambit of this Article can not be extended beyond the commencement of the Constitution or any period mentioned in the Fourth Schedule. In this regard we must keep in view the words ‘transition- al’ and ‘temporary’ appearing in Article 150 . In the Bengali text of the Article 150 words Tifa ‘and ‘’ are used. The ordinary dictionary mean- ing of the word ‘\" according to the Bengali Dictionary, published by Bangla Academy, 6th Edition, March, 2005, is’ and the meaning of the word  Similarly, the meaning                of the word ‘transition’ according to The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, Edited by Sara Tulloch, 1097, is ‘a passing or change from one place, state, condition, etc., to another (an age of transition’). According to The Chambers Dictionary, Deluxe Edition, Indian Edition, 1993, the meaning of the word ‘transition’ is passage from one place, state, stage, Style or subject to another.  ",
      "488. Jurisprudentially, the necessity for provi- sions for transitional and temporary provisions can- not be ignored. The provisions are generally made for the purpose of transition from the old legal order to a new one to ensure continuity of the legality of the new State. As such, of necessity, these provi- sions were made so that no legal vacuum occurs during the period from the time when a new nation came into existence till a Constitution of the said nation is framed. Obviously these provisions by its very nature, character and purpose, are of transition- al and also of temporary status and ambit. The facts, circumstances and incidents leading to the making of those interim measures were necessary for the smooth transition and continuance of the functions of the young Republic of Bangladesh as a legal enti- ty of a Republic. Those interim measures were a legal necessity and could not be avoided.  ",
      "487. These are the original provisions con- tained in the Fourth Schedule. These a prre provided in pursuance to Article 150 . These provisions were necessary to protect various laws, actions and deci- sions, made, taken or pronounced since the declara- tion of Independence on March 26, 1971.    ",
      "486. After independence, the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh was created by the elected representatives of this country, elected both in the National Assembly and also in the Provincial Assembly, held in December, 1970 and in January, 1971, in the erstwhile East Pakistan. This Constituent Assembly framed the Constitution of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh. This Constitution was enacted and commenced on December 16, 1972 . Having thus fulfilled its func- tions as the Constituent Assembly, on the com- mencement of the Constitution, it stood dissolved. This obviously was a past and closed transaction and was stated so at paragraph | of the Fourth Schedule.  Paragraph-2 of the Fourth Schedule stated about the holding of the first general election of the members of Parliament. <br> Paragraph-3 provides for continuity of the Government of Bangladesh and the laws and the powers exercised between the 26th day of March, 1971 and the commencement of the Constitution.  Paragraph—4 provides that the persons holding the office of the President of Bangladesh, the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Constituent Assembly, immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, would be deemed to hold the said office respectively till they are duly elected in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution,  Likewise, paragraph-5 provides that the per- sons holding the office of the Prime Minister and other Ministers, immediately before commencement of the Constitution, would be deemed to hold the said office, till the holding of the first general elec-                tion and appointment of the Prime Minister and other Ministers.  Paragraph-6 provides that the persons who was holding the office of the Chief Justice and every other person who held office as Judge of the High Court immediately prior to the date of the com- mencement of the Constitution, as from that date, held office as the Chief Justice and as a Judge, as the case may be. Besides, all legal proceedings, pending before the Appellate Division of the High Court and the High Court stood transferred to the Appellate Division and the High Court Division of the Supreme Court respectively.  Paragraph-7 provided for the interim rights of appeal before the Appellate Division, in respect of any judgment etc. since the 1st day of March, 1971, passed by the High Court, in accordance with the provisions of Article 103.  Paragraph-8 provided that the Election Com- mission existed immediately before the commence- ment of the Constitution and the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners were deemed to be the Election Commission and also the Election Commissioners. <br> Paragraph-9 provides for the existence of the Public Service Commission and its chairman and members and its continuance after the commence- ment of the Constitution. <br> Paragraph-10 provides for the existence of the Public Services and its continuance on the com- mencement of the Constitution. <br> Paragraph-1] provides for Oaths for the contin- uance in office. <br> Paragraph-13, 14 and 15 deal with the taxation, interim financial arrangements and audit of past accounts, - <br> . Paragraph-16 deals with the property, assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of the Government. <br> Paragraph-17 deals with the adaptation of laws and removal of difficulties for the purpose of bring-   ing the provisions of the laws in force in Bangladesh in conformity with the Constitution, within the peri- od of two years from the commencement of the Constitution.   ",
      "485. Paragraph-1 of the Fourth Schedule deals with the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. Para-] reads as follows : <br> “1 . Upon the commencement of the Cons- titution, the Constituent Assembly, having dis- charged its responsibility of framing a Constitu- tion for the Republic, shall stand dissolved.”  It may be noted that the first general election in the erstwhile Pakistan was held in December, 1970. Its pre-dominant purpose was to frame a Constitution for the entire Pakistan, The National Assembly was due to be convened on March 3, 197] but it was indefinitely postponed on March 1, 1971. This postponement of holding of the National Assembly had serious repercussions all over Pakistan specially in the erstwhile East Pakistan, The Army Rulers of Pakistan unleashed a reign of terror and a genocide on the unarmed people of the erstwhile East Pakistan. Consequently, Indepen- dence of Bangladesh was declared on the March 26. 1971, as a Sovereign Independent Republic.  ",
      "484. Both Article 150 and heading of the Fourth Schedule show that the said Article, as well as the Fourth schedule, as set out in pursuance to Article 150, deals with transitional interim meas- ures. A brief examination of the provisions original- ly contained in the Fourth Schedule with its English text, would make it clear.  ",
      "483. The heading of the Fourth Schedule reads as . Its English version is ‘Transitional and temporary provisions’.  ",
      "482. Article 150 of the Constitution provides that transitional and temporary provisions would be set out in the Fourth schedule. This provision finds its place almost at the end of the Constitution, It is preceded by Article 149, the saving clauses for the existing laws and followed by three other Articles, namely, Article 151, which deals with the repeal of certain President’s Orders, Article 152 narrates the interpretations of various words and Article 153 pro- vides the date of commencement of the Constitu- tion, its citation and authenticity.                 <br> Article 150 reads as follows :  The English Tent is: <br> “150 . The transitional_and temporary pro- visions set out in the Fourth Schedule shall have effect notwithstanding any other provisions of this Constitution.”  In pursuance to the above Article in the Cons- titution, various transitional and temporary provi- sions were set out in details in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "481. By virtue of the above two Proclamation Orders all the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs were validated and were entered in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution as paragraph 3A and 6B while paragraph 6A was inserted there earlier by Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976 . Since it was known that in the face of the Constitution, those amendments would be void ab initio, as such, amendment of the Constitution itself was made in a bid to validate those Proclamations etc. by the Fifth Amendment. <br> Part XXV Incorporation of Paragraph 3A and 18 to the Fourth Schedule : <br> Next we shall consider the legality of incorpo- ration of paragraph 3A and 18 to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "480. It should be noted that earlier the English Version of the above noted Articles were amended by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977  (Proclamations Order No. | of 1977). The preamble of the said Order reads as follows:  [Published in the Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 23rd April, 1977] <br> THE PROCLAMATIONS (AMENDMENT) ORDER, 1977. Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977. <br> Whereas it is expedient further to amend the Proclamation of the 8th November, 1975. and to amend the Third Proclamation of the 29th November 1976, for the purpose here- inafter appearing,  Now, therefore, in pursuance of the Third Proclamation of the 29th November, 1976, read with the proclamations of the 20th August 1975, and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator in pleased to make the following order : <br> By the above Order, only the English version of the relevant provisions of the Constitution were amended leaving the original authenticated Constitution in Bengali intact. Presumably on detec- tion of this lapse, the relevant Articles of the Constitution in Bengali, were again amended by The Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978). This Order, however, started with the following false pretexts stated earlier above for the amend- ments contained in the preamble: <br> THE SECOND PROCLAMATION (FITEENTH AMENDMENT) ORDER, 1978, Second Proclamation Order No, IV of 1978. <br> Whereas there has been persistent demand for the repeal of the undemocratic provisions of the Constitution incorporated therein by the Constitution by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975:                 <br>           AND <br> Whereas some of such undemocratic pro- visions have already been repeated by the Presi- dent and the Chief Martial Law Administrator, <br> AND <br> WHEREAS the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator, in response to the said popular demand pledged to the nation to repeal the remaining undemocratic provisions after obtaining mandate from the people in the election to the office of President and he has obtained that mandate; <br> AND <br> WHEREAS it is expedient further to amend the Proclamation of the 8th November, 1975, for the purposes of fulfilling the said pledge and other purposes hereinafter appearing;  Now, therefore in pursuance to the Third Proclamation of the 29th November, 1976, read with the Proclamations of the 20th August, 1975, and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator is pleased to make the following Order: (The underlinings are mine)  The pretexts to amend the Constitution in the above manner in the garb of repealing the undemo- cratic provisions of the Constitution incorporated therein by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975, was altogether misconceived. Firstly because the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, whatever its political merits or demerits, it was brought about by the representatives of the people by an overwhelming majority members of a sover- eign Parliament. Secondly, however undemocratic, the Fourth Amendment may appear to an army com- mander, the amendment of the Constitution, could not be made even by the President or the CMLA or  any person, how high so ever, but only by a Parliament. Thirdly, Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc being an usurper to the Office of the President and in the Office of the legally non-exis- tent Chief Martial Law Administrator, had no authority to change the Constitution. As an Officer of the Defence Services, he took oath to protect the Constitution of Bangladesh, but instead, on April 23. 1977, only two days after assuming the office of President, he illegally and without any lawful authority amended the various provisions of the Constitution which were the fundamental basis for the struggle for Liberation, by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, and made the secular Republic of Bangladesh, a theocratic State, thereby the cause of the Liberation War of Bangladesh was betrayed.  ",
      "479. Jn pursuance to the above Order the orig- inal Bengali text of the part of the Preamble, Articles 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 25(2) and the Proviso to Article-38 were amended on the false pretext of persistent demand to repeal the undemocratic provisions although the aforesaid provisions are all the glorious basic features of the Constitution and had no nexus with the Fourth Amendment. All these changes of the basic structures of the Constitution were sought to be ratified, confirmed and validated by the Fifth Amendment apparently by playing fraud upon the members of the Second Parliament.  ",
      "478. Those Martial Law Proclamation Orders of 1975, 1976 and 1977 were incorporated in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution by its amend- ment as Paragraph 3A. The English versions of the provisions discussed above were changed, deleted and modified by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. | of 1977). The Bengali versions of those very provisions were subsequently added, deleted or amended by The Second Proclamations (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978).  ",
      "477. We have discussed above the various provisions of the Constitution. Those provisions were not only the basic features of the Constitution but were also the ideals for the struggle for libera- tion, the comer stone of our Constitution. Those ideals were the basis for the birth of the Republic of Bangladesh. But those basic features of the Constitution were changed by the various Martial Law Proclamations.  ",
      "476. With the same object to destroy the secu- lar character of the Republic and its Constitution. the proviso to Article 38 was omitted by the Second Proclamation (Sixth Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. III of 1976). The ginal Article-38 with its proviso reads as follows:  The English Text is : <br> “38 . Every citizen shall have the right to form associations or unions, subject to any rea- sonable restrictions imposed by law in the inter- ests of morality or public order:  Provided that no person shall have the right to form, or be a member or otherwise take part in the activities of, any communal or other asso- ciation or union which in the name or on the basis of any religion has for its object, or pur- sues, a political purpose.”  The above noted proviso to Article-38 was meant to protect the secular character of the Republic of Bangladesh in spite of one’s fundamen- tal right to form an association as envisaged in Article-38, but the above proviso was omitted by the Second Proclamation Order No. III of 1976, made by Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, a nomi-                nated President of Bangladesh and CMLA. Since the secular character of the Republic was one of the objectives of the struggle for liberation, the omis- sion of the aforesaid provision from the Constitution, as a bid or devise to change its such basic character, tantamounts to changing of the basic feature of the Constitution,  ",
      "475. The efforts to high light the secular Bangladesh into a Muslim country were even made clear from addition of clause 2 to original Article-25 of the Constitution, The original Article-25 was as follows:                The English Text is : <br> 25 . The State shall base its international rela- tions on the principles of respect for national sover- eignty and equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, peaceful settlement of international disputes, and respect for international law and the principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter, and on the basis or those principles shall— <br> (2) strive for the renunciation of the use of force in international relations and for general and complete disarmament; <br> (b)uphold the right of every people freely to determine and build up its own social, economic and political system by ways and means of its own free choice; and <br> (c)support oppressed peoples throughout the world waging a just struggle against imperialism, colonialism or racialism.  But by the Proclamations Order No. | of 1977, clause-2 was added: <br> “2 . The state shall endeavor to consolidate, preserve and strengthen fraternal relations among Muslim countries based on Islamic soli- darity.”  This clause-2 is redundant. The original Article- 25 itself provides for promotion of international peace, security and solidarity amongst all the nations including of course, the Muslim countries, in accordance with the charter of the United Nations. As such, its endeavor to foster further rela- tions amongst only with the Muslim countries based on Islamic solidarity, as stated in the added clause- 2, can only be explained by its leaning towards becoming an Islamic Republic from a Secular Republic and thereby destroying its one of the most important and significant basic feature of our Constitution, namely, secularism.  ",
      "474. Secularism was one of the ideals for which the ‘struggle for liberation was fought and own and the framers of the Constitution in their wis- dom in order to dispel any confusion, upheld and protect the said ideal of secularism as spelt it out in Article-12 of the Constitution as one of the funda- mental principles of State Policy. Indeed this was one of. the most important basic features of the Constitution. But the said basic feature of the Constitution was deleted by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978 and thereby sought to change the secular character of the Republic of Bangladesh as enshrined in the original Constitution.  ",
      "473. Article-12 dealt with secularism and free- dom of religion. Article-12 reads as follows: The English Text is :  12 . The principle of secularism shall be realized by the elimination of— <br> (a) communalism in all its forms; <br> (b) the granting by the State of political sta- tus in favour of any religion; <br> (c) the abuse of religion for political pur- poses; <br> (d) any discrimination against, or persecu- tion of, persons practicing a particular religion. <br> This provision of secularism explained and expounded in Article 12, is one of the most impor- tant and unique basic features of the Constitution, Secularism means both religious tolerance as well as religious freedom. It envisages equal treatment to all irrespective of caste, creed or religion but the State must not show any form of tilt or leaning towards any particular religion either directly or even remotely. It requires maintenance of strict neutrality on the part of the State in the matters of different religions professed by various communities in the State. The State must not seen to be favouring any particular religion, rather, ensure protection to the followers of all faiths without any discrimination including even to an atheist. This is what it means by the principle of secularism.  ",
      "472. Next we shall consider the omission of Article 12 altogether from the Constitution by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977.  ",
      "471. In this connection, it should be remem- bered that a provision in the Constitution gives only the basic law with wide ideas and the Parliament enacts laws to give effect to those ideas. If we exam- ine the substituted Article-9 and Article-10 it would appear that Article-11 read with Article 59 and 60 and Article-2§ serves the purposes of those two sub- stituted provisions very well and as a matter of fact those two Articles are redundant and apparently were substituted only to camouflage the original Article-9 and the original Article-10 which were two hasic features of our Constitution.  ",
      "470. We have a shrewed suspicion that the substituted Article-9 and Article-10 were incorporat- ed in the Constitution only as an excuse for deleting the original provisions because both the substituted provisions are well provided for, Article-11 read with. Articles 59 and 60 covers the substituted Article-9 while Article-28 takes care of the substi- tuted Article-10.                ",
      "469. Without going into the merit of the sub- stituted Article 10, we admit that we do not find any plausible reason to delete such a glorious provision for the salvation of fellow human being.  ",
      "468. This substituted provision has no nexus with the original provision which spelt out estab- lishment of a socialistic economic system and exploitation free society for Bangladesh. The people of Bangladesh dreamt of such a society for ages. In order to establish such an idealistic society the peo- ple of Bangladesh gave their lives. As such, the pro- vision containing such idealism, very rightly found its place in the Constitution as one of the fundamen- tal principles of State Policy. This being one of the basis for our struggle for liberation, this provision was one of the basic structures of the Constitution.  ",
      "467. This is one of the fundamental ideals on which the struggle for national liberation was fought, as such, spelt out in the Constitution as one of its basic structures. But the Proclamations Order No. | of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, deleted the said magnanimous pro- vision and substituted it with the following: <br> “10, Steps shall be taken to ensure partici- pation of women in all spheres of national life.” <br> This Provision provides for participation of women in national life but this is already well pro- vided for in Article 28, as such, this substitution was unnecessary and redundant.  ",
      "466. The original Article 10 contained the pro- vision for socialism and freedom from exploitation. This Article reads as follows:  The English Text ts: “10, A socialist economic system shall he established with a view to ensuring the attain. ment of a just and egalitarian society, free fron the exploitation of man hy man.”  ",
      "465. We have olready seen the Article 9 above in the original Constitution before its amendment. Afier amendment by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977, the substituted Article 9 reads as follows : <br> “9 . The state shall encourage local Government institutions composed of represen- tatives of the areas concerned and in such insti- tutions special representation shall be given, as far as possible, to peasants, workers and women.”  The substituted Article 9 is in respect of promo- tion of local Government institutions but Articles 11, 59 and 60 adequately provided for such institu- tions, as such, this substitution was unnecessary. The new provision, however important it may appear but cannot delete the basis of our Banglaee nationalism, contained in original Article 9, for which the people of Bangladesh fought for libera- tion and martyrs made their supreme sacrifices. The original Article 9 glorified our Bangalee Nation- hood, possibly for the first time in our history, in recognitig@n of such nation-hood, the Constitution emblemed it as one its basic structures but its dele- tion by a Proclamation Order constituted a betrayal 1o the freedom fighters and the three million martyrs and an insult to our Nation-hood.  ",
      "464. We fail to understand why Article 9 bad to be repealed completely and possibly in order to camouflage the repealed Article, it was substituted with a new one which has no nexus with Bangalee nationalism.  ",
      "463. Our history shows that their anxiety was not for nothing but was painfully correct because Proclamations Order No, | of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, deleted Article- 9 altogether, containing the basis of Bangali nation- alism. This portion of the Proclamation Order did                exactly what the Pakistani Military Janta wanted to do in Bangladesh in 1971 . The similarity of inten tions is so stark that it makes one tart with surprise  ",
      "462. In this historical context, the framers of the Constitution in their anxiety, specifically spelt out the basis of Bangalee nationalism in the Constitution so that there should not be any confu- sion about their entity as Bangalee. Because, they had apprehensions like Justice Davies that this country may not always ‘have wise nd human rulers auuWicked men, ambitious _of power, with, hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may till the places’  ",
      "461. This provision glorified our concept of Bangalee nationalism. The framers of the Constitution in their wisdom, thought it necessary to specifically spell out the basis of Bangalee national- ism in the Constitution itself. There may be many reasons for it. One reason may be that from time immorial, this part of the world which is known as Bengal during British regime was continuously invaded by Shok, Hun, Pathans, Moguls and lastly by the English. As such, the Bangalees although retained their entity through their literature and cul- tural heritage but always governed by the people other than Bangalees. That is one of the reasons, Bengal voted so much in favour Muslim League in 1946 election on the Pakistan issue but even after independence from British yoke, in no time, their enthusiasm got a jolt when Mr Jinnah declared at Dhaka in 1948 that Urdu would be the only state- language of Pakistan. This was followed by a long history of conspiracies to cripple the majority East Pakistan economically, politically and also to destroy their cultural heritage and above all their pride the Bangalee Nationalism but instead, with the rise of oppression, Bangali nationalism got new exu- berance. The Pakistani Military Janta instead of sct- tling the issues politically unleashed the worst geno- cide in the history of mankind. One of their prime objectives was to destroy and sweep away our Bangalee nationalism from root, once for all and make the Bangalees a hundred percent Pakistani. In order to achieve such an ill-advised end they did not only hesitate to kill millions of innocent Bangalees and plunder: their belongings but also did their best to change their identity as Bangalee.  ",
      "460. This concept of Bangalee nationalism was further expounded and explained in the original Article 9 of our Constitution. The original Article 9 reads as follows: <br> The English Text is : <br> “9 The unity and solidarity of the Bangalee nation, which, deriving its identity from its language and culture, attained sover- eign and independent Bangladesh through a united determined struggle in the war of inde- pendence, shall be the basis of Bangalee nation-  alism.”  ",
      "459. Since this unwanted change of identity from ‘Bangalee’ to ‘Bangladeshi’ does not commen- surate with our national entity, this amendment goes to the root of our Bangalee nationalism.  ",
      "458. The inhabitants of this part of the world irrespective of their cast, creed and religion were known as Bangalees from time immemorial. In their lighter moments they laugh as a Bangalee, in their despair they cry as a Bangalee, they record their feelings in Bangla, their history, their philosophy. their culture, their literature are all in Bangla. These finer features of life and intellects gave them an identity as a race in India for more than thousand years. This was so recorded in the memoirs of Hiuen Tsang, Ibn Batuta and many other travellers. Even during the reign of Emperor Akbar, this part of his empire was known as ‘Sube Bangla’. As such, this identity as a Bangalee was not a mere illusion or frivolous idiosyncrasy but has a definite character which separated them from other races in Pakistan. The identity of Punjabees, Pathans etc might have faded away in their new identity as Pakistanees but the Bangalees consciously kept their separate entily in their culture and literature inspite of their                Pakistani citizenship. This was their pride. Their such entity as Bangalee blooms in their weal and woe. This sentiment may not have strict legal value but this very sentiment of Bangalee nationalism paved the way to the ultimate independent Bangla- desh which has a very definite legal existence. As such, nobody, how high so ever, must not ignore or under-value the words ‘Bangla’ or ‘Bangalee’ hecause since 1952, beginning with the martyrs of language movement, thousands of Bangalees gave their lives for their right not only to speak Bangla but also to live as such Bangalee. It is their basic right and very naturally, their Constitution recog- nised it.  ",
      "457. Next is Article 6 of the Constitution. declaring the citizenship of Bangladesh. The origi- nal Article 6 reads as follows: <br> The English text is: “6 . (1)Citizenship of Bangladesh shall be determined and regulated by law; <br> (2) The citizens of Bangladesh shall be known as Bangladeshis.” <br>  In this manner, the Bangalees, by 4 Procla- mation Order lost their identity as a Bangalee and over-night became Bangladeshi, due to the whims of an army commander.  ",
      "456. As such, from the discussions made above, it is very clear that the Proclamations Order No. | of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, destroyed the basis of our struggle for freedom and also changed the basic character of the Republic as enshrined in the Preamble as well as in Article 8(1) of the Constitution.  ",
      "455. Shahabuddin Ahmed, J in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury’ case evaluates Constitution in this manner at para-272, page-118 : <br> “On the one hand, it gives out-lines of the state apparatus, and aspirations of the people; it gives guarantees of fundamental rights of a cit- izen and also makes him aware of his solemn duty to himself, to his fellow citizen and to his country”.  No wonder his Lordship did not see any role of religion in the Constitution itself.  ",
      "453. Bangladesh came into being with the basic concepts of nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism. As such, its Constitution was framed with those ideals in view. It was never intended to be a theocratic State. Rather, it was one of the major reasons for the Bangalees for their cost- ly struggle for liberation.  454, In this connection it should be noted that the obligation of the State, in this respect, is to ensure that all persons in the Country can perform their respective religious functions. Besides, the State is to ensure that no discrimination is made between the followers of one religion over the other.  ",
      "452. According to Thomas Paine, the purpose of the Constitution is : <br> \"A Constitution is not the act of govern- ment, but of a people constituting a _govern- ment, and a government without a constitution is power without right......A constitution is a thing antecedent to a government; and a _gov- ernment is only the creature of a constitution.” (1792) (Quoted from Hilaire Barnett on Consti- tutional And administrative Law, Fourth Edi- tion, 2002, Page-7).  (The underlinings are mune)  According to O Hood Phillips, the purpose of the Constitution is : <br> “The Constitution of a State in the abstract sense is the system of laws, customs and con- ventions which define the composition and powers of organs of the state, and regulate the relations of the various state organs to one another and to the private citizen. A “Constitution” in the concrete sense is the doc- ument in which the most important laws of the                 constitution are authoritatively ordained.\" (Quoted from O. Hood Phillips’ Constitutional and Administrative Law, Seventh Edition, 1987, at page-5). (The underlinings are mine)  From the discussions made above on the con- cept of written Constitution it would appear that this instrument is predominantly for the purpose of reg- ulating the rights and obligations of the people vis- d-vis the State and vice versa but it has got nothing to do with the religious beliefs of its people.  ",
      "451. Such belief would reside with the people in accordance with their free will and shall never be interfered with, either by the State or any section of the population, however majority they may be. Such a secular concept would be inhibited in a modern democratic Constitution unless, of course, it is a theocratic State.  ",
      "450. In this connection it should be remem- bered that the purpose of a Constitution is not to describe the tenets of a particular religion but is an Instrument creating the high institutions of the Republic and its relationship with its people. A Constitution upholds and guarantees such dignity to the people of the Republic with its own rights and also its obligations to the Republic in a broader sense but the religion of a particular section or sec- tions of people shall neither required to be high- lighted nor be interfered with in an ideal and model democratic form of Republic. The Constitution of such a Republic would never contain or refer to a particular faith but would leave such faculties with the people themselves. Bangladesh was dreamt of as a secular country and came into being as a secular country, as such, its Constitution was framed on that ideal, but any change from such a basis would con- stitute a change of the basic structure of the Constitution.  ",
      "449. As such, the framers of the Constitution, from their earlier bitter experience during the Liberation War, gave effect to the above lofty ideals of our martyrs which were reflected in the Preamble and Article 8(1) and other provisions of our Constitution. Those are the basic structures of the Constitution which were changed on replacement of the provisions of the original Preamble and Article 8(1) by the Proclamation Order No. | of 1977 and Second Proclamation Order No. JV of 1978, but such replacements changed the secular character of the Republic of Bangladesh into a theocratic State,  ",
      "448. Of necessity and being forced, the unarmed simple minded Bangalees of the then East Pakistan took up arms and rose against the tyranny for their survival. After Liberation, such oppression and persecution on the Bangalee population was very much fresh in their minds. They were deter- mined to establish an independent sovereign nation based on the democratic principles of.equality and social justice where nobody will be discriminated on the ground of religion.  ",
      "447. But the high ideals of equality and fra- ternity so very gloriously enshrined in Islam could not spare the majority population of the erstwhile East Pakistan from total discrimination in all spheres of the State without any exception. The erst- while East Pakistan was treated as a colony of West Pakistan and when voice was raised praying for al least near equal treatment, steam roller of oppres- sion was perpetrated on the people of the Eastem wing. After a long 23 years, the first general election in Pakistan was held in 1970 with one of the objects, to frame a Constitution. The National Assembly was                scheduled to be convened at Dhaka on March 3, 1971, but General Yahya Khan, the President and CMLA postponed the Assembly, forcing the country into turmoil. Thereafter, on the night following March 25, 1971, General Yahya Khan and his mili- tary government unleashed the worst genocide in the history of mankind on the unarmed people of the erstwhile East Pakistan, and the ‘valiant’ armed forces of Pakistan brutally killed millions. The vast majority of the people of this part of the world are God-fearing Muslims but their religion could not even save the fellow Muslims from being persecut- ed, Killed and raped and their belongings being plun- dered and all ironically in the name of Islam.  ",
      "446. It may be noted that in pursuance to the Indian Independence Act, 1947 (Act 10 & 11 Geo. IV Ch.30), British-India was partitioned and India and Pakistan, emerged as two independ Dominions. It is true that partition was made, more or less on the basis of religion but India declared itself as a secular nation. Mr Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the first Governor General of Pakistan, although in his first speech made on September 11, 1947, hinted that in Pakistan people of all religion would be equal without any religious discrimination but its first Constitution, made in 1956, declared the country as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Constitution of 1962 made no difference. Pakistan, since the death of its first Governor General, reduced itself into a theoretic nation as happened in medieval Europe.  ",
      "445. In line with the change made in the sec- ond paragraph of the preamble, Article 8(1) was also changed. The original Article 8(1) reads as follows:  The English Text is : <br> “8.(1)The principles of nationalism, social- ism, democracy and secularism, together with the principles derived from them as set out in this Part, shall constitute the fundamental prin- ciples of state policy.”  The amended version reads as follows:  The English Text as amended is : <br> “8.(1)The principles of absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah. nationalism. democracy and socialism meaning economic and social justice. together with the principles derived from them as set out in this Part, shall constitute the fundamental principles of state policy.”  (1A) Absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions.”  ",
      "444. The original preamble clearly show that one of the four fundamental basis of our nation- hood wes secularism but the amended Preamble specially the second paragraph show that the word ‘secularism’ wes deleted from the preamble. Since ‘secularism’ is one of fundamental basis of our Liberation War and the nation-hood of Bangladesh, its omission changed the basic character of the Constimition.  ",
      "443. A plain reading comparing the original Preamble with the amended one would un-mistak- ably show certain basic changes were made by the above Order.  ",
      "442. The original second paragraph of the Preamble reads as follows:  The English Text is : <br> “Pledging that the high ideals of national- ism, socialism, democracy and secularism, which inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves to, and our brave martyrs to sacri- fice their lives in, the National Liberation strug- gle, shall be the fundamental principles of the Constitution;”  But after amendment by The Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978), as inserted in the 2nd Schedule, it reads :  The English Text is : <br> “Pledging that the high deals of obsolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah, national- ism, democracy and socialism meaning eco- nomic and social justice, which inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves to, and our                          brave martyrs to sacrifice their hives in, the war for national independence, shall be the funda- mental principles of the Constitution”  The above amendment was inserted by the Proclamations (Amendment Onder, 1977 (Proclama- tions Order No. 1 of 1977).  ",
      "441. In the first paragraph of the Preamble in the original Constitution the words ‘a historic war for national independence’ were substituted for the original words ‘a historic struggle for national liber- ation’, The second paragraph of the preamble was entirely substituted for the second paragraph con- tained in the original Constitution.  ",
      "439. The words, commas and brackets ‘BIS- MILLAH-AR-RAHMAN-AR-RAHIM (In_ the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful) were inserted before the word ‘PREAMBLE’ by the above Order.  440.’ The Constitution, however, starts with the Preamble. This was also noticed by the Appellate Division in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case at para-48 (BLD).  ",
      "438. The English text of the changes of the various provisions of the Constitution were made by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) while the Bengali versions of those very changes and few oth- ers were made by the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978).  ",
      "437. We shall now deal with the provisions of the Constitution which were replaced by the new ones in pursuance of those Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. It is necessary to discuss those provi- sions of the Constitution with purported amend- ments because those were also ratified and validated by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979. This is also required in order to understand the legality of the provisions sought to be ratified by the said Fifth Amendment.  ",
      "435. But the Second Parliament validated those void and non-est provisions including the Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation, 1977 (Martial Law Regulation No. Vil of 1977), by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act | of 1979). As such, we have to con- sider the legality not only of Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 but the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977, (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) and also the vires of the aforesaid Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, which                  purported to ratify and confirm those Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs including the MLR VII of 1977. <br> Part XXIV Amendments in the Constitution <br> But by the Proclamation dated August 20, 1975, the Constitution although was retained but it was made subordinate and subservient to the Proclamations, the MLRs and MLOs. We have already held above that those Proclamations, the MLRs and the MLOs are void and non-est in the eye of law.  ",
      "434. Since our Apex Court in a number of cases as discussed above found as a fact that the Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations and Orders issued from time to time since August 20, 1975, till April, 1979, made the Constitution of Bangladesh subordinate and subservient to those Proclamations. MLRs and MLOs, are void ab initio and non est in the eye of law.  ",
      "433. Before we conclude our discussions on the supremacy of the Constitution we would like to quote from the treatise; ‘American Jurisprudence’ second Edition (1998) Vol 16 published by West Group, USA at pages: 344 to 349: <br> “1 . Definition and nature of “constitu- tion” and “constitutional law,” generally <br> 5 . Generally The United States is a constitutional democracy. The constitutional form of govern- ment as it exists in the United States is based on the fundamental conception of a supreme law, expressed in written form,’ in accordance with which all private rights must be determined and all public authority administered.  Constitutional government by the people represents the greatest and grandest struggles of humanity for its betterment, and in its accom- plishment marks the uttermost political accom- plishment of the human race, The limitations imposed by the American system of constitu- tional law on the action of the governments, both state and national, are deemed to be essen- tial to the preservation of public and private rights, notwithstanding the representative char- acter of our political institutions. In the United States, the right of sovereignty is vested in the people and is exercised through the joint action of the federal and state governments.  From the above rather lengthy discussions it is firmly and undeniably established that: <br> (i) The Constitution is the supreme law in Bangladesh; (ii)All great Institutions of the Republic, namely the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary are the creations of the Constitution; <br> (iii) All functionaries of the Republic are the the creatures of the Constitution; <br> (iv)The services of the Republic including the defence services are the creatures of the Constitution; <br> (v) As such, all the Institutions, functionaries and the services of the Republic, owe its existence to the Constitution and whol- ly and fully bound by its edicts.  <br> (vi)The existence of the country as a Republic is dependent on its Constitution.   Nobody can deny the above incidents of supremacy of the Constitution.  ",
      "432. Shahabuddin Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was), also in the Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case upheld the supremacy of the Constitution in the following manner at para-272 page-118 ;  “In this case we are to interpret a Constitution which is referred to as the will of the people and supreme law of the land and as such it is a most important instrument. But its                  pre eminence is not derived only from the fact that it is the supreme law of the land. it is pre- eminent because it contains lofty principles and is based on much higher values of human life. On the one hand, it gives out-lines of the State appa- ratus, on the other hand, it enshrines long cher- ished hopes and aspirations of the people; it gives guarantees of fundamental rights of a citizen and also makes him aware of his solemn duty to him- self, to his fellow citizen and to his country.\"  This is how our Apex Court upholds and acclaims the supremacy of the Constitution and we are bound to follow it.  ",
      "182. ECS Wade and G Godfrey Phillips in Constitutional and Administrative Law consid- ered the question of the doctrine of legislative supremacy. The authors pointed out that the doctrine of legislative supremacy distinguishes the United Kingdom from those countries in which a written constitution imposes limits upon the legislature and entrusts the ordinary courts whether the acts of the Legislature are in accordance with the Constitution. It is observed: <br> “In a constitutional system which accepts judicial review of legislation, legislation may be held invalid on a variety of grounds: for example. because it conflicts with the separa- tion of powers where this is a feature of the Constitution, (Liyanage vs R [1967] AC 259) or infringe human rights guaranteed by the Constitution, (EG Aptheker vs Secretary of State 378 US 500 (1964) (Act of US Congress refusing passports to Communists held a unconstitutional restriction on right to travel) or has not been passed in accordance with the pro- cedure laid down in the Constitution (Harris vs Minister of Interior 1 952(2) SA 428).  ",
      "431. His Lordship again held that our Constitution is a written constitution and that again a rigid one. In upholding the supremacy of the Constitution his Lordship quoted with approval the following at para-]81-182 page-92-93 : <br> “181 . KC Wheare says: “Constitutional Government_means something more than Government according to terms of a Constitution. It means Government_according to rule as opposed to arbitrary Government, it means Government limited by terms of a Constitution not Government limited only by the desire and capacity of those who exercise powers”. He says there might be country with Constitution and the Constitution does more than establish institutions of government and left them act as they wish. He observed: <br> “In such a case we would hardly call the Government Constitutional Government. The real justification of Constitutions, the original idea behind them is that of limiting Government and of requiring those who govern to conform to the law and usage. Most Constitutions as we have been seen do purport to limit the Gvernment “and_if_in turn a constitution imposes restriction upon the powers of the insti- tution it must _be said” then the courts must decide whether _their actions transgress those restrictions and in doing so, the Judge must say what the Constitution means.”  Professor Wheare was quoted further;  “The substance of the matter is that while it is the duty of every institution established under the authority of a Constitution and exercising powers granted by Constitution, to keep within the limits of those words, it is the duty of the Court from the nature of their function to say what these limits are? and that is why courts come to interpret a Constitution”. (Page 174, Modern Constitution).  ",
      "148. Professor Wheare further mentioned that once a Constitution is enacted, even when it has been submitted to the people for approval, it binds thereafter not only the institutions which it establishes, but also the people itself: They may amend the Constitution, if at all, only by methods which the Constitution itself provides (Page 89- 90). He further says “A Constitution cannot be disobeyed with the same degree of lightearted- ness as a Dog Act. It lies at the basis of political order: if it is brought into contempt, disorder and chaos may soon follow” ( P 91).  This nation has learnt its bitter lessons to the consequence of disobedience of the Constitution.  (The underlinings are mine).                 We have already seen above how Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc, the three usurpers treated our Constitution. This Constitution was writ- ten on the blood, toil and tears of millions of Bangalees but this was treated not even as one ‘Dog Act’ or “Rat Act’, they treated it most disgracefully although all of them took oath to ‘preserve, protect and defend’ the said very Constitution but even a plane ticket gets more attention and care from a chance traveller to Bangladesh than what Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed etc. did to our Constitution.  ",
      "147. Professor KC Wheare in Modern Constitutions quoted Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist when he said:  There is no position which depends on clearer principles than that every act of a dele- gated authority, contrary to the tenor of the Commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm that the de is greater than his prin- cipal: that the servant is above his master, that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid. And he con- cludes that “the Constitution ought to_be_pre- ferred to the Statute, the intention of their agents”  ",
      "146. Professor Baxi while talking about Indian Constitution said that the Supreme Court reiterated that what is supreme is the Constitution \"neither Parliament nor the judici- ary is by itself supreme. The amending power is but a power given by the Constitution to Parliament; it is a higher power than any other given to Parliament but nevertheless it is a power within and not outside of. the Constitution .... Article 368 is one part of the Constitution. It is not and cannot be the whole of Constitution\". (See Indian Constitution Trends and Issues at Page- 123). ",
      "430. Regarding supremacy of the Constitution and its amendment his Lordship further held at para- 145-148, page-83-86 <br> “145 . Jt does not need citation of any authority that the power to frame a Constitution is a primary power whereas a power to amend a rigid constitution is a derivative power derived from the Constitution and subject at least to the limitations imposed by the prescribed proce- dure. Secondly, laws made under a rigid consti- tution, as also the amendment of such a consti- tution can be ultra vires if they contravene the limitations put on the law making or amending power by the Constitution, for the Constitution is the touch stone of validity of the exercise of the powers conferred by it. But no provision of the Constitution can be ultra vires because there is no touch stone outside the Constitution by which the validity of a provision of the Constitution can be judged. (See MH-Seervai, Constitutional Law of India at page-(1522-23),  ",
      "429. It will be apparent that from the very beginning the framers of the Constitution dreamt of a democratic form of Government, not a Martial Law Government or a dictatorship or an autocratic form of Government. B.H.Chowdhury, J, held at para-47 Page-58: <br> “It will be noticed that the proclama took notice of the “Mandate” for framing a Constitution for the Republic so as to ensure “equality, human dignity and social justice” and a democratic form of Government.”  ",
      "428. It may be recalled that on the night fol- lowing March 25, 1971, independence of Bangladesh was proclaimed. It was followed by a formal Proclamation of Independence. It was issued o April 10, 1971, from Mujibnagar. It reads as fol- lows: <br>               THE PROCLAMATION OF INDEPENDENCE Mujibnagar, Bangladesh Dated 10th day of April, 1971 <br> WHEREAS free elections were held in Bangladesh from 7th December, 1970 to 17th January, 1971, to elect representatives for the purpose of framing a Constitution,  AND  WHEREAS at these elections the people of Bangladesh elected 167 out of 169 representa- tives belonging to the Awami League,  AND  Whereas General Yahya Khan summoned the elected representatives of the people to meet on the 3rd March, 1971, for the purpose of framing a Constitution,  AND  WHEREAS the assembly so summoned was  arbitarily and illegally postponed for an indefi- nite period.  AND Whereas instead of fulfilling their promise and while still conferring with the representa- tives of the people of Bangladesh, Pakistan authorities declared an unjust and treacherous war, <br> AND  Whereas in the facts and circumstances of such treacherous conduct Banga Bandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the undisputed leader of 75 million of people of Bangladesh, in due fulfill- ment of the legitimate right of self-determina- tion of the people of Bangladesh, duly made a declaration of independence at Dacca on March 26, 1971, and urged the people of Bangladesh to defend the honour and integrity of Bangladesh, <br> AND  WHEREAS in the conduct of a ruthless and savage war the Pakistani authorities committed and are still continuously committing numerous acts of genocide and unprecedented tortures, amongst others on the civilian and unarmed people of Bangladesh,  <br> AND  Whereas the Pakistan Government by levy- ing an unjust war and committing genocide and by other repressive measures made it impossible for the elected representatives of the people of Bangladesh to meet and frame a Constitution, and Give to themselves a Government, <br> AND  Whereas the people of Bangladesh by their heroism, bravery and revolutionary fervour have established effective control over the terri- tories of Bangladesh,  In respect of the above Proclamation BH Chowdhury, J (as his Lordship then was) held in the case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury etc vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD(spl) 1 at para-43 page-57: “This declaration envisages the following: <br> (a) Because of the unjust war and genocide by the Pakistani authorities it became “impossi- ble for the elected representatives of the people of Bangladesh to meet and frame a Constitution” although General Yahya Khan summoned the elected representatives earlier “to meet on the 3rd March, 1971 for the purpose of framing a Constitution”; <br> (b) The elected representatives duly consti- tute them self into a Constituent Assembly because of the “mandate given to us by the peo- ple of Bangladesh whose will is supreme” <br> (c) It declared Bangladesh to be sovereign people’s Republic in order to ensure “equality, human dignity and social justice. <br> (d) Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was declared to be President and Syed Nazrul Islam Vice-President “till such time as a Constitution is framed”; <br>               (e) President or in his absence the Vice- President “shall have the power to appoint a Prime Minister and such other Ministers as he considers necessary”. It was the presidential system that was envisaged; <br> (f) President or in his absence the Vice- President “shall have the power to summon and adjourn the Constituent Assembly.”  ",
      "427. We have already quoted the Proclama- tions and some of the MLRs and MLOs above in the beginning of our present discourse. We have analysed the findings of our Apex Court made in the cases of Halima Khatun, Haji Joynal Abedin. Ehteshamuddin Ahmed, Nasiruddin and Anwar Hossain Chowdhury. From the analysis of Procla- mations, MLRs and MLOs scrutinised above and the findings of our Apex Court as stated above, it is crystal clear that the Constitution was made subor- dinate and subservient to the Proclamations dated August 20, 1975, November 8, 1975 and November 29, 1976 and the MLRs and MLOs made thereun- der, as such, ultra vires to the Constitution. There is no provision which is ‘Supra Constitutional’ or to put it mildly, ‘Extra Constitutional’. All laws or pro- visions and actions taken thereon must without any exception, conform to the Constitution. Any law or provision which is beyond the ambit of the Constitution, is ultra vires and void, as such, non-est in the eye of law. The doubtless supremacy of the Constitution is far above all Institutions, Functionaries and services it created.   ",
      "426. It is to be noted that amongst the three pillars of the Republic it is the Supreme Court which is privileged to declare the Majesticity of the Constitution and in having such a privilege, it is not the Constitution rather it is the Supreme Court which is honoured. The Constitution 1s supreme not because it is written on parchment papers but because it is the embodiment of the will of the peo- ple of the Republic. The Constitution of Bangladesh was born with such supremacy since it was adopted and enacted on November 4, A972 . The Supreme Court only declares its such existing supremacy.  ",
      "425. One may say that this is not Bible. Of course, it is not Bible. While the Bible has got uni- versal application and governs the mode of life of all persons in the World holding Christian faith, the Constitution governs the life of all persons within the Republic irrespective of caste, creed, religion and applies to persons of all faiths and even to athe- ists.  ",
      "424. The Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh declares its own supremacy in the above manner. It does not need any aid from any of the Institutions it created to declare its such eminence. It remains sublime for all time to come.  ",
      "423. Keeping in view these saga of unfortu- nate national hara kiri, we have to examine our Constitution, the most sacred document in any coun- try.  ",
      "422. We, however, neither approve nor accept such 2 base treatment of our Constitution, the Supreme law of the land.  ",
      "421. They are all intelligent people. They knew very well that the Proclamations ete. are al illegal and so also their activities. As such, they again came round and sought to hide all their ille- galities in the bosom of the said very Constitution which they disgraced time and again in their free wills, whims and caprices. In their such pursuits, ironically, there was no dearth of hypocrisy in that although the Dictators freely truncate and modify the various provisions of the Constitution all the time to suit their ends but when those very illegal Proclamations etc. become part of our sacred Constitution, those become unchallengable, as argued by the learned Advocates for the respon- dents.  ",
      "420. There is no existence of Martial Law Authorities or the Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations or Orders in our Constitution or any of the laws of the land. Those authorities or the Proclamation etc. are quite foreign to our jurispru- dence. Still those Proclamations etc. were imposed on the people of Bangladesh. Those have got no legal basis. Those are illegal and imposed by force. The people are constrained to accept it for the time being, not out of attraction or its legality but out of fear, As such, it has got no legal acceptance, The Martial Law Authorities were also fully aware of it, as such, some times, they hold a referendum for one person and they invariably get almost cent percent votes, as in the cases of Field Marshal Ayub Khan and Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc. The Martial Law Authorities some times abrogate the Constitution, as in the case of the abrogation of 1956 Constitution by Major General Iskender Mirza, President of Pakistan, and 1962 Constitution by General Yahya Khan, Chief Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan, Some times, the                Constitution is suspended and made subservient to the Proclamations etc. as in the case Proclamations by Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Muhammad Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc.  ",
      "419. In the same manner, the Prime Minister and other Ministers, The Chief Adviser, The Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Chief Justice and other Judges of the Supreme Court, pledge to ‘pre- serve, protect and defend the Constitution’.  ",
      "418. Under this provision of the Constitution the President of the Republic is required to take an oath or affirmation as stated in the Third Schedule in  the following manner :  English Text is as follows :  1 . The President.—An oath (of affirmation) in the following form shall be administered by the ‘(Chief Justice]- <br> I ............................... , do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of President of Bangladesh accord- ing to law:  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to Bangladesh:  That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution:  And that I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.”  (The underlinings are mine)  In his oath or affirmation, the President of Bangladesh pledges that he will ‘preserve, protect and defend the Constitution’.  ",
      "417. But the Constitution is supreme, The Constitution itself proclaims so. The Supreme Court said so in the AT Mridha’s case and also in the case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury etc vs Bangladesh,  First the Constitution. In paragraph-4 of the Preamble it is emphatically Proclaimed :  The English Text is : <br> “Affirming that it is our sacred duty to safeguard, protect and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodi- ment of the will of the people of Bangladesh so that we may prosper in freedom and may make our full contribution towards international peace and co-operation in keeping with the pro- gressive aspirations of mankind.\" (The underlinings are mine)  Article 1, Article 7 and Article 21(1) of the Constitution, affirms the supremacy of the Constitution.  After the Preamble, the Constitution com- mences in this manner with Article 1 :  Part I THE REPUBLIC <br> 1 . Bangladesh is a unitary, independent, sovereign Republic to be known as the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.  Article 7 reads as follows :  The English Text is : <br> “7 . (1) All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the                 people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution, <br> (3) This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other Jaw shall, to the extent of the inconsisten- cy, be void.”  Article 21(1) reads as follows: <br> “21 . (1) It is the duty of every citizen to observe the Constitution and the laws, to main- tain discipline, to perform public duties and to protect public property.”  Besides, Article 148(1) Provides for making an oath or affirmation by the persons elected or appointed to an office mentioned in the Third Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "416. Similar question had also been faced by Hamoodur Rahman, CJ in the case of Asma Jilani vs                Government of Punjab PLD 1972 SC 139, This is how his Lordship dealt with the problem at page- 202-03 : <br> “The learned Attomey-General however, insists that even this regime had received the legal recognition of this Court and, therefore, It had also acquired de jure authority to make laws. Reference in this connection has been made to two decisions, The first was in the case of Muhammad Ismail vs State (1) in which the judgment was delivered again by myself. The only question raised in this case was as to whether after the promulgation of Martial Law on the 25th of March 1969, and the enactment of the Provisional Constitution Order on the 4th of April 1969, this Court continued to retain the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Constitu- tion of 1962 to entertain petitions for special leave to appeal in criminal proceedings in view of the fact that the Provisional Constitution Order did not specifically provide for any appeal by special leave. No question was raised in this case as to the validity of the Martial Law or of the Provisional Constitution Order. The only question argued was whether on a proper construction of the language of this order an appeal for special leave in criminal proceedings was still within the competence of this Court. The Court held that upon a proper construction of the terms of the Order the Jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals by special leave in criminal matters had not been taken away and that the jurisdiction given to it by Article 58 of the 1962-Constitution remained unaffected. There was no question, therefore, of any con- scious application of the mind of the Court to the question of the validity of the regime or the legality of the Provisional Constitution Order nor was this Court called upon to give any deci- sion thereon as the latter order had manifested no intention to alter that jurisdiction and there was no conflict between the two. It is not cor- rect, therefore, to say that this decision in any way constitutes a conscious recognition in law of the new regime. The next case referred to is that of Mian Fazal Ahmad vs State (2). In this case, which was a petition for special leave from an order of the Lahore High Court dismissing an applica- tion under section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashment of certain criminal proceedings pending investigation by the police;_the High Court had admitted the any challan in any Court. The police did not do so but instead of submitting a challan before a Criminal Court placed the matter before a Military Court and the latter convicted the peti- tioner. Thereupon the petitioner moved the High Court, for taking action against the DSP in contempt for disobedience of its order. The High Court dismissed the application of the petitioner and this Court by a very brief order dismissed the petition for special leave observ- _ ing that “when the Military Court took cog- nizance of the offence and imposed a penalty on the petitioner learned Judge in the High Court was right in dismissing the petitioner’s applica- tion under section 56l-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure” No other reason was given for the order.  Again, this does not show that the legality of the order of transfer of the case to the Military Court was over challenged, The High Court’s order was upheld possibly on the ground that the proceedings which were sought to be quashed by the original petition having . been terminated by the transfer of the case to the Military Court, there was no further need of its quashment, and no question of commitment of the DSP in contempt arose, as he had not vio- lated the order of the High Court. In these cir- cumstances, it can hardly be urged that this con- stitutes a conscious legal recognition of the mil- itary regime of 1969 . Questions in dispute in these cases were it entirely different and had nothing whatever to do with the question now before us. It is incorrect, therefore, to say that this Court had given any legal recognition to the                regime of General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan,  The question, therefore, is still at large and has for the first time now been raised before this Court in this specific form. The learned Attorney-General's contention that even the tacit approval given by this Court by not ques tioning suo motu the various Martial Law Regulations made by the regime concemed dur- ing this period of 2 1/2 years is it self sufficient to preclude this Court from going into this ques- tion now, is not in my opinion, tenable. The Courts, as I have already indicated are not called upon to suo motu raise a controversy and then decide it, They can only do so if a litigant  raises the controversy in a concrete form, as it has now been done before us. “The Court”, says Mr Eaton Drome, “has authority to expound the Constitution only in cases presented to it for adjudication. Its Judges may see the President usurping powers that do not belong him, Congress exercising functions it is forbidden to exercise, a State asserting rights denied to it. The Court has no authority to interfere until its office is invoked in a case submitted to it in the manner prescribed by law.” (Vide Marriot English Political Institutions, 1938 Edn, P, 293).  We have seen from the opinions of our Apex Court given in the cases of Halima Khatun, Haji Joynal Abedin, Kh. Ehteshamuddin, Nasiruddin and Anwar Hossain Chowdhury that the Martial Law Proclamations etc, made the Constitution a bunch of worthless sheaf of papers.  ",
      "415. In Nasiruddin’s case, the issue was whether the writ abated, in view of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 read with paragraph 4 of Martial Law Regulation No, VII of 1977 . This case has got no nexus with the Fifth Amendment.   ",
      "414. Besides, at paragraph 25 of the Judgment it is categorically stated that neither the authority of the person who proclaimed Martial Law nor the vires of the Martial Law Regulations was chal- lenged in the said case. °  ",
      "413. It is not, since the vires of the Fifth Amendment was not under challenge in any of those two appeals,even indirectly. The issues involved in those two cases were no where near the Fifth Amendment.  In Ehteshamuddin s case the issues were : <br> (i) Whether the proceedings of the Special Martial Law Court could be examined after the enactment of the Fifth Amendment and the Proclamation made on April, 7; 1979 by the CMLA, withdrawing the Martial Law and revoking the earlier Proclamations. <br> (ii) The extent of protection given under the Fifth Amendment. (iii) Whether — the decision of the Government can be called in question under Article 102 of the Constitution despite the Proclamation of April 6, 1979.  It is apparent that the vires of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution was not under chal- lenge in any of the above cases. This is also admit- ted by the learned Additional Attomey-General and also the learned Advocate for the respondent No. 3.  ",
      "412. A question although was not raised but yet may arise that since those two cases were decid- ed after the enactment of the Fifth Amendment whether it can be said that the Appellate Division approved the FiNh Amendment, at least impliedly.  ",
      "411. In Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case, the Appellate Division found :  The Constitution was retained as a statute subordinate to the Martial Law Proclamations, Orders and Regulations.  In this connection it should be noted that the case of Kh Ehteshamnddin Ahmed vs Bangladesh 33 DLR (AD) 154 was decided on 27-3-1980 and the case of Nasiruddin vs Government of Bangladesh 32 DLR (AD) 216 was decided on 14-4-1980 . Both the cases were decided after the Fifth Amendment was passed on April 6, 1979, by the Second Parliament.  ",
      "410. In Haji Joynal Abedin’ case, the Appel- late Division found; <br> (i) The Constitution was reduced to a posi- tion subordinate to the Proclamation, <br> (ii) The unamended unsuspended Constitu- tional provisions were allowed to con- tinue subject to the Proclamations and MLRs and MLOs, <br>               (iii) The Constitution was amended from time to time by issuing Proclamations. <br> (iv) The moment the country is put under Martial Law, the Constitution looses its superior position. <br> In Ehteshamuddin’s case, the Appellate Division found : <br> (i) The Constitution continued subject to the Proclamations. <br> (ii)The Supremacy ‘of the Constitution cannot by any means compete with the Proclamation. <br> (iii)The Chief Martial Law Administrator would not be deemed to be a person holding an office of profit in the serv- ice of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. <br> (iv)The High Court lost its superior power to issue writ against the Martial Law Authority or Martial Law Courts. <br> In Nasiruddin’s case, the Appellate Division found that the expression ‘purported exercise’ in the validating clause of Fifth Amendment cannot give protection of an act, which is coram non judice, from being challenged.  ",
      "409. In the case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury etc. vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD (Spl) 1, Shahabuddin Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was), considered the Constitution during Martial Law in this manner at para-272, page-118: <br> “Bangladesh which got Independence from Pakistan through a costly War of independence, which was fought with the avowed declaration to establish a democratic polity under a highly democratic Constitution met the same fate as Pakistan. Two Martial Laws covered a period of 9 years Out of her 18 years of existence. During these Martial Law periods the Constitution was not abrogated but was either suspended or retained as a statue subordinate to the Martial Law Proclamations. Orders and Regulation.\"  Let us now examine the findings of our Apex Court in respect of the Proclamations, the Martial Law and our Constitution.  It was held in the Halima Khatun’s case: <br> (i) Under the Proclamations, the Constitution lost its character as the supreme law of the Republic. <br> (ii)The Constitution is subordinate to the Proclamations and the Regulations and Orders made thereunder. <br> (iii) Constitution is superior to any law other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation. <br> ",
      "408. The next is the case of Nasiruddin vs Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh 32 DLR (AD) 216 . This case was decided on 14-4- 1980 . It is also in respect of an abandoned property. It modified the effect of the decision of the earlier Halima Khatun s case to some extent but the obser- vations of Fazle Munim, J, in respect of the status of Martial Law vis-a-vis the Constitution made in the said decision, remained unaltered. Kemaluddin Hossain, CJ, however, held at para-10, page 221: <br> “It is to be observed that when an authori- ty is vested with a jurisdiction to do certain acts and in the exercise of that jurisdiction he does it wrongly or irregularly the action can be said to be done within the purported exercise of his jurisdiction. But an act which is manifestly without jurisdiction, such as the property which not being an abandoned property within the meaning of Presidential Order 16 of 1972 is declared to be so, or in case of judicial or quasi judicial act which is coram non judice, the use of the expression ‘purported exercise’ in the validating clause of fifth amendment of the Constitution cannot give such act the protection from challenge, it being ultra vires, It is true mala fide act is also not protected, but then mala fide is to be pleaded with particulars constitut- ing such mala fide and established by cogent materials before the Court.”  That very question is before us for considera- tion as to whether Fifth Amendment can give pro- tection from challenge the actions of Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc., none of whom were qualified to become the President under the Constitution,  ",
      "407. It is apparent from the above Judgement that the effect of the proclamation was that the Constitution is supreme only when the Martial Law is not near by and even long after the lifting of the Martial Law, on the face of its bare shadow, the Constitution with its 'supremacy' becomes a worth-   less sheaf of papers. Whether we like it or not the status of the Constitution was reduced to such an ignoble shambles by the Proclamations, the MLRs and the MLOs which would have blushed even Henry VIII or Louis XIV. During the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th Century, the Proclamations were issued by the King but in pursuance of an Act of Parliament and no prerogative right to issue procla- mation was allowed even to the King of England by the Chief Justice Coke four hundred years ago in 1610.  ",
      "18. In that case. on the question of High Court's power under the Constitution to issue writ against the Martial Law Authority or Martial Law Courts, this Division has given the answer that the High Courts, being creature under the Constitution with the Proclamation of  Martial Law and the Constitution allowed to remain operative subject to the Proclamation and Martial Law Regulation, it losess its supe- rior power to issue Writ against the Martial Law Authority or Martial Law Courts .... \" <br> His Lordship further held at para-25 page-166: \"25 . Before I proceed further it may be mentioned that in the present case neither the  authority  of the person who proclaimed Martial Law nor the vires of the Martial Law Regulation was or could be challenged at the  bar excepting arguing on the question of supremacy of the Constitution over the Proclamations and Martial Law Regulations. Since the authority of the Chief Martial Law Administrator is not challenged and the vires of the relevent Martial Law Regulation is also not challenged. I do not find any good reason for making reference to Asma Jilani's case ...... \" (The underlinings are mine)  From the above Judgement it is apparent that even after lifting of the Martial Law, its provisions remained supreme and on the face of the MLRs, the Constitution was relegated even further to the back- seat. Although at that time the Martial Law was not there but even then the Constitution was real sub- ject to the Martial Law and was made to recoil on the face of the bare shadow of the MLRs.  ",
      "406. In considering Ehteshamuddin's Case his Lordship held at Para - 18 page - 163 : <br> \"",
      "405. At that time although Martial Law was withdrawn still its dark shadows apparently loomed large over the country and its Constitution, as found by the Court. His Lordship Ruhul Islam. J, in con- sidering Article-7, help at pera-16 page-163: <br> \" It is true that Article 7(2) declares the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Republic and if any other law is inconsistent with the Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void, but the supremacy of the Constitution cannot by any means compete with the Proclamation issued by the Chief Martial Law.... \" (The underlinlings are mine)  ",
      "404. In this case, the vires of the Fifth Amend- ment was not challenged. This position was admit- ted by the learned Advocates of both the sides, the Court considered the legality of the proceedings before the Special Martial Law Court when the country was under Martial Law Court. The Judgement of the Appellate Division was given on March 27, 1980.  ",
      "403. Leave was granted, inter alia, to consider  as to whether the proceeding of the Special Martial Law Court could be examined by the High Court Division after passing of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.  ",
      "402. By this time, Proclamations were revoked and the Martial Law was withdrawn.  ",
      "401. The next is the case of Kh. Ehtesham- uddin Ahmed vs Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) 154 . In this case a writ petition was filed challenging the proceedings in passing the Judgment and Order of conviction passed by the Special Martial Law Court. The Proclamation etc. were not challenged. The High Court Division summarily rejected the writ petition by an order dated June, 13, 1979, on the ground of ouster of jurisdiction by MLR 1 of 1975.  ",
      "400. This opinion of the Appellate Division  was given on Decembers 20, 1978 . At that time the  country was under Martial Law.  ",
      "399. After tracing the history of the Proclamation of Martial Law, declared on August 20, 1975 at page-16 and 17 of the Report, Ruhul Islam, J, held para-18, page-122 : <br> “From a consideration of the features noted above it leaves no room for doubt that the Constitution though not abrogated, was reduced to a position subordinate to the Proclamation inasmuch as, the unamended and unsuspended constitutional provisions were kept in force and allowed to continue subject to the Procamation and Martial Law Regulation or orders and other orders; and the Constitution was amended from time to time by issuing Proclamation. In the face of the facts stated above I find it difficult to accept the arguments advanced in support of the view that the Constitution as such is still in force as the supreme law of the country, untrammelled by the Proclamation and Martial Law Regulation ........ \" His Lordship further held at para-19 : p-122-23 :  \" ...............  So long the Constitution is in force as the supreme law of the country, any act done or proceeding taken by a person purport- ing to function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority may be made the subject matter of review by High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, The moment the country is put under Martial Law, the above noted constitutional provision along with other civil laws of the country loses its superior position. \" (The underlinings are mine)  His Lordship very specifically spelt out that the Constitution was reduced to a position subordinate to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs.                ",
      "398. Leave was granted, infer alia, to consider as to whether in view of the Proclamation dated August 20, 1975, the High Court Division acted within its jurisdiction in issuing the writ.  ",
      "397. The second case is State vs Haji Joynal Abedin 32 DLR (AD) 110 . In this case a writ petition was filed challenging the legality of the order of conviction passed by the Special Martial Law Court. The legality of Proclamations etc. was not the issue in that case. The High Court Division declared the said order of conviction and sentence was without lawful authority and of no legal effect.  ",
      "396. This appeal was decided on January 4,1978 . Bangladesh was at that time under Martial Law. After considering the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and also the Constitution including Article 7, Fazle Munim, J (as his Lordship then was), observed at para-18 : <br> \" ....................... what appears from the Proclamation of August 20, 1975 is that with the declaration of Martial Law in Bangladesh on August 15, 1975, Mr Khondker Moshtaque Ahmed who became the President of Bangladesh assumed full powers of the                 Government and by Clause (d) and (e) of the Proclamation made the Constitution of Bangladesh, which was allowed to remain in force, subordinate to the Proclamation and any Regulation or order as may be made by the President in pursuance thereof. In Clause (h) the power to amend the Proclamation was pro- vided. It may be true that whenever there would be any conflict between the Constitution and the Proclamation or a Regulation or an Order the intention, as appears from the language employed, does not seem to concede such supe- riority to the Constitution. Under the Proclama- tion which contains the aforesaid clauses the Constitution has lost its character as the Supreme law of the country. There is no doubt, an express declaration in Article 7(2)of the Constitution to the following effect : “This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void.” Ironically enough, this Article, though still exists, must be taken to have lost some of its importance and efficacy. In view of clauses (d), (e) and (g) of the Proclamation the supremacy of the  Constitution as declared in that Article, no longer unqualified. In spite of this Article, no Constitutional provision can claim to be sacro- sanct and immutable. The present Constitutional provision may however, claim superiority to any law other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation.”  However unpalatable it may appear to us Fazle Munim, J, very crudely narrated that the Consti- tution of Bangladesh was made subservient and sub- ordinate to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs.  ",
      "395. The first is the case of Halima Khatun vs Bangladesh 30 DLR (SC) 207 . In the said case, the legality of the Proclamations etc. was not the issue but inclusion of a property in the list of abandoned properties was challenged in the High Court. The Rule was discharged on the ground that the question as to whether the relevant property was abandoned or not is a disputed question of fact. On appeal question arose before the Appellate Division, whether in view of the provisions of the Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation 1977, (MLR No. VII of 1977) the aforesaid writ petition abated.  ",
      "394. Now let us examine a few decisions of our Supreme Court where the status of the said Proclamations MLRs and, MLOs have been consid- ered.  ",
      "393. However, for our purpose, it is not that necessary either. We only wanted to see what kind of Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs were ratified con- firmed and validated by the Fifth Amendment. Because, the Second Parliament ratified confirmed ted all those Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution by insertion of paragraph 18 in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, without referring even to the headings of those Proclamations etc. not to speak of giving of details which were sought to be ratified but stated in an omnibus manner although every Bill ought to have spelt out with all and every details with dates of every provision which are going to be the part of the Constitution, the most sacred instru- ment a nation may have but it did not. It is alleged that this lapse alone was enough to declare it invalid. The legal aspect of this lapse we shall consider later.  ",
      "392. During the period from August 20, 1975 to April 9, 1979, hundreds of MLRs and MLOs were issued. Copies of only some of those are furnished by the learned Advocate for the petitioner. We have referred only to some of those Proclamation Orders, MLRs and MLOs above.  ",
      "391. But the proclamation of Martial Law is altocether a different matter. There was no law in Bangladesh which can allow the President or any- body on his behalf to declare martial law in Bangladesh, still, after the murder of the President by a section of army officers and men, Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, seized the office of President and declared Martial Law on August 20, 1975 . This Martial Law was continued by Justice Sayem, the next President, nominated on November 6, 1975 . He also assumed the office of CMLA. In due course, Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc, took over firstly as CMLA and thereafter, on April 21, 1977, as the next President again on nomination but he con- tinued as such CMLA till April 7, 1979.  ",
      "390. Although some of the fundamental rights may be suspended during the proclamation of emer gency but it is not the Proclamation of Martial Law. Besides, the proclamation of emergency must be approved by the Parliament within 120 days, other- wise it would automatically lapse. As a matter of fact, emergency was in existence since November, 1974 and continued till November, 1979.  ",
      "389. In case of a grave emergency in which the security or economic life of Bangladesh or any of its part is threatened by war or external aggres- sion or internal disturbance, the President may, with the advice of the Prime Minister, issue a proclama- tion of emergency. Such a proclamation, however, requires prior counter signature of the Prime Minister.  ",
      "388. Article 141A was not in the original Constitution. It was added by the Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1973 (Act XXIV of                1973). It provides for proclamation of emergency. It is still in the Constitution.  ",
      "387. The learned Advocates, however, submit- ted that the President had the power under Article 14]A to issue a proclamation of emergency and such an emergency was continuing at the relevant time.  ",
      "386. But we are not aware of any legislation allowing declaration of Martial Law by the President of Bangladesh, even under the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975 . The learned Advocates of both the sides could not show any legislation which could allow the President to apply Martial Law in the morning of August 15, 1975, even under the Fourth Amendment but that was done under the Proclamation,  ",
      "385. This was the position in the original Constitution of Bangladesh but the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975, made the office of the President executive Head of the Government. Although, since August 20, 1975, the Constitution was freely changed and badly mauled many a times but the position and status of the President was never changed rather, strengthened from time to time, obviously to suit the usurpers. However, by the Constitution (Twelfth Amendment) Act, 1991 (Act XXVIII of 1991), the present Parliamentary form of Government was again restored.  ",
      "384. In Bangladesh in contradistinction to US Constitution, although President is the head of the State and also the Supreme Commander of the defence services but he is not the executive head of the Government while the U.S. President is the executive head of the Republic and also the Commander-in-Chief of all the forces. This is one of the distinguishing features of the constitutional posi- tion of these two countries. Like US, Bangladesh has a rigid Constitution but unlike US, it has a par- liamentary form of government with the Prime Minister as its executive-head.  ",
      "383. The safe-guard exercised by the Congress in 1861 is still fully effective and opera- tive even now without slightest demur either from the President or from the defence forces or from any other quarter, rather, it appears that they would feel uneasy had it been otherwise. There neither the President nor the members of the Defence Forces feel themselves detached from the people, rather, it is engrossed in their minds that they belong to the people and above all they are the sons of the soil. This outlook highlights the democratic spirit of the people of the United States.  ",
      "382. Professor Edward S. Corwin, in his book, ‘The Constitution And What It Means To-day’ (Sixth Edition, 1938) considered the position in this manner at page-55-56 : <br> ................... In its measures for raising and supporting armies and for providing a navy, Congress may dictate the purposes for which these may be used. But so far as the statutes do not limit his discretion, and so long as he does not exceed the appropriations voted by Congress, the President may employ the armed forces of the United States as may seem to him best for the purpose of enforcing the laws of the United States and of protecting the rights under International Laws of American citizens abroad.  The limitation of appropriations for the army to two years reflects the American fear of standing armies.” (The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "381. Although the Congress by legislation allows the President with necessary powers during war-time but the purse of the Republic always remains with the Congress. The relevant portion of Section 8 under Article 1 reads as follows : <br> “....But no appropriation of money to that use (raise and support armies) shall be for a longer term than two years;”  It appears that ultimate control remains with the Congress.  ",
      "380. In this connection, it should be noted that the President of the United States, an elected civil-                ian person being the Commander-in-Chief of all the defence forces, is the symbol of civilian authority and highlights the democratic principle of civilian supremacy.  ",
      "379. Same is the position in the United States. It is the Congress which is charged with the mainte- nance of the defence forces. But during the state of war the Congress by legislation may authorize the President to take appropriate actions including the proclamation of martial law. We have already dis- cussed above that even such Martial Law is not above the law but justiciable before the Court.  ",
      "378. In England with the Petition of Right, 1628, the power of the Crown to apply martial law in England was abolished. However, outside the United Kingdom in the colonies and even in Ireland martial law was applied during war, insurrection or rebellion. During the First and Second World Wars also martial law was applied. But even in all these war situations where civil authorities ceased to func- tion, Martial Law was applied with legislative sanc- tions only under the authority of the Crown. It should also be noted that the members of the defence services in the United Kingdom serve dur- ing the pleasure of the Crown.   ",
      "377. Under Rule 8 of the Army Rules, the Oath or Affirmation to be taken on attestation is in following form : <br> FORM OF OATH <br> I............. , swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful to Bangladesh and its constitu- tions and bear true allegiance to the President of Bangladesh that I will honestly and faithfully serve in the Bangladesh Army, that I will go wherever I may be ordered by land, air or sea, and that I will observe and obey all commands of any officer set over me even to the peril of my life. <br> FORM OF AFFIRMATION <br> I........................ , do solemnly affirm that I will be faithful to Bangladesh and its constitu- Bangladesh that I will honestly and faithfully serve in the Bangladesh Army. that I will observe and obey all commands of any officer set over me even to the peril of my life.  (Quoted from the book ‘A Manual of Defence Laws in Bangladesh’ Vol. Il. First Edition, 1976, edited by ATM Kamrul Islam).  Similar are the provisions in the Navy Ordinance, 1961 (XXXV of 1961) and the Air Force Act, 1953 (Act Vi of 1953) regarding appointment, terms and conditions of service and the disciplinary matters.  We have gone through the constitutional provi- sions with regard to the defence services and also the above noted provisions made for regulating the said services. We have also gone through Articles 48, 49, 55 and 56 but could not find any power enabling either the President or the Prime Minister to apply martial law in any part of Bangladesh.  ",
      "376. Section 15(1) provides for oath or affir- mation for 2 person who is to be attested. Sub-sec- tion 2 provides for the form of oath or affirmation which contains among others a promise that the per- son to be attested will be faithful to Bangladesh and its Constitution and bear true allegiance to the President of Bangladesh.  ",
      "375. The Army Act with Rules made thereun- der provides for appointment, enrolment and attesta- tion, terms and conditions of service, offences and various kinds of punishment, Courts Martial, sen- tences and its execution and other related and ancil- lary matters.  ",
      "374. The Pakistan Army Act, 1952, was enact- ed on May 13, 1952 and came into effect on April 1, 1952 . The Act has been extended to the whole of the erstwhile Pakistan by the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 (21 of 1960) with effect from October 14, 1955 . This Act repealed the Indian Army Act, 1911 among others. This Act has been accepted as the necessary legislation for Bangladesh Amny with the deletion of the word ‘Pakistan’ wher- ever appearing and with other amendments as and when found necessary.  ",
      "373. The Defence Services of Bangladesh includes the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Each of these services were created under the specific provisions of law, namely, The Army Act, 1952, The Air Force Act, 1953 and The Navy Ordinance, 1961. Those laws were in existence when Independence of Bangladesh was proclaimed on the March 26, 1971 and by the Laws Continuance Enforcement Order, made by the acting President on April 10, 1971 at Mujibnagar, all laws those were in force in Bangladesh on March 25, 1971, would subject to the Proclamation, continued to be so in force. After Liberation of Bangladesh, on the commencement of the Constitution on December 16, 1972, the afore- said Order was repealed under Article 151(a) but by Article 149, subject to the Constitution all existing laws, continued to have effect.                ",
      "372. Under Article 63, only with the assent of the Parliament, war may be declared or the Republic may participate in war, otherwise not.  ",
      "371. However, it is the Parliament, under Article 62, which regulates the defence services by legislation in respect of its raising and maintenance including its reserve and auxiliary forces, granting of commissions, the appointment of the Chief of Staff of all the defence services and the terms and conditions of their service.the discipline and other related matters.  ",
      "370. Article 61 confers the President with the Supreme Command of the defence services of Bangladesh. Such command shall, however, be exercised by law to be made by the Parliament. Besides, the President, under Article 48(3), general- ly exercises all his functions and acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.  ",
      "369. According to our Constitution, the President is the head of the State while the Prime Minister is the Head of the Government.  ",
      "368. Article 56(1) provides for a Prime Minister of the Republic, Article 55(2) provides that the executive powers of the Republic shall be exer- cised by or on the authority of the Prime Minister,  ",
      "367. Article 48 of the Constitution provides that there shall be a President of Bangladesh. He shall be elected by the members of Parliament.  ",
      "366. In the Constitution of Bangladesh, Part IV starts with the broad heading ‘The Executive.’ Chapter I under Part IV deals with Office of ‘The President’, Chapter II] deals with ‘The Prime Minister and The Cabinet’, Chapter IV deals with ‘The Defence Services’.  ",
      "365. As such, the Martial Law declared on August 20, 1975, had no semblance of legal basis or excuse of any sort and was absolutely illegal under all forms of jurisprudence.  ",
      "364. In the morning of August 15, 1975, in Bangladesh, the learned Additional Attorney- Genera] admitted, there was no rebellion or civil war or insurrection or riotous activities in Dhaka or in any other parts of the country, from any quarter other than the said very section of the armed forces with whose active collaboration Khandaker Moshtague Ahmed, seized the office of the President of Bangladesh. Apparently, the said Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed and his band of rene- gades, themselves are the perpetrators of the distur- bance in the country. The Courts were not closed, rather the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was ousted by the Martial law Proclamation. The coun- try was not attacked by any foreign invaders or there was no disturbance inside the country except those created by the perpetrators of Martial Law them- selves.  ",
      "363. In the case of State of Bihar vs Bal Mukund Sah (2000) 4 SCC 640, the question was whether the State Legislature, totally ignoring the  High Court, can enact a statutory provision, intro-  ducing a scheme of reservation in the subordinate               judiciary. In highlighting the basic structure doctrine SB Majumder, J., observed at para - 32: <br> \"'32.It is true, as submitted by leaned  Senior Counsel, Shri Dwivedi for the appellant  State that under Article 16(4) the State is  enabled to provide for reservations in services.  But so far as “Judicial Service™ is concerned, the Governor,  such reservation can be made by in exercise of his rule-making power only after  consultation with the High Court But so long as it is not done, the Legislature cannot,  by an indirect method, completely by passing the High Court and exercising its legislative power, circumvent and cut across the very scheme of recruitment and appointment to the District Judiciary as envisaged by the makers of the Constitution. Such an exercise, apart from being totally forbidden by the constitutional  scheme, will also fall foul on the concept relat- ing to “separation Of powers between the   Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary” as well as the fundamenta| concept of an “inde- pendent Judiciary™ Both these concepts are now elevated to the level of basic structure of the Constitution and are the very heart of the  constitutional scheme”(Page - 683 - 4).  To Sum-up: <br> (i) The Constitution of Bangladesh is an ‘autochthonous’ Constitution. This is a  rigid or controlled and an organic  _ instrument. <br> (ii) “The pith and substance of a legislation’ s crucial. It is for the Court to probe  whether it is legal or invalid and ‘the Court must not decline to open its €yes to the truth’. <br>  (iii) The Constitution clothes the Parliament with the general power to legislate on  any matter but this is subject to the fun- damental limitations formulated in the  Constitution and the specific procedure stipulated therein.                             (iv) The President or any body else has got no power to amend the Constitution. <br> (v) Parliament may amend a provision of the Constitution following the neces- sary procedure but can neither abrogate it nor suspend it or change its basic fea-  ture or structure. <br> (vi)  The power to destroy is not a power to amend. <br> (vii) The ‘law’ in Article 7 is conclusively d to include an amending law. An amending law becomes part of the Constitution but an amendment, cannot be valid if it is inconsistent with the  Constitution. <br> (viii) Article 142 merely  confers the enabling power for amendment but cannot swal- low the constitutional fabrics. <br>  (ix) The fabrics of the Constitution cannot be dismantled even by the Parliament which is a creation of the Constitution  itself.   <br>     (x) The amendments of the Constitution  must be tested against Article 7 since such power of the Parliament is given by the Constitution itself, as such, must reside  within the ambit of the Constitution and itself not beyond it.  (xi) The power to amend under Article 142   is wide but is not that wide to abrogate the Constitution or to transform its democratic republican character into one of dictatorship or monarchy or 10 legalise illegalities.  (xii) Sovereignty of the people, supremacy of the Constitution, Rule of Law, Democracy, Republican form of Government, Unitary State, Separation of powers, Independence of the judiciary. Fundamental Rights, Secularism, aré the basic structures of the Constitution.  (xiii) The Court has got power to undo an amendment if it transgresses its limit and alters a basic structure of the Constitution, If an Act of Parliament conflicts with the Constitution, it has the duty to say that the Act is not law.  Part XXIII Constitution Vis-a-vis Martial Law: Bangladesh  ",
      "362. The power of Judicial review, vested in the High Court and Supreme Court, as a basic fea- ture of the Constitution, was examined by AM Ahmedi, CJI in the case of L Chandra Kumar vs Union of India AIR 1997 SC 1125, at para - 78.  ",
      "361. BP Jeevan Reddy, J also gave a separate but concurring Judgment highlighting the concept of Rule of Law and secularism as basic features of the Constitution of India.  ",
      "358. In considering the concept of secularism, Sawant, J., held at para -88: <br> “88.These contention inevitably invite us to discuss the concept of secularism as acceplt- ed by our Constitution. Our Constitution docs not prohibit the practice of any religion either privately or publicly. ...... Under Articles 14, 15 and 16, the Constitution prohibits discrimina- tion against any citizen on the ground of his religion and guarantees cqual protection of law and cqual opportunity of public employ-  ment.(Page-2000).............   The State is enjoined to accord equal treatment to all religions and religious sects and denomi- nations. (Page- 2000),...... »  ",
      "357. In the case         of SR Bommai vs Union of India AIR 1994 SC 1918 various aspects of the Constitution of India was considered. Ahmedi, J (as his Lordship then was) in considering secularism as one of the basic structures of the Constitution observed at para — 28: <br> “28.Notwithstanding the fact that the  words ‘Socialist’, and ‘Secular’ were added in the Preamble of the Constitution in 1976 by the 42nd Amendment, the concept of Secularism was very much embedded in our Constitutional philosophy....-- By this amendment what was implicit Was made explicit. The Preamble itself  spoke of liberty of thought, expression. belief, faith and worship. While granting this_liberty the Preamble promised_equality of status and opportunity. It also spoke of promoting fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation. While granting to its citizens liberty of belief, faith and worship, the Constitution abhorred discrim- ination on grounds of religion etc., but permit- ted special treatment for Scheduled Castes and Tribes, vide Articles 15 and 16 . Art. 25 next provided, subject to public order, morality and  health, that all persons shall be entitled to free-  dom of conscience and the right to profess, practice  and propagate religion, Art. 26  State’s revenue cannot be utilized for the promotion and maintenace  of any religion or religious group- that_secularism is a basic feature_of our                Constitution.......... \" (Page-1951.52)   ",
      "356. The case of Subhesh Sharma vs Union of India AIR 1991 SC 631, is in the nature of a public interest litigation, praying for filling up of the vacancies of Judges in the Supreme Court of India and also several other High Courts there. In consid- ering the basic structure doctrine, the Supreme  Court held at para -44: <br> “44.Judicial Review is a part of the basic  constitutional structure and one of the basic fea- tures of the essential Indian Constitutional pol-                icy, This essential constitutional doctrine does not by itself justify or necessitate any primacy to the executive wing on the ground of its polit- ical accountability to the electorate. On the con- trary what is necessary is an interpretation sus- taining the strength and vitality of Judicial  review........\" (Page = 646).                     ",
      "355. In declaring the amendment of Article- 100 and Article-107 of the Constiitution as unconsti- tutional, his Lordship reminded the duties of the cit-  izens at para — 488: <br> “488............... The future_of the  Constitution lies in the commitment of the citi- zens who _are obliged under article 21 of the Constitution to_observe the Constitution.”  (Page- 181).  ",
      "354. In considering the rule of la in the Preamble of the Constitution, his Lordship  observed at para — 443: <br> «443.In this case we ar€ concerned with only one basic feature, the rule of law, marked out as one of the fundamental aims of our soci- ety in the Preamble. ... .\"(Page-171)  ",
      "353. MH Rahman, J (as his Lordship then  was), in considering the basic structure doctrine observed at para — 438: <br> 435 . The doctrine of basic structure is one growing point in the constitutional jurispru-  dence, it has developed in a climate where the executive, commanding an overwhelming majority in the legislature, gets snap amend- ments of the Constitution passed without a Green Paper  or White Paper, without eliciting any public opinion without sending the Bill to any select committee and without sufficeint time to the members of the Parliament for deliberation on the bill for amendment                  ",
      "352. In appreciating the argument that the amendment destroyed a basic structure of the Constitution his Lordship held the amendment void at para - 377 -378: <br> “377 . Main objection to the doctrine of basic structure is that it is uncertain in nature and is based on unfounded fear.  . If by exercising the amending power people’s sovereignty is sought to be curtailed it  is the constitutional duty of the Court to restrain it and in that case it will be improper to accuse the Court of acting as “super-legislators”™.    ",
      "351. On consideration of the amended Article along with other provisions of the Constitution, his Lordship found the amended provision inconsistent with other provisions of the Constitution at para-373.  ",
      "350. In recognizing the concept of the basic structure of the Constitution, his Lordship observed at para - 34°: <br> “341 There is, however, a substantial dif- ference between Constitution and its amend- ment. Before the amendment becomes a part of the Constitution it shall have to pass through some test, because it is not enacted by the peo-  ple through a Constituent Assembly.   ",
      "349. Shahabuddin Ahmed, J, (as his Lordship then was) explained the word ‘amendment’ of the Constitution at para -336:  336..............;  the word ‘amendment’ or ‘amend’ has been used in different places to mean different things; so it is the context by referring to which the actual meaning of the word ‘amendment’ can be ascertained. My con- clusion, therefore, is that the word “a;n_ejﬂ: ment” is a change or alteration, for the purpose of bringing in_improvement in the statute (o  make it more effective_and meaningful, but it does not mean_its abrogation destruction or a                change resulting in the loss of its original iden-  tity and character. In the case of amendment of a constitutional provision “amendment” should be that which accords with the intention of the makers of the Constitution.” (Page-141).  ",
      "347. His Lordship found that the amended artcle — 100 is ultra vires because it was inconsis- tent with the various provisions of the Constitution in disregard of Article 7 which forbids such a law. In accepting the contentions in this regard his Lordship  observed at para 198 — 199: «198.Mr Syed Ishtiaq Ahmad reinforced  the argument by his inimitable way of expound-  ing the Constitution pointing to ‘its grace and  beauty and termed it as an unique constitution  because Article 7 is not to be found in any other Constitution standing like statue of liberty.  arti  199 . Mr Asrarul Hossain and Mr Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed pointed out that Article 7 was never amended, no attempt was made because such exercise would be in futility constitutionally. (Page-97)  ",
      "345. With regard to the amending power of the parliament, Badrul Haider Chowdhury, J (as his Lordship then was), held at para — 165-166: <br> 165.The Attorney-General argued that the amending power is a constituent power. It is not a legislative power and therefore, the Parliament has unlimited power to amend the Constitution invoking its constituent power.  166.The argument is untenable. The Attorney-General argued this point keeping an eye on Article 368 of the Constitution of India which says that “Parliament may in exercise of its constituent power amend” etc. which was inserted by amendment following certain obser- vations in the Golak Nath case. The amendment therefore recognised the distinction between an ordinary law and 2 constitutional amendment. It will not be proper to express any opinion as to the merit of any constitutional amendment made in Constitution of another country. It will be enough that our Constitution does not make  such distinction. Secondly, our Constitution is not only a controlled one but the limitation on legislative capacity of the Parliament is  enshrined in such a way that a removal of any plank will bring down the structure itself , For  this reason, the Preamble, Article 8, had been  made unamendable—it has to be referred to the  people! At once Article 7 stares on the face to say: “All power in the Republic_belongs to the people , and more, \"their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under and by the authority of this Constitution\" To dispel any doubt it says: \"This Constitution is as the solemn expression of the will of the people\" The  Preamble says ‘it is our sacred duty t0 safe-  guard, protect, and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh”.  If Article 26 and Article 7  are read together the position will be clear. The exclusiduary provision of the kind incorporated in Article 26 by amendment has not been incor- porated in Article 7 . That shows that the ‘law’  in Article 7 is conclusively intended to include an_amending law. An amending law becomes part of the Constitution but an amending law cannot_be valid if it is inconsistent with the Constitution, The contention of the Attorney- General on the non-obstante clause in Article  142 is bereft of any substance ‘because that clause merely confers enabling power for  amendment but by interpretative decision that clause cannot be given the status for swallow-  ing_up_the constitutional fabric. It may be noticed that unlike 1956 Constitution or Sree  Lanka Constitution there is no provision in our Constitution for replacing the Constitution.”                 ",
      "344. Martial Law was proclaimed for the sec- ond time in Bangladesh on March 24, 1982, by Lieutenant General HM Ershad NDC psc, the Chief of Army Staff of Bangladesh. By this proclamation he assumed unlimited, supreme and absolute power in the Government of Bangladesh, in the garb of Chief Martial Law Administrator, for governing this country by anything but the Constitution (Para-274 of the 8th Amendment case). Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh was suspended and the Country was ruled by Martial Law Proclamations, Orders and Regulations. By the Martial Law Order No. 11 of 1982, four permanent Benches of the High Court was set-up in various places in the country including one at Dhaka. The Constitution, however, was restored on November 10, 1986 . On June 9, 1988 Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Act, 1988, was passed, amending Article-100 of the Constitution, among others, set- ting up six permanent Benches in difterent district Head-Quarters of the country. The constitutionality of such amendment of Article-100 was challenged on the ground inter alia that the said amendment  was beyond the amending power of the Parliament                 under Article 142 of the Constitution and that by this amendment a basic structure of the Constitution was destroyed. The High Court Division rejected the pciilions summarily. The appeals were allowed by (he majority of 3 to 1 in the Appellate Division.  ",
      "343. Next we shall discuss the decision in the case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD (Spl) 1 . This case is also known as the Constitution 8th Amendment case. This is a histori- cal Judgment of our Apex Court and we intend to  deal with it rather elaborately.  ",
      "340. Chandrachud, CJ, on behalf of the major- ity observed at para-22 about the limited power of amendment of the Constitution: <br>               “22.Since the Constitution had conferred a limited amending power on the Parliament, the  Parliament_cannot_under_the_exercise_of_that limited power enlarge that very power into_an absolute_power, Indeed, a limited amending  power is one of the features of our Constitution and therefore, the limitations on that power can- not be destroyed. In other words, Parliament  cannot, under Article 368, expand its amending power so as to aquire for itself the right to repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to destroy its basic and_essential features, The donee of a limited power cannot by the exercise of that power convert the limited power into an unlimited one.”   ",
      "339. Clause 4 of Section 55 deprive the Courts of their power to call in question any amendment of the Constitution while clause 5 confers upon the Parliament a vast and undefined power to amend the Constitution.  ",
      "338. Section 4 amended Article 31C of the Constitution to the extent that no law giving eflect to the policy of the State would be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with any of the rights under Articles 14, 19 or 31.  ",
      "337. The next important case we shall consid- er is Minerva Mills Ltd vs Union of India AIR 1980) SC 1789 . The company and its share-holders, the petitioners in this case, challenged the constitution- al validity of certain provisions of the Sick Textile Undertaking (Nationalisation) Act, 1974 and the Order of the Government authorizing taking over of the management of Minerva Mills Ltd. The consti- tutional validity of Sections 4 and 55 of the Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act, 1976, was also challenged and the Supreme Court, in this case, considered the said constitutional issue.  ",
      "334. Kesavanana Bharati'’s case was followed and explained in the case of Smt. Indira Nehru                Gandhi vs Shri Raj Narayan AIR 1975 SC 2299, In that case, the legality of clause 4 of Article 329-A was challenged. The Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975, inserted the said Article, One of the purposes of the amendment was to con- fer validity on the election of Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi to the Lok Sabha in 1971, The question was whether the provisions of clause 4 of Article 329 by which the constituent authority in eflect prescribed that no election law was to govern the challenge to the election of the appellant, or whether it is void on the ground that it effects the basic structure of the  Constitution.   ",
      "333. All the seven Judges, however, who con- stituted the majority in Kesavananda Bharati, agreed that democratic set-up is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India.  ",
      "332. The summary of the views signed by nine out of thirteen learned Judges are amongst others: <br> “1.Golak Nath's case is overruled. <br> 2.Article 368 does not enable parliament to alter the basic structure or frame-work of the Constitution,  ",
      "331. In considering the purpose of amend- ment of the Constitution and the implied limitation upon such power his Lordships held at para — 681:  «681.There is a further fallacy in the con- tention that whenever Constitution is amended.  we should presume that the amendment in ques- tion was made in order to adopt the Constitution to  respond to the growing needs of the peo- ple...... A power which is capable of being used against the people themselves cannot be considered as a power exercised on behalf of the people or in their interest.”. <br> ( The underlinings are mine)  ",
      "330. In perceiving the dreams of the founding fathers in achieving independence and enacting a modern Constitution for India with lofty ideals in a broad and prismatic perspective, Hedge and Muykherjee, JJ, themselves carried away with their deep sense of concomitant to their nation-hood at para — 664: <br> “664 . From the preamble it is quite clear that the two primary objectives that were befors the Constituent Assembly were (1) to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic and (2) to secure to its citizens the rights men- tioned therein. Our founding fathers, at any rate, most of them had made immense sacrifices for the sake of securing those objectives.   Their constitutional plan was to build a welfare state and an egalitarian society.”  ",
      "329. Although many of the matters with regard to the amendments curtailing the fundamen- tal rights to property had already been judicially set- tled but it is still justiciable if the basic structure of the Constitution is dented,  ",
      "328. To summarise, his Lordship, Sikri, CJ, held at para — 492: <br> “492, To summarise, I hold that: <br> (a) Golak Nath's case, (1967) 2 SCR 762 = (AIR 1967 SC 1643), declared that a Consti- tutional amendment would be bad if it infringed Article 13 (2), as this applied not only to ordi-  nary legislation but also to an amendment of the Constitution. <br> (b) Golak Nath's case, (1967) 2 SCR 762 = (AIR 1967 SC 1643). Did not decide whether Article 13 (2) can be amended under Article 368 or determine the exact meaning of the expression “amendment of this Constitution™ in Article 368. <br>   (d) The Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1971, as interpreted by me, has been validly enacted. <br> (e) Article 368 does not enable Parliament in its constituent capacity to delegate its func- tion of amending the Constitution to another legislature or to itself in its ordinary legislative capacity. <br> (f) Section 2 of the Constitution (Twenty- fifth Amendment) Act, 1971, as interpreted by me, is valid. <br> (g) Section 3 of the Constitution (Twenty- fifth Amendment) Act, 1971 is void as it dele- gates power to legislatures to amend the Constitution. <br> (h) The Constitution (Twenty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1971 is ineffective to protect the impugned Acts if they abrogate or take away fundamental rights. The constitution Bench will decide whether the impugned Acts take away fundamental rights or only abridge them, and in the latter case whether they effect reasonable abridgments in the public interest.” (The underlinings are mine)  Regarding amendments vis-a-vis the basic structure of the Constitution, Shelat and Grover,                 jj held in Kishavananda in para < 599-.600:  _\"599% The basic structure_of the Constitution_is_not_a_vague_coneept_and the apprehensions expressed on behalf of the respondents that neither the citizen nor the Parliament would be able to understand it are unfounded. If the historical background , the the relevant provisions thereof, including Article 368 are kept in mind there can be no dif- ficulty in discerning that the following can be regarded as the basic elements of the constitution structure, (These cannot be catalogued but can only be illustrated). <br> 1 . The supremacy of the Constitution. <br> 2 . Republican and Democratic form of Government and sovereignty of the country. <br> 3 Secular and federal character of the Constitution. <br> 4 . Demarcation of power between the leg- islature, the executive and the judiciary. <br> 5 . The dignity of the individual secured by the Various freedoms and basic rights in Part III and the mandate to build a wel- fare State contained in Part IV. <br> 6 . The unity and the integrity of the nation.”  ",
      "327. In considering whether the 24th Amendment enlarged the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, his Lordship held at para - 408 and 410: <br> “408.It seems to me that it is not legitimate to interpret Article 368 in this manner. Clause (e) of the proviso does not give any different power than what is contained in the main arti- cle. The meaning of the expression “Amend- ment of the Constitution” does not change when one reads the proviso. If the meaning is the same, Article 368 can only be amended so as not to change its identity completely. Parliament, for instance, could not make the Constitution uncontrolled by changing the pre- scribed two thirds majority to simple majority. Similarly it cannot get rid of the true meaning of the expression “Amendment of the Constitution™ so as to derive power to abrogate fundamental rights.” <br> “410....... . Under__Article 368 Parliament can amend every article of the Constitution as long as the result is within the  imits already laid down by me. The amend- ment of Article 13(2) does not go beyond the limits laid down because Parliament cannot even after the amendment abrogate or authorize abrogation or the taking away of fundament rights. After the amendment now a law which  has the effect of merely abridging a right while  remaining_within the limits laid down would not be liable to be struck down.”  ",
      "326. In conclusion, his Lordship regarded the First and Fourth Amendment as made within the amending power of the Parliament,  ",
      "325. In response to the argument in respect of waiver of rights, on the basis of an observation by SK Das, J. in Basheshar Nath vs CIT AIR 1959 SC 149, the Hon'ble Chief Justice, held at para — 312: <br> «312.T must point out that the learned Judge was expressing the minority opinion that there could be a waiver of fundamental rights in certain circumstances. Das, CJ, and Kapur, J, held that there could be no waiver of funda- mental rights founded on Article 14 of the Constitution, while Bhagwati and Subba Rao, JJ held that there could be no waiver not only of fundamental rights enshrined in Article 14 but also of any other fundamental rights guaranteed  by Part 11 of the Constitution.”                ",
      "324. In repelling the Hon’ble Chief  Seerevai, Advocate General, Justice held at para — 308: <br> «308.He also relied on the words “rights  conferred” in Article 13(2) and “enforcement of  any rights conferred by this Part” to show that  they were not natural or inalienable and could  not have been claimed by them. There is no question of the sovereign people claiming them from an_outside agency. The people acting through the Constituent Assembly desired that the rights mentioned in Part 111 shall be guaran- teed and, therefore, Part 11T was enacted. In the context ‘conferred’ does not mean that_some superior power had granted these rights. It 1s very much like a King bestowing the title of “His Imperial Majesty’ on himself.”  ",
      "323. In this connection it should be remem- bered that the country belongs to the people as a                           whole and not to the members of Parliament or 1o any other body of persons. They are voted to the parliament to represent the people as their trusted agent. The members of parliament are the trustees for and on behalf of the people of Bangladesh as a whole. As such, all the rights belong to the people, although in order to protect their interest, their rights are sometimes required to be adjusted or even cur- tailed but within the ambit of the Constitution itself.  kecping in view their inalienable rights.  the contention of Mr  ",
      "303. The _above structure is built on the basic foundation i.e. the dignity of supreme importance.  of the individual. This is of supreme impor- This cannot by any form of amendment be destroyed.  304.The above foundation and the above basic features are easily discernible_not only from the preamble but the whole scheme of the Constitution, which I have already discussed.”  ",
      "322. Regarding the basic feature of the Cons-  titution. his Lordship held as follows:  «302.The learned Attorney-General said that every provision of the Constitution is essential: otherwise it would not have been put in the Constitution. This is true. But this does not place every provision of the Constitution in the same position. The true position is that everv provision of the Constitution can _be amended provided in the result the basic foun- dation and structure of the constitution remains  the same. The basic structurc may be said to consist of the following features; <br> (1) Supremacy of the Constitution; <br> (2) Republican and Democratic forms of Government. ‘ <br> (3) Secular character of the Constitution; <br> (4) Separation of powers between the legis- lature, the executive and the judiciary; <br> (5) Federal character of the Constitution.  ",
      "321. On consideration of different provisions of the Constitution, Sikri, CJ, explained an amend  ment of the Constitution in this tnanner 24 gz 791 - 294 and para- 297-299. <br> “291, What is the necessary implication from all the provisions of the Constitution/?  reading fie  292 . It seems to me that the reading the preamble , the fundamental importance of the freedom of the individual, indeed its inalienability and the importance of the economic, social and political justice mentioned in the preamble the importance of directive principles,  the non-inclusion in Article 362 of provi- sions like Arts,52, 53 and various other provi- snons to vhich rcfercncc has already  been made an irresistable conclusion emerges that it was not the intention to use the word \"amendment\" in the widest sense,  293 . It was the common understanding that fundamental rights would remain in substance as they are and they would not be amended out of existence. It seems also to have been a com- mon understanding that the fundamental <b> fea- tures of the Constitution, manely, secularism, democracy and the freedom of the individual would always subsist in the welfare state. </b>  294 . In view of the above reasons, a neces- sary implication arises the power of Parliament  that the expression “amendment of this Consti- tution\" has consequently a limited meaning in  our Constitution and not the meaning suggested  by the respondents.  297 . For the aforesaid reasons, I am driven  to the conclusion that the expression “amend- ment of this  Constitution\" in Art, 368 means any addition or change in any of the provisions of the Constitution within the broad contours of  the preamble and the Constitution to carry out the objectives in the Preamble and the Directive Principles. Applied to fundamental rights, it would mean that while fundamental rights can- not be abrogated reasonable abridgments of fundamental rights can be effected in the public  interest.                           298, It is of course for Parliament to decide whether an amendment is necessary. The Courts will not be concerned with the wisdom of the amendment.  200, If this meaning is given it would enable Parliament to adjust fundamental rights in order to secure what the Directive Principles direct to be accomplished, while maintaining the freedom and dignity of every citizen.”  ",
      "320. The rigid formulation in Golak Nath’s  case that all fundamental rights are non-amendable by the Parliament, was modified in the Kesavananda Bharati's case. It was decided in the said case by a majority of 9-4 that the basic features of the Constitution cannot be destroyed or changed by the process of amendment, rather, those ideals and values of the Constitution should be preserved. The approach in the Kesavananda’s case was flexi- ble. It was decided therein that whether the relevant fundamental right constitutes a ‘basic feature’ or not remains with the Court to decide finally on the facts and circumstances of each case. It should be noted that even in this case it was held that the fundamen- tal right to property is not a basic feature of the Constitution and thereby over-ruled the decision in the Golak Nath's case.  ",
      "319. In this case, the validity of Twenty- fourth, Twenty-fifth and Twenty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution of India, further denting the already truncated fundamental right to property, was under challenge. Besides, the correctness of the decision in Golak Nath’s case was also decided. However, in deciding these above noted questions, the real issue before the Supreme Court was the extent of the amending power, conferred by Article 368 of the Constitution apart form Article 13(2), on the Parliament.  ",
      "318. Next we shall consider the decision of the gupreme Court of India in the case of Kesavananda Bharati etc. vs State of Kerala etc, AIR 1973 SC 1461 . This is a historical and land-mark Judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of India. Since we agree and rely on the principles stated in this deci-  sion, we shall refer to it some what elaborately.  ",
      "317. In over-ruling the earlier decisions in Shankari Prasad’s and Sajjan Singh’s case, the majority of the Court reached the following conclu-  sion at para = 53: <br> \"(53) The aforesaid discussion leads to the  following results: <br> (1) The power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution is derived from Arts. 254, 246 and 248 of the Constitution and not from Art. 368 thereof, which only deals with procedure. Amendment is a legislative process. <br> (2) Amendment is ‘law’ within the mean- ing of Art. 13 of the Constitution and, therefore, if it takes away or abridges the rights conferred by part 111 thereof, it is void. <br> (3) The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, and the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, abridge the scope of the fundamental rights. But, on the basis of ear- lier decisions of this Court, they were valid. <br> (4) On the application of the doctrine of ‘prospective overruling’, as explained by us earlier, our decision will have only prospective operation and, therefore, the said amendments will continue to be valid. <br> (5) We declare that the Parliament wij] have no power from the date of this decision to amend any of the provisions of part I of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights enshrined therein. <br> (6) As the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act holds the field, the validity of                the two impugned Acts, namely, The Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act X of 1953, and the Mysore Land Reforms Act X of 1962, as amended by Act X1V of 1965, cannot be ques- tioned on the ground that they offend Arts, 13, 14 or 31 of the Constitution,”  ",
      "316. It may be recalled that in Shankari Prasad’s case (AIR 1951 SC 456), the First Amend- ment to the Constitution of India curtailing the fun- damental right to property by inserting Article 31 A and 31 B was held to be valid. This decision was  _assumed to be correct in a number of subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of India. But in  Sajjan Singh's case (AR 1965 SC §45), two of the learned Judges inclined to take a different view. The conflict between the majority and the minority views was resolved in Golak Noth's case by consti- wuting a larger Bench of 11 (eleven) learned Judges. Subba Rao, CJ, on behalf of himself and four other judges gave the leading Judgment, supported by another Judgment, separately given by Hidayatulla,  J.  ",
      "315. The Seventeenth Amendment was enact- ed in 1964, widening further the ambit of Article 31A, included by the first Amendment. It provided among others the inclusion of ‘ryotwari’ tenure within the definition of ‘estate’, as such, any legis- lation in respect of such ryotwari tenure became immune from challenge on the ground of violation  of fundamental right to property. Besides, the said amendment added a further forty four new statutes passed by the various states to schedule IX to the Constitution, making those immune from challenge. With this amendment, the total number of immu- nized statutes rose to sixty-four.  ",
      "314. In the case of Golak Nath vs State of Punjab AIR 1967 SC 1643, constitutionality of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution was under challenge.  ",
      "313. It would appear that in Sajjan Singh’s case Hidayatullah, J, propounded the theory of non- amenability of fundamental rights while Mudholkar, J expressed his views, although with caution, that the basic features of the Constitution are not amend- able.  ",
      "312. In the case of Sajjan Singh vs State of Rajasthan AIR 1965 SC 845, the validity of Constitution (seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, was under challenge. The said amendment again seriously affected the fundamental right to property. The majority of the Supreme Court, in following the decision in Shankeri Prasad, upheld the validity of the said Amendment Act, 1964 . But the minority of the judges expressed their doubts about the correct- ness of the decision in Shankari Prasad’s Case. His Lordship further held at para-62.  (62). It has been said, no doubt, that the preamble is not a part of our Constitution. But, I think, that if upon a comparison of the pream- ble with the broad features of the Constitution it                would appear that the preamble is an epitome of those features or, to_put it differently_of these features are_an_amplification_or concretisation of the concepts set out in the premble, it may have to be considered whether the preamble is not a part of the Constitution. While consider- ing this question it would be of relevance to  >  bear in mind that the preamble is not of the common run such as is to be found in an Act of a legislature, It has the stamp of deep deliberation has it marked by precision. Would this not suggest that the farmers of the Constitution attached special significance to it?  ",
      "311. These observations of the Pakistan Supreme Court were upheld in the minority judg- ment of Mudholkar, J. in the case of Sajjan Singh vs State of Rajasthan AIR 1965 SC 845 at para — 59, page- 864.  ",
      "310. In highlighting the main feature of the Constitution, his Lordship further held at page - 538: <br> “The main feature of the Constitution, therefore, is that a Minister should not be a member of the House, he should have no right to vote therein, nor should his tenure of office be dependent upon the support of the majority of the members of the Assembly nor should he be responsible to the Assembly. This is an essential characteristic of a Presidential form of Government and Mr Brohi appearing on behalf of the respondent has called it the “main fabric”  t of government sought to be set u by the present Constitution. An alternation of this “main fabric”, therefore, so as to destroy it altogether cannot, in my view, be called an adaptation of the Constitution for purpose of  implementing it.”  ",
      "309. Approving Cooley in this respect, Hamoodur Rahman, J, (as his Lordship then was) observed at page — 535: <br> “A Constitution”, says Cooley in his Treatise on Constitutional Limitations is “the fundamental law of a State, containing the prin- ciples upon which the Government is founded, regulating the division of the sovereign powers, and directing to what persons each of these powers is to be confined, and the manner in which it is to be exercised.” The fundamental principle underlying a written Constitution is that it not only specifies the persons or authori- ties in whom the sovereign powers of the State are to be vested but also lays down fundamen- tal rules for the selection or appointment of such persons or authorities and above all fixes the limits of the exercise of those powers, Thu:  written Constitution i :_source fro which all governmental power emanates and i defines its scope and ambit so that each func ionarv should act within his respective sphere  No power can, therefore, be claimed by any   functionary which_is not to be found within (he  four corners of the Constitution nor can anyone transgress the limits therein specified,”  ",
      "308. In the same case, Fazle Akbar, J,  observed at page - 523:  In any event it is clear from Part-X1 of the Constitution that no power_has been bestowed               on the Preseident to amend the Constitutionat his own will,” His Lordship further held at page — 524: <br> “From the language of the Atticle it is abundantly clear that this_Article was never meant to bestow power on the President to change the fundamentals of the Constitution, Our Constitution has provided for a Presidential form of government and the President by the impugned Order has introduced a semi-Parlia- mentary form of Government. As already stat-  ed, this Article 224(3) was never meant to  bestow _power on the President to change the fundamental of the  Constitution. However  wholesome the intention and however noble the motive may_be the extra-constitutional action  could not be supported because the President  was not entitled to get beyond the Constitution and touch any of the fundamentals of the Constitution.”  ",
      "307. In dismissing the appeal before the  Supreme Court, PLD 1963 SC 486, Cornelius, CJ, emphatically ordained as far back as in 1963 at page  -512: <br> “The impression is clear and unavoidable that the ground of expediency was based on a desire to accede to the wishes of certain per- sons, probably a fairly small number of persons, but the Constitution was not intended to be varied according to the wishes of any person or persons.\"  unless provided by the Constitution itself, would be a violation of the  Constitution, and if the Constitution were itself altered for some such reason, and that in a sub-  stantial, and not_merely a machinery_aspect there would clearly be an erosion, a whittling  away of its provisions, which it would be the duty  of the superior Courts to resist in defence of the Constitution . The aspect of the franchise, and of the form of Government are fundamental features of a Constitution and to alter them, in limine in order to placate or secure the support of a few persons, would appear to be equivalent not to bringing the given Constitution into force, but to bringing into_effect an altered or different Constitution..”  ",
      "306. Under such circumstances, in declaring the impugned Order 34 of 1962 wltra vires to the  Constitution being in excess of the powers of the President Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Murshed, J. held at para - 78: <br> “78 . The text of Article 224 (3) is very clear  and unambiguous. It does not permit alterations of the provisions of the Constitution for a solution of a olitical situation brought about by some members of the National assembly who  refused to accept appointments as Ministers, if such appointments entailed cessation of their  membership of the Assembly.”  ",
      "305. In the above noted case, Fazlul Quader Chowdhury, Khan A Sabur Khan and Wahiduz- zaman were elected as the members of the National Assembly of Pakistan. Shortly thereafter, they were also appointed to the President’s Council of Ministers in pursuance of an Order passed by the President, pur- ported to have been passed under Article 224 (3) of the Constitution, in order to remove the difficulty in the formation of the Council of Ministers. Such appointment, their membership in the National  assembly was challenged in this case. In considering the process of amendment of the Constitution in gen- eral, Murshed, J. held at para- 53: <br> “53.......A Constitution is a solemn and sacred document of seminal and supreme con- sequence, partaking the nature of almost scrip- tura sanctity, embodying, as it usually does, the  final will and testament of the sovereign authority- that resides in the people and providing the manner and norms of the Government of a nation. It therefore, assumes something of the immutability of the laws of the Medes and the  Persians. It is not subject to easy change which is usually effected by a special and somewhat difficult process. In the present Constitution the provisions with regard to \"amendment\" of the Constitution have been enumerated in Articles 208 to 210 . We may note that it requires a two- thirds majority of the Legislature to effect an amendment in the Constitution.\"    ",
      "303. Murshed, J in the case or Md Abdul  Haque vs Fazlul Quader Chowdhury PLD 1963  Dhaka 669 = 15 DLR 355, tead the above dictum in this perspective at page — 698 M:  “The aforesaid dictum of the Supreme  Court of Pakistan is a pointer that in the case  before us the power of “adaptation” does not  xtend wiping out of a vital provision of  the Constitution to implement a decision of the members of the Assembly who were invited to  be Ministers.”                  ",
      "302. The First Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had been passed by the Constituent Assembly on the February 29, 1956 and assent to it was given by the Governor General on March 2, 1956 . It came into force on March 23, 1956 and Pakistan ceased to be a Dominion and became a Republic on and from that date. The President of Pakistan made reference under Article 162 of the Constitution to the Supreme Court for its opinion as to whether the Governor of a Province was empowered to dissolve the Provincial Assembly. Munir, CJ., in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court [PLD 1957 SC 219 = 9 DLR (SC) 178] observed at para — 33 (DLR): <br> [......., The Constitution defines the qualifications which a candidate for election to the Provincial Assembly, or a voter in a con- stituency for such Assembly, must possess: but Mr Manzur Qadir would give to the President  under Article 234 the power to destroy, though for a temporary period, the very basis of the new Constitution by claiming for him the power to_form the constituencies and to order the preparation of electoral rolls in direct violation  of the Constitution merely to im lement_the  \"  ecision ioverno  ",
      "301. It appears that the Supreme Court of India in Shankari Prasad’s case, adopted a literal interpretation of the Constitution of India and held that Article 13 envisages legislative law made by a legislature but not 1o a constituent law, made to mend the Constitution. The Court rejected the argument that the fundamental rights including the  right to property are sacrosanct and are not amend- able in the normal process under Article 368 of the Constitution. The whole decision, it appears, hinged upon an assumption that the expression ‘law’ in Article 13 (2) does not include constitutional law.  ",
      "300. The facts leading to the Shankari Prasad’s case were that immediately after independence, the Parliament in India carried out agrarian reforms by enacting various laws. This resulted in the abolition of Zemindaries in various States in India. Those Acts were challenged on the ground that the funda- mental rights as stated in Part 111 of the Constitution were contravened. The Union Government, in order to put an end to these litigations and also to push ahead with its agrarian reforms in aid of The millions of landless peasants, without loosing further time, passed the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 . The Supreme Court of India upheld the said  amendment of the Constitution.  ",
      "298. India adopted its Constitution in 1950 while Pakistan its first in 1956.  299, In India the First Amendment of the Constitution was made within one year of inaugura- tion of its Constitution in 1951 being the Constitu- tion (First Amendment) Act, 1951 . This amendment added two new provisions to the Constitution, namely, Article 31A and Article 31B along with the Schedule IX. These new provisions curtailed the right to property guaranteed by Article 31 . This amendment of the Constitution was challenged in the case of Shankari Prasad Singh Deo vs Union of India AIR 1951 SC 438.  ",
      "297. This Indian sub-continent gained its inde- pmdcncc by the Indian Independence Act, 1947. This Act brought into existence (wo new pominions, namely, India and Pakistan. Section 8 of the Act empowers the Constituent Assemblies of each country to frame its own Constitution.  ",
      "296. Now we shall pass on to examine the constitutional position of this sub-continent.  ",
      "295. It will also be perceived that in none of the 27 (twenty seven) amendments, the original or the basic character of the Constitution of 1787 were varied or detoured in any manner, rather, the amend- ments were all made glorifying the basic ideals embodied in the original National Constitution for which their fore-fathers fought and won a Republic for the future generations, Since none of the amend- ments violated the basic features of the original Constitution, the US Supreme Court had no occa-  sion to hold otherwise.                ",
      "294. From the above discussion it would - appear that the Constitution of the United States is a rigid one. It is the supreme law and all great Institutions of the Republic owe its existence to the Constitution. The Constitution itself provides for its amendment but the procedure is difficult and cir- cuitous but was so made in order to reflect the will of the people. Their sentiment and voice is accepted as paramount and supreme. All 27 (twenty seven) amendments were made bonafide in the interest of the Republic, the beneficiary is the people alone. None of the amendments were made for personal aggrandizement or in order to hide the illegal acts of any usurper. The amendments of the United States, unlike the Constitution (Fifth Amendment), Act. 1979 of Bangladesh, were made not only as steps towards further refinements of the original Constitution but also to highlight the harmonions picture of the entire Constitution together with its amendments. '  ",
      "293. On the question as to Constitution as lim- itation of power, American Jurisprudence, 2nd Vol. 16 states as follows: <br> “The Constitution of the United States and  any amendments thereto, together with federal laws made in pursuance thereof, and treatise made under the authority of the United States, are expressly declared to be the supreme law of the land in the Constitution itself. The constitu- tion_as the supreme law is without qualification and is absolute, While the national government is one of limited powers, those actually granted constitute the paramount authority of the land.  The Federal Constitution is binding on all offi- cers and departments h_the federal and state_Governments, including _every court  whether it derives its authority from a state or  from the United States.” (Para-51, Page-408-9).  ",
      "292. Article V of the Constitution invests the Congress with enormous power to propose almost any amendment to the Constitution except that no State can be denied of equal representation in the Senate without its consent. From time to time, vires of the amendments were challenged before the Supreme Court, for example, Nineteenth Amend- ment extending suffrage to women was challenged in Lesser vs Palmer (1920) but those attempts  proved futile.  ",
      "291. Amendments are part of the normal con- stitutional process in the United States and each amendment enriched its Constitution to some extent. Each of the twenty seven amendments con- tributed to the democratisation of the Republic and thereby highlighted the sovereignty of the people, by and for whom the Republic was brought into existence. In other words the amendment of the Constitution of the United States were meant to fur- ther grace the Republic, and enhance its prestige by achieving refinements of the Constitution but never meant for impoverish it by legalizing heinous sedi- tious acts against the Republic and its Constitution as happened more than once in Bangladesh.  ",
      "290. A reading of the amendments would unmistakably show that the first ten amendments                were made to protect the fundamental and basic human rights of the citizens of the United States. The next seventeen amendments were made during the last two hundred years of the Republic. Those amendments were made for the enhancement of the interest of the people of the United States and in general, of the Republic. During the last two hun- dred years the Republic of the United States went through a Civil war and many a crisis and in the most turbulent times, they did never disown or dis- honour their Constitution, rather, the supremacy of the Constitution was proved time and again, more so  during their national crisis.  ",
      "289. Inre Duncan (1891), 139 US 449 . 461 = 35 L. Ed. 219, Chief Justice Fuller held:  e distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of the legisla- tive power reposed in representative bodies,  whose legitimate acts maybe said to be those of  the people themselves; but while the people are thus the source of political power, their governments, National and state, have been limited by written Constitutions, and they have themselves there by set bounds to their own power, as against the sudden impulses of mere majorities\" <br>  [Quoted from cases on Constitutional Law by Professor Noel T Dowling, Fifth  Edition, Page-151 (notes)]  ",
      "288. In Ullman vs United States (1956). 350) US 422 =100L Ed 511, it was held that nothing new  can be put into the Federal Constitution except  through the amendatory process, and nothing old can be taken out without the same process (Quoted from American Jurisprudence 2d Vol. 16, page —358 n. 26).  ",
      "287. The next seventeen amendments were made during the last two hundred years, the last twenty-seventh amendment was ratified on May 7, 1992.  ",
      "286. In the case of Dorr vs United States (1904) 195 US 138 = 49 L. ED. 128, Justice Day held:  ............ <br> In every case where Congress undertales to legislate in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution, the Question may arise as to how far the exercise of the power is limited by the \"prohibitions\" of  that_instrument........ \"(Quoted from Cases on  Constitutional Law by Professor Noel. T. Dowling, Fifth Edition, 1954, page — 399- 400).”  ",
      "285. In the case of Dred Scott vs Sandford (1857), Justice Curtis held: <br> “If, then, this clause does contain a power to legislate respecting the territory, what are limits of that power? <br> “To this I answer that, in common with all the other legislative powers of Congress, it finds limits in the express prohibitions on Con-  gress not to do certain things; that, in the exer-  cise of the legislative power, Congress cannot pass an ex post facto law or bill of attainder; and so in respect to each of the other prohibi  tions contained in_the Constitution.” (Quoted from cases on Constitutional Law By Professor Noel T Dowling, Fifth Edition, 1954, page - 399)    ",
      "284. In Mormon Church vs United States (1890) 136 US 1, it was held by the Supreme Court by way of dicta: <br> “Doubtless Congress legislating for the ter- ritories would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the Constitution and its Amendments; but these limitations would exist  rather by inference an general spirit of the Constitution from which Congress derives all its powers, then by any express and direct application of its provisions.”  ",
      "283. The first ten amendments were proposed in 1789 and were ratified in December 15, 1791 and together form what is known as the Bill of Rights of the National Constitution. However, it is for the Supreme Court to say what rights are fundamental  in this sense.  ",
      "282. It may be recalled that the Federal Constitution was ratified by the thirteen States on September 17, 1987 and became operative in 1789. At that time it was assured that amendments guar- anteeing individual rights would be made forthwith, as such, the first Congress assembled under the Constitution, proposed a series of amendments to the State Legislatures in 1789.  ",
      "281. Article V provides for amendment of the   Federal Constitution, The process of amendment ts   both difficult and circuitous. It is effected by pro-   posal and ratification, An Amendment may be pro-   posed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of   Congress or by a national constitutional convention   called by Congress upon request of the Legislatures   of two-thirds of the States, The proposed amend-   ments must be ratified by the Legislatures of three-   fourths of the states or by special conventions in   three-fourths of the states, These stringent proce-   dures were made to ensure that the will of the peo-   ple will be voiced.                                  ",
      "280. It is however well settled for the last two   hundred years that the Constitution is the only   source of power in all three branches of the Federal   Government of the United States. The Supreme   Court stated and re-stated the said constitutional   position whether in war or in peace. It established      unfailingly:   <br>   “The Government of the United States was   born of the Constitution, and _all powers which   it enjoys or may exercise must be either derived      expressly_or_by implication from that instru-   ment” (Downes vs Bidwell 182 US 244, 288)\"      (Quoted from Cases on Constitutional Law by   Professor Noel T Dowling, Fifth Edition 1954,   page — 398).      ",
      "279. The Privy Council was of the view that   ‘there exists a separate power in the Judicature   which under the Constitution as it stands cannot be   usurped or infringed by the Executive or the   Legislature’. Section 29 (1) of the Constitution was   construed in this manner at page — 659 DE.   <br>   “Section 29(1) of the Constitution says:   “Subject to the provisions of this Order   Parliament shall have power to make Jaws for   the peace order and good government of the   Island.” These words have habitually been con-   strued in their fullest scope. Section 29(4) pro-   vides that Parliament may a   Constitution on_a two-thirds majority with a   certificate _of the Speaker. Their Lordships,   however, cannot read the words of s. 29(1) as   entitling Parliament to_pass legislation which   usurps the judicial power of the judicature-e.g.,   by_passing an_act of attainder against some per-   son_or instructing a judge to bring ina verdict   of guilty against some one who is being tried if   inlaw such usurpation would otherwise he con-   trary to the Constitution, There was speculation   during the argument what the position would be   if Parliament sought to procure such a result by   first amending the Constitution by a two-thirds   majority; but such a situation does not arise      here. In so far_as_any Act passed without   recourse to s. 29(4) of the Constitution purports   to usurp or infri the judicial power it is ultra   vires,”   <br>   Now let us turn towards the Constitution of the   United States.      ",
      "278. In the case of Livanage vs R (1967) 1 AC   259 = (1966) 1 All ER 650, although the Constitu-   tion of Ceylon did not expressly vest the Judicial   power exclusively in the Judiciary but the privy   Council found that fact alone was not decisive,   rather. the scheme of the Constitution particularly the   provisions relating to the judiciary, among others, led   the Privy Council to hold that the Constitution vested   the Judicial power exclusively in the Judiciary. This   case furnishes an instance where implied limitations   were inferred. After referring to the provisions with   regard to Judicature, Lord Pearce on behalf of the   Board explains at page - 658 EFG of (1966) 1 AER   650, that these provisions manifest an intention to   secure in the judiciary a freedom from political, leg-   islative and executive control.      ",
      "277. In the result, the Privy council dismissed   the appeal holding that the members of the panel   from which Bribery Tribunal were chosen were not   lawfully appointed to the Tribunal and as such, there   was a conflict between the Constitution of Ceylon      and the Bribery (Amendment) Act.      ",
      "276. Thereafter, Lord Pearce concluded at   page-199G-200C:   <br>   “The legislative power of the Ceylon   Parliament is derived from section 18 and sec-   tion 29 of its Constitution. Section 18 expressly   says “save as otherwise ordered in sub-section   (4) of section 29.” Section 29 (1) is expressed to   be “subject to the provisions of this Order.” And   any power under section 29 (4) is expressly      subject to its proviso. Therefore, in the case of   amendment and repeal _of the Constitution the      Speaker's certificate is a necessary part_of the   legislative process any Bill which does not   comply with the condition precedent of the pro-                         viso, is and remains, even though it receives the   Royal Assent. invalid__and_ultra_vires.      ",
      "275. In dealing with the issue, Lord Pearce   considered the case of Mc Cawley vsThe King 1920   AC 691 at page- 197G — 198F:<br>      ............a legislature has no power to       ignore_the conditions of law-making _that_are   imposed _by the instrument which itself regu-   lates its power to make law. This restriction   exists independently of the question whether   the legislature is sovereign, as is the legislature   of Ceylon, or whether the Constitution is   “uncontrolled,” as the Board held the Constitu-   tion of Queensland to be. .............. In   the present case, on the other hand, the legisla-   ture has purported to pass a law which, being in   conflict with section 55 of the Order in Council,   must be treated, if it is to be valid, as an implied      alteration of the Constitutional provisions about   the appointment of judicial officers. Since such   alterations, even if express, can only be made   by laws which comply with the special legisla-   tive procedure laid down in section 29 (4), the      Ceylon legislature has not got the general   power to legislate so as to amend __its   Constitution by ordinary majority resolutions,      .......            ",
      "274. In respect of the dispute in the case, his   Lordship raised the issue in deciding the question at   page — 196 BC:    <br>  “There remains the point which is the real   substance_of this appeal. When a sovereign      Parliament has purported to enact a bill and it   has received the Royal Assent, is it a valid Act   in the course of whose passing there was a pro-   cedural defect, or is it an_ invalid Act which   Parliament had no power in that _man-   ner      ",
      "273. That is exactly what we are doing in the   instant case in respect of the Proclamations etc, and   its subsequent ratification by the Constitution (Fifth      Amendment) Act.      ",
      "272. In the case of The Bribery Commissioner   vs Pedrick Ranasinghe 1965 AC 172, the Bribery   Tribunal of Ceylon tried and convicted Ranasinghe   on the bribery charges but it was alleged that the   members of the Tribunal were not lawfully appoint-   ed, rather, the provision for appointment offended   against an important safeguard of the Constitution   of Ceylon. The questions before the Privy Council   were as to whether the statutory provisions for the   appointment of members of the panel of the Bribery   Tribunal otherwise than by the Judicial Service   Commission conflict with Section 55 of the   Constitution, and, if so, whether those provisions are   valid.   <br>   Lord Pearce in course of his Judgment observed   at page- 194G:      “The court has _a duty to see that the   Constitution is not infringed and to preserve it   inviolate, Unless, therefore, there is some very   cogent reason for doing so, the court must not   decline to open its eyes to the truth,”      ",
      "271. That is exactly what we intend to do in   this case in considering some of the proclamations   etc. if not all, to find out the pith and substance of   the Fifth Amendment Act.            ",
      "270. Inthe case of Gallagher vs Lynn 1937 AC   86 in deciding the constitutional validity of an Act   passed by the Legislature of Northen Ireland in   1934, Lord Atkin held at pages — 869-70:   <br>   at the “ true nature and character of the leeisla-   tion”: Russell vs The Queen (1) “the pith and   substa nee of the legislation.” If on the view of   the statute as whole, you find that the substance   of the legislationis within the express powers   then it is not invalidated if incidentally it affects   matters which are outside the authorized field.   The legislation must not under the guise of   dealing with one matter in fact encroach upon   the forbidden field, Nor are you to look only al   the object of the legislature. An Act may have a   perfectly lawful object, e.g., to promote the   health of the inhabitants, but may seek to   achieve that object by invalid methods, e.g., 4                      direct prohibition of any trade with a foreign   country. In other words, you may certainly con-   sider the clauses of an Act to see whether they      are_ passed “in respect of” the forbidd sub-   ject.      ",
      "269. This decision is relevant for our purpose   because in every enactment, its pith and substance is   most important. In the above case, the legislation   invaded the civil rights, as such, declared invalid.   Similarly, the pith and substance of the Fifth   Amendment, in the instant case, is sought to ratify   and validate, the Proclamations etc.         ",
      "268. In the case of Attorney-General for   Canada vs Attorney-General For Ontario 1937 AC   355, in deciding the question as to whether the      Employment and Social Insurance Act, 1935, was   ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, Lord Atkin,   in pronouncing the Act ultra vires held at page —      367:   <br>   “ Dominion Legislation, even   though it deals with Dominion property, may   yet be so framed as to invade civil rights within      the province, or encroach upon the classes of   are reserved to Provincial com-   petence      ",
      "267. In this connection we would refer to the   decision of the Privy Council in the case of re The   Regulation And Control of Aeronautics In Canada   1932 AC 54 . In deciding the question regarding the   right of legislation to control and regulate aeronau-   tics and the air-stations in Canada as between the   Dominion and the Provinces, Lord Sankey LC, held   at page-70:   <br>   “      Great care must therefore be taken to consider   each decision in the Jight of the circumstances   of the case in view of which it was pronounced,   especially in the interpretation of an Act such as      the British North America Act, which was a   great constitutional charter, and not to allow   general phrases to obsecure the underlying   object of the Act, which was to establish a sys-   tem of government upon essentially federal   principles. Useful as decided cases are, it is      always advisable to back words of the   Act itself and to remember the object with   which it was passed.      ",
      "266. This decision is relevant for our purpose   because Article 142 of the Constitution of Bangla-                      desh clearly laid down the procedure for amendment   of any provision of the Constitution but Khondaker   Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad   Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahn   in exercise of their autocratic and illegal power,   only made our Constitution subservient to the   Martial Law Proclamations etc. but also changed the   basic structure of the Constitution according to their   free will without caring a fig about the procedure   laid down in the Constitution. Even Article 142   itself was changed illegally, presumably, to impede   further amendment, so that subsequent Parliaments   may not brought back the original provisions of the      Constitution, by way of amendment.            ",
      "265. The importance of this decision lies in the   strict adherence to the procedure spelt out in section   7A of the Constitution Act 1902 . It was intra vires to   section 5 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865   and unless the manner as required in section 7A is   meticulously followed the proposed amendment   could not be made.      ",
      "264. On consideration of the relevant provi-      sions, his Lordship held at page-709-712:   <br>   “Narrow constructions were placed by   colonial judges upon the instruments creating   constitutions in colonial Legislatures. Causes of   friction multiplied, and soon 4 conflict   emerged, analogous to that which is the subject   of discussion to-day, between those who insist-   ed that the constitutions conceded to the   colonies could be modified as easily as any      other Act of Parliament, and those who affirmed   that the statute defining such constitutions was                      “fundamental” or ‘organic“and that therefore,   the_constitution_was_controlled, .......We      observe, therefore, the Legislature in this isolat-   ed section carefully selecting one special and      individual & case in_which_limitations_are   imposed upon the power of the Parliamant of    Queensland to express and carry out its purpose   in the ordinary way, by a bare majority\"      His Lordship concluded at page -714;   <br>   “The Legislature of Queensland is the mas-   ter of its own house hold, except in so far as its   powers have in special cases been restricted. No   such restriction has been established, and none   in fact exists, in such a case as is raised in the   issues now under appeal. It follows, therefore,   that s. 6 of the Industrial Arbitration Act, 1916,   was not ultra vires. The Legislature was fully   entitled to vary the tenure of the judicial office.”   <br>   The importance of Mc Cawley’s case is   that the Privy Council recognized that special   procedure for amendment of the Constitution   Act, 1867, may be made and unless such special   procedure’s are prescribed, amendment of a   provision of the Act may be made in the same   way as any other legislation. This brings fore   the theory of the distinction between the flexi-   ble and the rigid Constitution in actual practice.   <br>   Next we shall consider the case of   Attorney-General for New South Wales vs   Trethowan 1932 AC 526 . In the said case, the   Constitution Act, 1902 of New South Wales,      \" was amended by the Act of 1929, adding sec-      tion 7A. The said provision provided that no bill   to abolish that Legislative Council or repealing   section 7A, should be presented for Royal   Assent until approved by the electors in accor-   dance with that section. But in 1930, without   complying with the requirements of section 7A,   two bills were passed one repealing section 7A   and the other abolishing the Legislative council.   The question arose whether the Parliament of   New South Wales has power to abolish the   Legislative Council of the State, or to alter its      constitution or powers, or to repeal section 7A   of the Constitution Act, 1902, except in the   manner provided by the said section 7A. Lord   Sankey LC, found at page -539-41:   <br>   ............. The question then arises,   could that Bill , a repealing Bill after its passage   through both chambers, be lawfully presented   for the Royal assent_ without having first   received the approval of the electors in the pre-   scribed_manner? In their Lordships’ opinion,      the Bill could not lawfully be so presented. The   proviso in the second sentence of s.5 of the Act   of 1865 states a condition which must be _ful-   filled before the legislature can validly exercise   its power to make the kind of laws which are   referred to in that sentence. In order thats. 7A   may be repealed (in other words, in order that   particular law \"respecting the constitution   powers and procedure” of the “legislature   may be validly made) the law for that purpose      must have bee in the manner required   by s. 7A, a colonial law for the time being in   force in New South Wales.”      Then his Lordship held at page -541:   <br>   “In the result, their Lordships are of opin-   ion that s. 7A of the Constitution Act, 1902, was   valid and was in force when the two Bills under   consideration were passed through the Legis-   lative Council and the Legislative Assembly.      Therefore these Bills could not be presented to   the Governor for His Majesty’s_assent_unless   and_until_a majority of the electors voting had         ",
      "263. In this case, the appointment of Mc   Cawley as a Judge of the Queensland Supreme   Court, under section 6 of the Industrial Arbitration   Act, 1916, passed by Queensland Parliament, was      challenged on the ground that the said provision was   contrary to sections 15 and 16 of the Constitution   Act, 1867 . The challenge was upheld by the   Queensland Supreme Court and the High Court of   Australia, On appeal, the Privy Council reversed the   said decisions. Lord Birkenhead, LC held at page -   703-4:<br>   “The first point which requires considera-   tion depends upon the distinction between con-   stitutions the terms of which may be modified   10 other formality than is nec-   essary in the case of other legislation, and con-   stitutions which can only be altered with some   special formality, and in some cases by a spe-   cially convened assembly.   <br>   .......Thus when one of the learned   judges in the Court below said that, according   to the appellant, the constitution could be   ignored as if'it were a Dog Act, he was in effect   merely expressing his opinion that the constitu-   tion was, in fact, controlled. If it were uncon-   trolled, it would be an elementary common-   place that in the eye of the law the legislative   document or documents which defined it occu   pied precisely the same position as a Dog Act or   any other Act, however humble its subject-mat-   ter.      ",
      "262. This character of the Constitution was   also noted by the Privy Council in the case of Mc   Cawley vs The King 1920 AC 691 . Lord Birkenhead,   LC, recognised a distinction between a rigid and   flexible Constitution. He, however, termed it as con-   trolled and uncontrolled Constitution.      ",
      "261. In re The Initiative and Referendum Act   1919 AC 935, in considering the validity of the Act   passed by the Legislature of Manitoba, Viscount   Haldane, held at page -943-5:   <br>                “The references their Lordships have   already made to the character of the office of   Licutenant-Governor, and to his position as   directly representing the Sovereign in. the   province, renders natural the exclusion of his   office from the power conferred on the   Provincial Legislature to amend the constitu-      tion of the Province.   <br>   ..... in accoedance with the analogy   of the British Constitution which the Act of   1867 adopts, the Lieutenant-Governor who rep-   resents the Sovereign is a part of the   Legislature.......It follows that if the   Initiative and Referendum Act has purported to   alter the position of the Lieutenant-Governor in   these respects, this Act was in_so_far_ultra   Vires.......... users Thus the _Licutenant-   Governor appears to be wholly excluded from   the new legislative authority. These considera-   tions are sufficient to establish the_ultra vires   character_ of the Act. The ending provisions   are in their Lordships’ view so interwoven into   the scheme that they are not_severable. The   Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865(1), therefore,   which was invoked in the course of the argu-   ment, does not assist the appellants.” (The   underlinings are mine)   <br>   The above Act envisaged removal of the   Lieutenant-Governor of the Province from par-   ticipation in the provincial legislative process,   contrary to section 9 of the British North   America Act, as such the said Initiative and   Referendum Act was held invalid.      ",
      "260. In 1867 the desire of Canada for a defi-   nite Constitution the embracing the entire Dominion   was embodied in the British North America Act.   Now, there can be no doubt that under this organic   instrument the powers distributed between the   Dominion on the one hand and the provinces on the   other hand cover the whole area of self -government   within the whole area of Canada. It would be sub-   versive of the entire scheme and policy of the Act to   assume that any point of internal self-government   was withheld from Canada.”<br>      His Lordship further held at page — 583:<br>      “In the interpretation of a completely self-   governing Constitution founded upon a written   organic instrument, such as the British North   America Act, if the text is explicit the text is      conclusive, alike in what it directs and what it   forbids, When the text_is ambiguous, as, for   example, when the words establishing two   mutually exclusive jurisdictions are wide      enough to bring a_particular_power within   either, recourse must be had to the context and   scheme of the Act. Again, if the text says noth-   ing expressly, then it is not _to_be presumed   that the Constitution withholds the power allo-   gether, On the contrary, it is to be_taken_tor   granted that the power is bestowed in some   quarter unless it be extraneous to the statute   itself (as, for example, a power to make laws for   some part of His Majesty's dominions outside   of Canada) or other wise is clearly repugnant to   its sense, For whatever belongs to self-govern-   ment in Canada belongs either to the Dominion   or to the provinces, within the limits of the   British North America Act.”   <br>   (The underlinings are mine)      ",
      "259. The basic principles of construction of a      Constitution were enunciated by Earl Loreburn   L.C., in the case of Attorney-General for Ontario V.   Attorney-General for Canada 1912 AC 571 at page   — 581:<br>      “The real point raised in this most impor-   tant case is whether or not an Act of the   Dominion Parliament authorizing questions   either of law or of fact to be put to the Supreme   Court and requiring the judges of that Court to   answer them on the request of the Governor in   Council is a valid enactment within the powers      that Parliament. Much care and learning have   been devoted to the case, and their Lordships   are under a deep debt to all the learned judges   who have delivered their opinions upon this   anxious controversy.      ",
      "258. In this connection the discussion of AV   Dicey in his celebrated work ‘An Introduction to the   Study of the Law of the Constitution’ (10th Edition)   at pages 146 -150 is illuminating:   <br>   “The constitution must be what | have   termed a “rigid” or “inexpensive” constitution.   <br>   The law of the constitution must be either      legally immutable, or_else_capable_of being   changed only by some authority above and   beyond the ordinary legislative bodies, whether      federal or state legislatures, existing under the   constitution,<br>      In spite of the doctrine enunciated by some   jurists that in every country there must be found   some person or body legally capable of chang-   ing every institution thereof, .---------- The ques-                    tion, however, Whether a federal constitution   necessarily involves the existence of some ulti-   mate sovereign power authorised to amend or   alter its terms is of merely speculative interest,   for under existing federal governments the con-   stitution Will be found to provide the means for   its OWN improvement............. Under a   federal as under a unitarian system there exists   a sovereign power, but the sovereign is in a fed-   eral state a despot hard to rouse. He is not, like   > English Parliament_ever-wakeful legislator   but a monarch  who slumbers and sleeps,   The sovereign of the United States has been   roused to serious action but once during the   course of more than a century. It needed the   thunder_of the Civil War break his repose,   and it may be doubted whether anything short   of impending revolution will ever again arouse   him to activity. But_a monarch who slumbers   for years is like a monarch who does not exist.   A federal constitution is capable  of change, but   for all that_a federal constitution is apt to be   unchangeable.<br>      Every legislative assembly existing under a      federal constitution is merely a subordinate   law-making body, whose laws are of the nature   of by-laws, valid whilst within the authority   conferred upon _it by the constitution, but      invalid or unconstitutional if they go beyond      limits of such authority.”      ",
      "257. People of many a modern countries has   got a say in the Constitutions of their countries and   so also in its amendments, as such, provisions are   made in the Constitutions of the Republic of Ireland,   Denmark, Commonwealths of Australia,   Switzerland and the States of the United States, pro-   viding for referring the proposed amendments to the   people, after it has been passed by the legislatures.   This highlights the sovereignty of the people.      ",
      "256. In framing a Constitution, the will of the   ‘people’ of the concerned Republic is the most   important factor. Although as a matter of fact, the   people never frames a Constitution but the   Constitution must, of necessity, reflects their ideals,   their hopes their aspirations in general, otherwise, it   will not come from the people, rather it would tan-   tamount to imposing upon them, necessitating   enactment and adoption of one Constitution after   another. In the language of K.C. Wheare in the   ‘Modern Constitutions’ at page - 67:   <br>   “CONSTITUTIONS, when they are   framed and adopted, tend to reflect the domi-   nant beliefs and interests, or some compromise   between conflicting beliefs and interests, which   are characteristic of the society at that time.   Moreover, they do not necessarily reflect polit-   ical or legal beliefs and interests only, They   may embody conclusions or compromises upon   economic and social matters which the framers   of the Constitution have wished to guarantee or      to proclaim. A Constitution is indeed the result-   ant of a parallelogram of forces political, eco-   nomic and social-which operate at the time of   its adoption” <br>      As such, when a Constitution is framed it com-   mands veneration and highest respect from all   because, il is the supreme law of the land and the   Government and all other Institutions are subordi-   nate to the Constitution. The people in that view of   the matter regards their Constitution as their guaran-   tee of their own rights, duties and obligations   towards the state and vice versa, as such, they would   regard it as their own Constitution. Generally the   people would not like any unilateral lighthearted   attempt to change the Constitution, rather, would   like to preserve it against all odds even against a   usurper.      ",
      "255. So far a rigid Constitution is concerned,   we first think about the Constitution of the United   States. The United States has a written Constitution,   one of the earliest. Besides, special procedure has   been provided for amendment of the said Constitu-   tion. Similarly most of the European and American   Constitutions are rigid. The only exceptions as could   be gathered, are the Constitutions of Singapore and   New-Zealand. Those Constitutions, though written   but can be altered by ordinary legislative process so   also the Constitutions of the Australian States which   are written but largely flexible.      ",
      "254. By way of example of flexible   Constitution, United Kingdom may be cited as one.   Firstly because there is no written Constitution   being the supreme law, creating the Parliament or   other Institutions of the State. Secondly, there is no   distinction between the status of various laws enact-   ed by the Queen in Parliament. Thirdly, amendment   of any law can be made by the Iegislature without   any special procedure as in the case of a written      rigid Constitution.      ",
      "253. As such, of necessity some special strin-   gent procedure is provided for in the Constitution   itself to allow such an amendment, This however,   depends whether the constitution is a ‘flexible* one   or ‘rigid’. If the provision of the Constitution can be   changed with the same ease as that of an ordinary   law it is known as a flexible Constitution but when   the Constitution provides some special procedure   for the amendment of its provisions then it is known   as a rigid Constitution.                         ",
      "252. Incontradistinction to the amendment of   an ordinary legislation, Constitutions of most of the   countries provide for special procedure for amend-   ment of any provision of the Constitution. The rea-   son is and it is generally accepted that a C onstitution   is a fundamental or basic law of a country. It is being   the supreme law and when it is written, it is to be   treated as permanent. But it also acknowledged that   with the passage of time, the needs of the people, the   needs of the society as a whole may require re-   adjustment of some of the provisions of the Cons-   titution, keeping its basis and basics intact. In order   to provide such a mechanism, a provision for   amendment is invariably kept in the Constitution   itself,      ",
      "251. Letus first consider the general principle   with regard to the power of amendment of the   Constitution. Thereafter, we shall consider Article   142 of the Constitution of Bangladesh which con-   fers such power of amendment on the Parliament   and the Parliament alone.      ",
      "250. In May, 1977, in pursuance of the   Referendum Order, 1977 (MLO No.1! of 1977), a         Referendum was held and almost all the voters in   Bangladesh expressed their confidence in Major   General Ziaur Rahman, BU psc, and in his policies   and programmes. In due course, a general election   was held in 1979 and the Second Parliament was   commenced on April 1, 1979, although the Martial   Law was still continuing in Bangladesh. On the   April 6, 1979, as a sequel to the promulgation of   Martial Law, the Constitution (Fifth Amendment)   Act, 1979 was made by the Parliament and pub-   lished in Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary on April   7, 1979.      ",
      "249. Under the above noted Proclamations, a   couple of hundred MLRs and MLOs were made   from time to time to suit the needs of the usurpers,   since the promulgation of the Martial Law on   August 20, 1975, till it was withdrawn on April 7,   1979, All those MLRs and MLOs were also ratified   and validated by the Fifth Amendment, passed on      April 6, 1979.      Part XXII   Amendment of The Constitution      ",
      "248. Not only the Proclamations but also   Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Order   made under the various Proclamations, were also   ratified and validated.      ",
      "247. The main features of these changes of   the Constitution are:   <br>   (i) | These changes were made by a nomi-   nated President and CMLA—who had   no legislative power either to make a   law or abrogate any, not to speak of   any of the provision of the Constitu-      tion but it was done.   <br>   (ii) Votes of not less than two-thirds of the   total number of members of Parlia-                               ment is required to amend a provision   of the Constitution. No — Parliament   was in existence, on the said date on   April 23, 1977, but without following   the above noted procedure, as stipu-   lated in Article 142, the changes in   various provisions of the Constitution   were made by the above noted   Proclamation Order.   <br>   (iii) The above noted insertion and substi-   tution of provisions, among others,   made in the Constitution, changed its   basic character, as such, could not   even be done by the two-thirds of the   total number of members of the   Parliament.         <br>   (iv)The Constitution was made sub-   servient to the Proclamations, MLRs   and MLOs.      <br>      This is no amendment of the Constitution even   in the plane eyes, but destruction of the basic char-   acter of the Constitution by a Proclamation Order   issued by the CMLA. But the Second Parliament   ratified and validated the said Proclamation Order   No.1 of 1977 by the Fifth Amendment.      ",
      "246. This Proclamation Order changing the   Constitution, was made by the President and the   CMLA by amendment of the Proclamation dated   November 8, 1975 and November 29, 1976, read   with the Proclamation of August 20, 1975.      ",
      "245. The Fourth Schedule was added to vali-   date the transitional and temporary provisions made   since the declaration of independence on March 26,   1971 till 16th December, 1972, when the   Constitution became effective. But this paragraph   3A was added to validate all the proclamations made   since August 20, 1975 with amendments and all   other acts, actions, MLRs and MLOs and proceed-   irigs taken thereunder till the date when the Martial   Law would be withdrawn.      ",
      "244. It should also be noted that in pursuance   to the Order dated April 21, 1977, Major General   Ziaur Rahman, BU psc, must have taken the follow-   ing oath before entering the office of President:   <br>   The English text is :  <br>    “I, The President.-An oath (or affirmation)   in the following form shall be administered by   the Chief Justice. (after amendment by   Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed by his Procla-   mation dated August 20, 1975):      “I................., do solemnly swear (or affirm)   that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the   office of President of Bangladesh according to   law :   <br>   That I will bear true faith and allegiance to   Bangladesh:   <br>      That I will preserve , protect and defend the Constitution<br>   And that I will do right to all manner of   people according to law, without fear or favour,      affection or ill — will. ..........      ”      (The underlinings are mine)   <br>   But only 2(two) days later, on April 23, 1977.   ations (Amendment) Order, 1977   (Proclamation Order No.1 of 1977) (Annexure-L-1).   extensive changes by way of amendment was made   which not only changed the Constitution but      defaced it beyond recognition.   <br>         Besides, Paragraph 3A was inserted after      Paragraph 3, in the Fourth schedule to the      Constitution.      ",
      "243. Besides, Major General Ziaur Rahman,      BU psc, being appointed as the Chief of Army Staff      on the August 22, 1975, by Khandaker Moshtaque   Ahmed, was still in the active service in the   Republic of Bangladesh, when he entered the office   of the President. It should be noted that by virtue of   his office as President, the Supreme Command of   the defence services, of Bangladesh was vested in   him but at the same time he was a servant of the   Republic as the Chief of Army Staff.      ",
      "242. We have already stated above that a   proclamation is not a law and by proclamation nei-   ther a law can be made nor a law can be abrogated   not to speak of the provisions of the Constitution. As   such, the First Proclamation along with clause aa is   non-est in the eye of law and the nominations of   both Justice Sayem and Major General Ziaur   Rahman BU psc, as President were in total violation   of the Constitution, without jurisdiction and without      lawful authority.                      ",
      "241. It is amazing that when even a chairman   of a Union Council has to be elected and can not be   nominated, nomination could be made to the highest   office of the Republic and even that was done by a   Proclamation. This is a disgrace and insult to the   Nation-hood of Bangladesh. But this insult was rat-   ified by the Second Parliament in the Constitution      (Fifth Amendment) Act.      ",
      "240. The office of President has been created   by Article 48 of the Constitution. The qualification   and election to the office of President has been stip-   ulated in the said provision. But there is no provi-   sion for nomination to the office of President in the   entire Constitution. From the language of the Order   dated April 21, 1977, it appears that this provision of   nomination was added by clause (aa) to the First   Proclamation by subsequent amendment.      ",
      "239. From the Order dated April 21, 1977, we   could learn that Justice Sayem became President of   Bangladesh on being nominated by Khondaker   Moshtaque Ahmed. Justice Sayem similarly nomi-   nated Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU psc, as the   next President of Bangladesh.      ",
      "238. Subsequently, Justice Sayem nominated   Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc, to be the   President of Bangladesh and also handed over the   office of President to him.      ",
      "237. In due course, Justice Sayem by the   Third Proclamation, handed over the office of   Martial Law Administrator to Major General Ziaur   Rahman, BU, psc, to act as the CMLA,      ",
      "236. But the Second Parliament, by the   Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, ratified all his   such illegal functions and actions.         ",
      "235. We ourselves tried to probe but could not   find any. The Constitution or any other law did not   provide so. Besides, the concept of Martial Law is   totally absent in our Constitution or in any other law   or jurisprudence. The Constitution, the supreme law   of the country, does not provide it nor any other law   of our country. There is no place or office of CMLA   in our jurisprudence. Obviously, the then Chief   Justice of Bangladesh, completely ignored these   legal realities for reasons best known to him but for   that reason his taking over as the President of   Bangladesh and assumption of the powers of CMLA   would not become legal. Even a Chief Justice is not   above the law. He is accountable for all his actions   just like the humblest citizen of this country. He   betrayed his oath to preserve, protect and defend the   Constitution. He was obliged to do it with his life   but he failed miserably. As a citizen, under Article      21, it was his duty to observe the Constitution, the’      laws and to maintain discipline but he failed, We   find that his such actions were beyond the ambit of   the Constitution and the ordinary laws of the land,   As such, he was a usurper to the office of President   of Bangladesh and his assumption of the powers of   CMLA, a legally non-existent office, was void and   non-est in the eye of law. Consequently, all his sub-   sequent actions taken by way of amendment of the   Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, MLRs,   MLOs and Ordinance, issued from time to time   being beyond the ambit of the Constitution, were   also all illegal, void ab initio and non est.      ",
      "234. On our query as to how and under what   Jaw Justice Sayem, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh,   could take over as the President of Bangladesh and   also assumed the powers of CMLA, the learned   Additional Attomey-General was without any answer.      ",
      "233. Justice Sayem remained CMLA ull   November 29, 1976 and resigned from the office of                         President on April 21, 1977, During this time, a   huge number of MLRs and MLOs were issued.   Besides, various provisions of the Constitution were   amended from time to time by amendment of the   Second Proclamation.      ",
      "232. Earlier, although Martial Law was   clamped on the country since August 15, 1975 but   apparently no Martial Law Administrator was   appointed but this time Justice Sayem by the   Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, made some   modifications in the earlier proclamation and also   appointed the Chief of Army Staff, Major General   Ziaur Rahman BU psc; the Chief of Naval Staff.   Commodore MH Khan, PSN, BN and the Chief of   Air Staff, Air Vice Martial MG Tawab SJ, SBt, PSA,   BAF, as Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators.      ",
      "231. The office of CMLA is a relic from the   past. In the erstwhile Pakistan, General Ayub Khan   was appointed CMLA by the Proclamation dated   October 7, 1958 and again General Yahya Khan   declared himself as the CMLA on March 25, 1969.      ",
      "230. This narration of the events may not be      absolutely accurate but the real facts may never be   known and in any case not very necessary for decid-   ing the legal issues involved in this Tule but stated   only as a sequel leading to the assumption of office      of President by Justice Sayem. But how and what   chain of events led the Chief Justice of Bangladesh   to become not only the President of Bangladesh but   also the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA).   is far from clear. But in any case he was there as the   President of Bangladesh and the CMLA as apparent   from the Proclamation dated November 8, 1975.      ",
      "229. The ‘reign’ of Khandaker Moshtaque   Ahmed lasted for 82 (eighty two) days. On   November 6, 1975 he handed over the office of   President of Bangladesh to Justice Abu Sadat   Mohammad Sayem. The history and the reasons      which led Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed to abdicate   in favour of Justice Sayem were not explained to us   with any details. All we could gather from the sub-   missions made by the learned Advocates and their   written arguments that there was a coup and a count-   er coup during the first week of November. 1975.   the chain of command in the Army in Dhaka   Cantonment broke down, large sections of Army   personnel revolted leading to the whole-sale killing   of a large number of officers of the Army. Colonel   Taher rescued Major General Ziaur Rahman BU.pse   the Chief of Army Staff, from his residence in the   Cantonment.      ",
      "228. But the Second Parliament by the   Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, ratified their   such actions, such as, illegal changing of the   Constitution without any authority, suspension of   the Constitution, ousting the jurisdiction of the   Supreme Court, etc.      ",
      "227. We repeatedly enquired about any legal   basis for such seizure of office of President but   received no satisfactory answer from the learned   Additional Attomey-General. Apparently, Khanda-   ker Mostaque Ahmed with the active aid and assis-   tance of a section of the Armed Forces, grabbed the   office of President and the Government of   Bangladesh. All these were done on August 15,   1975 . Five days later, on the 20th August, the   Proclamation was made, declaring Martial Law in   the country. By the Proclamation, the Constitution,   the supreme law of the country, was suspended and   the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was ousted.   We along with the learned Additional Attorney-   General and other leamed Advocates for the peti-   tioner as well as the respondent No.3, searched for   any semblance of legal basis for all these actions but   could not find any. It appears that Khandaker   Moshtaque Ahmed along with his conspirators sim-   ply seized the Government by the muzzle of the   guns. They grossly violated the Constitution. They   were usurpers plane and simple.      ",
      "226. During normal times, everything is gen-   erally routine and rational but it is the time of crisis   which puts a nation and its people on test. On the   morning of August 15, 1975, we failed to uphold the   Constitution and the laws made thereunder inspite   of our oath. It remained in the book not in our hearts.      ",
      "225. It appears that on the early morning of   August 15, 1975, Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed   merrily changed the Constitution of Bangladesh and   seized the office of President although without any   legal authority. All the other Commanding Officers   of the Armed Forces readily declared their alle-   giance to the new ‘President’ and his ‘Government’                         apparently without any protest although on their   commission as officers, they all took oath to be   faithful to Bangladesh and its Constitution and bear   true allegiance to the President.      ",
      "224. The Proclamation dated August 20, 1975   was made by Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed, a   Minister in the Cabinet of the Government of   Bangladesh. As a Minister, he had specific functions   under the Constitution but by any stretch of imagi-   nation, it did not authorize him to seize the oflice of   President of Bangladesh. No authority or legal pro-   vision has been mentioned in the Proclamation jus-   tifying his such assumption of power.      ",
      "223. But by proclamations, laws cannot be   made and in all the Constitutions of the civilized   world the power to legislate is always with the con-   cerned legislative body or authority as spelt out in   the respective Constitutions.      ",
      "222. Another example of proclamation is the   declaration of Independence on March 26, 1971,   followed by the formal Proclamation of Indepen-   dence of Bangladesh itself made on July 10, 1971, at   Mujibnagar, made on behalf of the Constituent   Assembly. This proclamation ushered the birth of a   new nation, our People’s Republic of Bangladesh.   The first paragraph of the Preamble of our   Constitution also recognized such proclamation of   Independence on March 26, 1971.      ",
      "221. The Declaration of Independence adopt-   ed on July 4, 1776, by the Continental Congress of   the Colonies was also a proclamation. It announced   the birth of a new nation of the United States.      ",
      "220. Halsbury’s Laws of England (Fourth   Edition Vol. 8) describes Royal Proclamation in this   manner:   <br>   “1098 . Use of proclamations, Proclama-   tions may be legally used to call attention to the   provisions of existing laws, or to make or alter   regulations over which the Crown has a discre-   tionary authority, either at common law or by   statute. Thus, the Crown may by proclamation   summon or dissolve Parliament, declare war or   peace, and promulgate blockades and lay   embargoes on shipping in time of war,.,..,      1099 . Restrictions on proclamations.   Under the general rule which restrains the   Crown from legislating apart from Parliament,   it is well-settled law that the Sovereign’s   proclamation, unless authorized in that behalf         by statute, cannot enact any new law, of make   provisions contrary to old ones      <br>      In modern times, the purpose of a Royal   Proclamation was confined and restricted to notify   the existing law but can neither make law nor abro-   gate any.      ",
      "219. King James | asked Sir Edward Coke,   Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, his opinion about   the right of the Kings to issue proclamations. To his   such query, Chief Justice Coke, Chief Justice   Fleming, Chief Baron Tanfield and Baron Altham   delivered their opinion thus :   <br>   “The King cannot create any offence which   was not an offence before, for then he may alter   the law of the land in his proclamation in some      high point... ~The Law of England is divided   into three parts; the common law, statue law,   and custom; but the King's proclamation is   none of these... The king has no prerogrative   but that which the law of the land allows him\"      (The underlinings are mine). (Reported in 2   State Tr 726, Quoted from Halsbury’s Laws of   England, Fourth Edition, Vol. 8, note-3 to Para-   1099).   <br>   Their such bold opinion four hundred years ago   in ]610 could give a check to the arbitrary exercise   of power by the Crown, but four hundred years later,   the learned Additional Attorney-General of   Bangladesh, contended that the Judges of the   Supreme Court of Bangladesh, are not entitled to   say so in respect of the Fifth Amendment Act, since   there was an ouster clause.      ",
      "218. In those ancient days the Monarchs used   to rule by divine right but by 17th century it was   established that the source of the Regal power was   the common law of the land.                      ",
      "217. During ancient times proclamations   were a source of law in England. King Henry the   VIII (1509-1547) used to assert his power to make   laws by way of proclamations. By the Statute of   1539, the King could legislate by Proclamations   without Parliament. This Act was, however,   repealed during the reign of Edward VI (1547-   1553), Still Mary I (1553-1558) and Elizabeth |   (1558-1603) used proclamations, but much less fre-   quently than their father.      ",
      "216. Let us first consider what is a proclama-   tion. The meanings given in the Chambers   Dictionary are ‘an official notice given to the pub-   lic’, ‘a proscription’ etc. According to Black’s Law   Dictionary proclamation means ‘a formal public   announcement made by the government.’ Generally   proclamations are used for declarations of war and   peace made on behalf of the Sovereign or the   Republic.      ",
      "215. We have already narrated above the   Proclamations dated August 20, 1975, November 8.   1975 and also November 29, 1976.      ",
      "214. Since clause (O) of this Proclamation      bestowed the President with such power which   sought to subordinate the Constitution. the said   clause (O) is invalid, void and ultra vires to the      Constitution.      Part XXI   Proclamations      ",
      "213. It may be noted that Paragraph 18 in the   Fourth Schedule of the Constitution, inserted by the      Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, ratified,   confirmed and validated all proclamations, among   others, made during the period from August 15.   1975 to April 9, 1979 . As such, the Proclamation   published on April 7, 1979, also stood ratified. con-   firmed and validated, including the aforementioned   ‘supra Constitutional’ power of the President.      ",
      "212. This was all very good but in the course   of narrating the directions, it again sought to subor-   dinate the Constitution when clause (O) of the   Proclamation divulged that the President may make      any order ‘notwithstanding anything contained in   the Constitution’. The President does not have any   such power ‘notwithstanding anything contained in   the Constitution’ either now or at any time since   December 16, 1972, still, this Proclamation   bestowed such ‘supra Constitutional’ power on the   then President of Bangladesh.      ",
      "211. This Proclamation was published in   Bangladesh Gazette, Extra-ordinary on April 7,   1979, It proclaims the following :   <br>   (i) In the interest of peace, order, securily,   progress, prosperity and development,   Bangladesh was placed under Martial   Law on August 15, 1975.   <br>   (ii) The said Martial Law stood withdrawn   on and from April 6, 1979 at 8-00 pm.   <br>   (iii) The Proclamations were revoked and the   MLRs and MLOs stood repealed from   the above date and time.      But,   <br>   (iv) The President may, to remove any diffi-   culty, make any provisions notwith-   standing anything contained in the   Constitution or any other law for the   time being in force.   <br>   This was possibly the last proclamation issued   by the Chief Martial Law Administrator.   <br>   It appears that the Parliament was already in   session and the Constitution (Fifth Amendment)   Act, 1979 had already been enacted and was pub-   lished in Bangladesh Gazette on April 6, 1979.   <br>   Although this Proclamation frankly gave the   reasons for imposing Martial Law on August 15,   1975 and also revoked the Martial Law.      ",
      "210. However, Article 92A was omitted by   Section 10 of the Constitution (Twelfth Amend-   ment) Act, 1991 (Act XXVIII of 1991). By this   amendment the Parliamentary form of Government   was restored, but the supervisory power of the   Supreme Court as given in the original Constitution.   over the Subordinate Judiciary was not restored. Il   remained with the Executive. That much of the   Fourth Amendment was not disturbed yet, as if, thal   was another piece of ‘democratic principle’ which   required to be kept intact.                         Part XX (O)   Proclamation dated April 6, 1979   <br>   [Published in the Bangladesh Gazette,   Extraordinary, dated the 7th April, 1979]      GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUB-   LIC OF BANGLADESH   OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MARTIAL LAW   ADMINISTRATOR   PROCLAMATION      WHEREAS in the interest_of Peace, order,   security, progress, prosperity and development      of the country the whole of Bangladesh was   placed under Martial Law on the 15th August,   1975;   <br>   AND Wuereas the situation in the country in   all respects has since improved, and all the   authorities and institutions in the country may   now properly function in accordance with the   Constitution and the law;   <br>   AND WHEREAS I, Lieutenant General Ziaur   Rahman, BU, having been elected as President   of Bangladesh under the Constitution in the elec-   tion held on 3rd June, 1978, have already entered   upon the office of President;   <br>   AND WHEREAS a Parliament has also been   elected under the Constitution and it is in session   now;   <br>   AND WHEREAS further continuance of   Martial Law is no longer necessary in the nation-   al interest and it needs be withdrawn;   <br>   AND WHEREAS for the said purpose it is now   necessary to revoke the Proclamations of the   20th August, 1975, and 8th November, 1975,   and the Third Proclamation of the 29th   November, 1976, and to repeal all Martial Law   Regulations an Martial Law Orders, and to make   provisions consequential and incidental thereto:   <br>   Now, THEREFORE in pursuance of the Third   Proclamation of the 29th November. 1976, read   with the Proclamations of the 20th August, 1975,      and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise of all   powers enabling me in that behalf, 1, Lieutenant   General Ziaur Rahman, BU, President of   Bangladesh and Chief Martin Law Administrator,   do hereby declare and direct as follows:   <br>   (a) at 8-00 PM on the 6th day of April.   1979, hereinafter referred to as the      commencing day, Martial Law   declared on the 15th August, 1975   shall stand withdrawn and the   Proclamations of the 20th August,   1975, and 8th November, 1975, and      the Third Proclamation of the 29th   November, 1976, together with all   other Proclamations and Orders   amending or supplementing them,   hereinafter referred to as the said   Proclamations, shall stand revoked:   <br>   (b) all Martial Law amd regulations and    Martil Law Orders made in pur-   suance of the said Proclamations, and      in force immediately before the com-      mencing day, shall stand repealed on   the commencing day........;   <br>   (0) the President may, for the purpose of   removing any difficulty that may   arise in giving effect to any provision   of this Proclamation make, by order,   such provisions as he deems neces-   sary or expedient and every such   order shall have effect notwithstand-   ing anything thine contained in the   Constitution or in any other law for   the time being in force.      DACCA;   <br>   The 6th April, 1979(0)   ZIAUR RAHMAN, BU,   <br>   Lieutenant General<br>   President and<br>   Chief Martial Law Administrator.   <br>   (The underlinings are mine)                      ",
      "209. It is surprising that although the Fourth   Amendment was dismantled brick by brick but the   office of the President was kept very much intact.   More surprise, by inserting Article 92A by the above   Order, the Parliament was made subservient to the   President, at the apex of the power, for all practical   purposes, because in an unlikely event, even if the   Parliament refuses to pass the budget, under the new   provision, the President without any worries about   the funds could dissolve the Parliament at his pleas-   ure. In this way the President of Bangladesh in 1978   became the most powerful Chief Executive in the   world virtually without any checks and balances   either from the Parliament or from any body else   which would have envied even by Oliver Cromwell,   the Lord Protector of England in 1653.      ",
      "208. Thereafter, the President and the CMLA, further repealed the Constitution by the Second    Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978   (Second Proclamation Order No. 1V of 1978).      The preamble of the said Order reads as fol-   lows:   <br>   “Whereas there has been persistent   demand for the repeal of the undemocratic pro-   visions of the Constitution incorporated therein   by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act,   1975;   <br>   AND Whereas some of such undemocrat-      ic provisions have already been repealed by the   President the Chief Martial Law      Administrator;   <br>   AND Wuereas the President and the Chief   Martial Law Administrator, in response to the      said popular demand, pledged to the nation to   repeal the remaining undemocratic provisions      after obtaining mandate from the people in the   election to the office of President, and he has      obtained that mandate;      <br>      AND Whereas it is expedient further to   amend the Proclamation of the 8th November,   1975, for the purposes of fulfilling the said   pledge and other purposes hereinafter appear-   ing;   <br>   Now, therefore, in pursuance to the Third   Proclamation of the 29th November, 1976, read   with the Proclamations of the 20th August,   1975, and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise   of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the   President and the Chief Martial Law   Administrator is pleased to make the following   Order .....   (The underlinings are mine)   <br>   It appears that by the said Order although the   most of the “undemocratic” provisions of the Fourth   Amendment were removed but the Presidential sys-   tem remained in tact, as if that was the only demo-   cratic principle in the Fourth Amendment so much   so that Article 92A was also inserted to make the   already powerful President more powerful. Earlier   even after the Fourth Amendment, no fund would      have been available to the President without having   the budget passed by the Parliament. But Article   92A unilaterally authorized the President to with-   draw money from the Consolidated Fund for a peri-   od of 120 days even without the approval of the   Parliament so that the President after dissolving a   dissident Parliament might elect a new Parliament.   Even James | or Charles I in early 17th Century did   not have such power in violation of the provisions of   Magna Carta. Lieutenant-General Oliver Cromwell   even purged the Parliament but could not get the   badly needed funds from the Commons for his army.      ",
      "207. By the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 (Second Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977) the Supreme Court was again made to consist of the Appellate Division and the High Court Division, with effect from December 1, 1977, with other ancillary amendments.     Part XX (N) Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978      ",
      "206. The Abandoned Properties (Supplemen- tary Provisions) Regulation, 1977, was made by the MLR No. VII of 1977 . This was published in the Bangladesh Gazette, Extraordinary dated 7th October, 1977 (Annexure-L).  ~ The MLR VII of 1977 was under consideration in the case of Halima Khatun vs Bangladesh 30 DLR (SC) 219 . Fazle Munim, J.(as his Lordship then was) very crudely depicted the correct picture of the said Regulation, His Lordship held at para-18:  “Under_the Proclamation which contains fhe aforesaid clauses the Constitution has lost  Its _character as Suprem law of the  country.......The present Constitutional provi- sion may, however, claim superiority to any law   other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation.”  At para-19, his Lordship further held: <br> “On reference to Clause (g) of the Proclamation of August 20, 1975, it is seen that no Court including the Supreme Court has any power to call in question in any manner what- soever or declare illegal or void the Proclamation or any Regulation or Order  His Lordship finally concluded at para-20: <br> “In consequence of these express provi-  sions jt w merel cking one's head against a stone wall if, one makes an attempt to et redress in a Court of law which, previous to this Regulation, might have granted relief if one could show that one's property  did not come  within the purview of the abandoned Property  Order.” (the underlinings are mine) <br> With great respect for the learned Judge we would acclaim that his Lordship very aptly depicted the inhuman face of the MLR. <br> Same kind of conclusions can be drawn in respect of other MLRs and MLOs.    Part XX (M) Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977     ",
      "205. In continuation of these kinds of Procla- mations, The referendum Order. 1977, was made by the Martial Law Order No.l of 1977, in order to ascertain the confidence of the people in the President and the CMLA. This MLO was published in the Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary on the Ist May, 1977 . The preamble of the MLO reads as fol-  lows:<br> THE REFERENDUM ORDER, 1977 <br> Martial Law Order No.1 of 1977. <br> WHEREAS, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator in his address to the Nation on the 22nd April, 1977, declared that, to ascertain the confidence of the people in him and in the policies and programmes enunciated by him, a countrywide referendum would be held on the 30th May, 1977, on the basis of direct adult franchise; <br> And whereas it is necessary to provide for the conduct of the said referendum; <br> Now, therefore, in pursuance of the Third Proclamation of the 29th November, 1976, read with the Proclamations of the 20th August, 1975, and 8th November, 1975, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator in pleased to make the following Martial Law Order :    paragraph 2(f) defines the word ‘referen- dum’in this manner:<br> (f) “referendum™ means the referendum held under this Order. <br> paragraph 3 mentions the question for ref-  erendum: <br> «3 . Question for referendum.—There shall be held on the 30th May, 1977, in accor- gance with the provisions of this Order, a refer- endum on the question whether or not the vot- ers have confidence in President Major General Ziaur Rahman, B.U. and in the policies and pro- grammes enunciated by him. <br> On consideration of this MLO it appears: <br> (i) The referendum was conceived and con- ducted under the MLO No.1 of 1977, <br> (ii) This was done in order to ascertain the confidence of the voters in President Major General Ziaur Rahman, <br> (iii) This kind of referendum is unknown to the Constitution, or any law of the land.

      "48. In the result, all these Rules are discharged  but without any order at to cost.    The order of direction given at the time of  issuance of the Rule by this Division is hereby  recalled.     <br>                            HIGH COURT DIVISION  (Criminal Revisional Jurisdiction)  <br>  Salma Masud Abdus <br>   Chowdhury J Satta  Md Rezaul Hasan J <br>  Judgment  April 19th, 2010. <br>   Sattar alias Taku  Petitioner  <br>  State. <br>  ",
      "47. That being the position, we are constrained  to hold that the service render by the petitioners in  connection with new contract is absolutely in the  nature of ‘Surveyor’ and not that of ‘Consultants’.  The submissions made by the learned Counsel for  the respondents merits substance and consequently  these Rules should be discharged.    ",
      "46. Beside, we want to view the present issue  from another angle also. If we deeply analyze the  issue before us on the basis of discussion as made  above one thing becomes latent and clear that there  are positive laws and rules concerning PSI Agency  in minute details and those Laws and Rules portrait  service rendered by PSI Agency as \"Surveyor\". But  nowhere in those Laws and Rules it could be found  that there has been any deliberation given in any  manner highlighting the PSI Agency as  \"Consultant\". In other words we can Say that no  elaborations under the scheme of Laws and Rules in  that respect are there to made us think that PSI  Agency are Consultants, Further in our query we  also asked the Counsel for the petitioner to show us.  the Articles and Memorandum of Association of  their respective companies to find out whether any  of their objective clauses expresses that PSI Agency  can do Consultancy but they failed to supply us the  Articles and Memorandum of Association of those  Companies.    ",
      "45. If we read section 2(qq) and section 25A(1)  and (2) of the Customs Act (as already mentioned)  together it becomes clear that whole scheme of the  Pre-Shipment inspection agency has been construed  absolutely in a restricted implication. That is to say  their main function is to perform inspection is terms  of section 25A(1) and (2), Manifestly, pre-Shipment  C 38    agencies perform the work of Surveyors and by any  stretch of imagination they cannot be blended as  Consultants.    ",
      "44. Section 2(qq) deals with the definition of  pre-Shipment Inspection agency.  <br>  It's says:  <br>  \"Pre-Shipment inspection agency\" means  any person appointed under section 25A as a  Pre-Shipment inspection agency and includes a  representative of that person.    ",
      "43. There is no denying that in the new con-  tract the petitioners have to provide consultancy  services in addition to the services rendered as  ‘Surveyors’ but it is only the additional duty of the  Petitioners to provide some consultancy services as  per terms of the contract. But the additional duties of  the petitioners do not put them in the category of the  consultants because as per PSI Rules and terms of  the contract, PSI Agencies are appointed to perform  these additional duties, Pertinently we would like to  mention here that even in the contract of the case  reported in // BLC (AD) 233 it would be found that  PSI Agencies were required to perform these addi-  tional work. Considering the said aspect. their  Lordships in that Decision finally held ;  <br>   \"It appears that the letter dated 11-3-2001  was written by the personnel of the National  Board of Revenue being quite unmindful of the  law and the facts and circumstances in the back-  ground whereof PSI Agency signed the    Contract with the Government for Tendering  PSI services and as such, the PSI Agency can-  not take advantage of the said letter, Moreover,  there was no occasion for dividing the service  of the PSI Agency as seen from the letter dated  11-3-2001 since the service of the PSI Agency  is a single transaction i.e. rendering of service  by the PSI Agency is reaching Customs House,  It is pertinent to mention that PSI Agency sub.  mitted the bid being fully aware of the nature of  the service it would render.    Further in that decision it has been observed :  <br>  \"It is seen from section 2(qq) of the  Customs Act that PSI Agency means a person  appointed under section 25A of the Customs act  as a Pre-shipment Inspection Agency and  includes a representative of the person. From  the provision of section 25A of the Customs Act  as stated thereinbefore, it is seen that the  Government for getting the services required to  be performed into Bangladesh would get the  said services performed through certain Agency  and that the said Agency is Pre-shipment  Inspection Agency. There is nothing in the pro-  vision of section 25A of the Customs Act that it  is the Government itself, which would perform  the services as mentioned in the said section in  respect of the importable goods. That for having  the things as mentioned in section 25A(2) of the  Customs act get done Government appointed  PSI Agency and the PSI Agency does the things  mentioned in section 25A(2) of the Customs  Act in exchange of fees or commission. In that  state of the matter, we are of the view that the  services rendered by PSI Agency in connection  with the goods imported into Bangladesh is the  services of the Agency itself and the said work  of the PSI Agency is not the work of the  Government. The services of the PSI Agency is  that service of an organization from whom serv-  ice would be received by the Government on  payment of fees or commission for the service  so rendered and as regard that provision has  been made in the VAT ACt...............                   section 2(qq) of the Customs Act is to be read  with the provision of section 25A of the said  Act and that when the provision of section 25A  of the Customs Act is read keeping in view the  TB to GAT Hee it will be seen that the per-  son, establishment or organization while ren-  dered service in respect of one of the categories  of the matters mentioned in the HI, the 101  and the definition in section 2(qq) of the  Customs Act are not inconsistent........ esse  the service of the PSI Agency starts in  Bangladesh, as is seen from the provision of  PSI Order, 1999 and then, for the purpose of  completeness of the work PSI Agency required  to perform the said agency after initiating its  function for the performance whereof and  Agency has been appointed the PSI Agency  goes to the foreign territory and performs the  remaining part of the work there, since it is the  requirement of the law that the goods are to be  verified/surveyed/inspected before shipment  for importing into Bangladesh and upon doing  part of the service in the foreign territory the  PSI Agency submits its certificate, i.e. when the  work undertaken by the PSI Agency is complet-  ed, in Bangladesh to the prescribed authority. It  may be mentioned PSI Agency, while partici-  pating in the bid being quite aware of the nature  of the work it would be required to perform.\"    ",
      "42. Mr Imam's argument fails since we could  not find out any ambiguity that has arisen while  interpreting fiscal law in this field when the relevant  laws and Rules with clarity classify the status of PSI  Agency to that of surveyor and not of Consultant.    ",
      "41. The whole function of the PSI Agency as  described in 25A of the Customs Act and in the con-  tract documents reveals in ascertainment of the cor-  rectness of the statement made by the importer in  respect of the goods to be imported, particularly as  to quality, quantity, price, description, HS Code  classification or, in other words, classification of  any goods as well as valuation. Further, the Customs  Authority rightly charged VAT on the services of the  PSI Agency as the Surveyors particularly on the  background of the explanation of the Surveyors.    ",
      "40. In the decision of NBR Chairman vs  Intertex Testing Services International Lid. 11 BLC  (AD) 233 their Lordships detined the word \"Survey\"  with clarity. It has been explained in that decision  that the word i lish  Dictionary means—amongst others the act of view-  ing, examinii r inspecting in detail specially for  some specific purpose. The word ‘verity’ conveys,                   amongst others, to ascertain or test the accuracy or  correctness of (something), specifically by examina-  tion or by comparison with known data and the  word verification: among others means, the action  of establishing or testing the truth or correctness of  faet, theory statement, ete, by means of special  investigation or comparison of data.    ",
      "39. On a close reading of all these definitions.  isions we geta a clear picture that the servic-    insviably connesicd with the affairs of survey,    (Underlined by us)    ",
      "38. The PSI agents are appointed by the  Government to do certain works in connection with  importable goods i.e. inspection of the goods, which  is imported into Bangladesh, and they render service  in lieu of fees and commission. In the contract of  employment of PSI agencies dated 22-6-2008 clause  17 reads as follows :  <br>  \"Taxes and duties 17.1 The PSI agency,  sub-contractors and personnel shall pay such  taxes duties, fees and other impositions as may  be levied under the governing, the amount of  which is deemed to have been included in the  contract price.\"    ",
      "37. In the General Conditions of Contract for  employment of PSI agency it was to provide \"cer-  tain cargo inspection sei as defined in this con-  tract\". The definition of Services is as follows :    1.1 (m) Services mean the task or activities  to be performed and the services to be provided  by the PSI agency pursuant to the contract  Agreement as outlined in the Terms of  Reference and pre-shipment Inspection Rules  2002.    ",
      "36. Certainly, these two terms cannot be put on  the same footing. They express two different conno-  tations. Let us now discuss what the functions of the  PSI Agencies are. At the very beginning of the  Public Procurement Rules, 2008, in Rule 2(31) we  find definition of Paramarshak (Consultant).        ",
      "35. From SRO 189/Ain/2008/491/Mushok  under VAT Act 1991 Annexure-F to the petition, we    found definition of Jarip Shangstha from explana-  tion to Jarip Shangstha. It says:                     ",
      "34. He has also drawn our attention to the  terms of reference from where it could be found that  for the entire period the newly appointed Ps}  Agencies will take steps to enhance the capacity of  the department and improve standard of both offi.  cers and staffs of Bangladesh Customs and transfer  all requisites knowledge and technology to strength.  en the customs department as a whole in order to  enable the department to run efficiently. These steps  are_indeed to our mind noble but the question  remains whether all these efforts put the Ps)  Agencies in the category of a Consultant? The deci.  rules issue.  ",
      "33. He further points out that the selection  method for awarding the final contract will follow  the guidelines laid down under Quality and Cost  Based Selection (QCBS) process and in accordance  with Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public  Procurement Rule 2008 of Bangladesh, however  available is to be disclosed. He put emphasis that in  case of any conflict between Public Procurement  Act, 2006, Public Procurement Rules, 2008 with  that of PSI Rules 2002 the procedure laid down in  Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public  Procurement Rules shall prevail as far as procure-  ment process is concerned. Mr Mahmudul Islam, the  learned Counsel for he respondents, on the other  hand. also put equal emphasis to this particular  aspect and tried to impress upon us that the Rule  shall prevail only as for as procurement process is  concerned. (underlined by us)    Mr Fida Kamal's contention is that with all these  trappings as it has been already discussed, the serv-  ice rendered by the PSI Agencies by implication  assumes the position of the Consultants.    ",
      "32. Mr Fida M Kamal, tried to impress upon us  by pin pointing some salient features of request for  Proposal (RFP) Annexure-C-1 to the petition that  the short listed applications who sent the letter of  invitation and the RFP were to submit in that regard  a proposal for supply of consulting service required  for the assignment.    ",
      "31. Now let us revert to (Annexure B-1) i.e. the  request for expression of interest for appoint of PSI  Agency. This is an advertisement published on 21st  May 2008 in the ‘Daily Star’ pursuant to notification  SRO No.255-Law/20021973/Customs dated 19th  September 2002 . In that advertisement in paragraph  3.0 the service required to be rendered by the PSI  Agency have been categorized. It says :  <br>  \"The main task of the PSI Agencies shall  be the following :  <br>  (a) To verify description, quantity and quali-  ty of goods as per invoices and packing  lists supplied by the exporters.   <br>  (b) To determine the correct HS Code of the    goods in accordance with existing law  and rules,  <br>               (c) To determine and certify correct value in    accordance with existing law and rules.  <br>  (d) To ensure compliance with shipment pro-  cedures and container sealing as per rules    and orders.  (ec) To issue CREs or NNRF after undertaking  proper inspection (physical or otherwise).  (1) To held prepare and sustain a valuation  database.        graph 5.0 says :—PSI Agencies will  be selected in accordance with the procedure set out  in \"Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public  Procurement Rules, 2008\" Interested Agencies may  obtain further information from the office of the  undersigned between 10-00 AM and 25-00 PM on  all working days. (Annexure-B-1).    ",
      "30. From the provision enunciated and enacted  in section 25A and 25B, it has been found that cer-  tificate issued by PSI agency was made the basis of  assessment of customs duty and other levies and that  certification by PSI agency was made compulsory  for the importers in respect of goods. It may be men-  tioned that under the provision of section 25A as  enacted in 1999 for certification of the imported  goods the PSI agency was appointed by the govern-  ment. Keeping all these things in view we can safe-  ly say that to specify the provision or exacting the  provision of the dimension of PSI Agency, govern-  ment by amendment made the very provisions of  section 25A and 25B and 25C of the Customs Act  1969 . The reason for bringing this is only to con-  strue the terms and limitations of the services to be  rendered by the PSI Agency as compulsorily have  been categorized by the Government.    ",
      "29. It may be mentioned that acceptance of the  certificate issued by the PSI agencies was optional  for the customs authority and that the matter of get-    ting imported goods verified and certified by PSI  agencies was optional for the Customs Authority  and was not compulsory. Latter on the government  by Finance Act 16 of 1999 substituted section 254  of the Customs Act 1969, and with that certificate  issued by the PSI Agency was made basis for assess-  ment of customs duties and other levies and verifi-  cation by PSI agency was made compulsory for the  importer in respect of the goods imported.    ",
      "28. Section 25A as it stands now quoted  below :   <br> \"[25A. Pre-shipment inspection agencies  and assessment on the basis of their certificates   <br>               (1) For the purposes of this Act, the Govern-  ment may, in the prescribed manner, appoint  shipment inspection agencies and deter-  mine the scope and manner of their certification  and related matters, <br>   (2) The Government may, by notification  in the oficial Gazette, declare that the quality,  quantity, price, description and customs classi:  fication of any goods verified and certified in  the prescribed manner by a_pre-shipment  inspection agency shall be accepted as the basis  for assessment.  <br>  (3) For the purposes of this section, \"price\"  means value of the goods determined in accor-  dance with sub-section (1) and (2) of section 25).\"    further section 25B of the Customs Act postulates:  <br>  5B Mandatory pre-shipment inspection-  It is mandatory for the importers to have their  importable goods inspected by a pre-shipment  inspection agency before or at the time of ship-  ment of those goods on board a vessel, aircraft  or other conveyance,    Provided that the Government may, by  notification in the official Gazette exempt any  class of goods or any goods imported by any  class of importers or any goods imported  through a customs port or a customs station or  any area within such port or station from the  mandatory pre-shipment inspection.\"    Section 25C states :  <br>  “Pre-shipment inspection service notifica-  tion in official Gazette, imposes pre-shipment  inspection service charge on imported goods  required to be inspected by  pre-shipment  inspection agencies at a rate not exceeding one  percent of the value of such goods and this  charge shall be collected as if it were a customs  duty leviable under section 18(1).\"    ",
      "27. At the very out, set let us digress a little and  try to trace back the history of the PSI Agency. As  per provision of section 25A of the Customs Act  1969 (inserted in the Customs Act by Finance Act  16 of 1999 upon repealing section 25A which was  inserted by Finance Act 11 of 1994) as well in the  light of the provision of PSI Order 1999 the service  es of the PSI agency was meant for the purpose of  \"Verification and Certification\" of the quality, quan-  tity, price description and classification of any goods  to be imported in to Bangladesh.    ",
      "26. Mr SM Moniruzzaman the Learned  Assistant Attorney-General for the respondents in  his brief submission highlighted the definition of the  Pre-Shipment Inspection Agency (PSI) Mentioned  in the section 2 (qq) and contends that as per said  definition the Pre-shipment: Inspection Agency    appointed under section 25A of the Customs Act and  service charge of the said PSI Agency mentioned in  section 25C of the Customs Act. As per section 25C  The Government may, by notification in the official  Gazette, impose pre-Shipment inspection service  charge on imported goods required to be inspected  by pre-shipment inspection agencies at a rate not  exceeding one percent of the value of such goods  and this charge shall be collected as if it were a cus-  toms duty leviable under section 18(1). And as such  the payment of service charge made by the importer  to the pre-shipment inspection Agency (PSI) regard-  ing to inspect of the imported goods and the said  act/service of the PSI Agency not consultancy, if is  purely G44 (Survey) as Sf Acg (surveyor). Thus  the PSI agent is liable to pay VAT @ 15%.    We have heard the learned Counsel for the peti-  tioners and the respondents at length and considered  their submissions. We have categorically perused  each and every Annexure with the petitions. We  have considered supplementary affidavit and reply  the affidavit-in-opposition.    The only question that falls for consideration by  this Division is whether the petitioners in terms of  their services rendered to the respondents would fall  under the category of ‘Consultants’ or ‘Surveyors’  and would be vatable instead of 13.04% to 4.5%.    ",
      "25. He adds that the government had decided  to appoint PSI agents for a further period of 16  months commencing from Ist September 2008 and  their functions and responsibilities are clearly stated  in the Terms of Reference (TOR) (section 6). It is  further submitted that the Government intended the  petitioners to provide consultancy service in addi-  tion to the service rendered as ‘Surveyors’. It is the  additional duty of the petitioners to provide some  consulting service as per the terms of the contract.  But these additional duties of the petitioner do not  put them in the category of consultants. In this  regard Ms Nahid Mahtab, the learned Counsel also  submits that even in reported decision of //° BLC  (AD) 233 this sort of additional duties of the  Consultants were there and their Lordships of the  Appellate Division decided that the service of the  PSI Agency are vatable as surveyors. So she candid-  ly submits that this is not a new phenomenon, it  cannot be inferred since there are some additional  functions regarding consultancy that have been  attributed to the PSI Agencies they have become  Consultants, this is absolutely agianst the rationable.  Therefore, these Rules should be discharged as they  have no substance.    ",
      "24. Highlighting all these provisions the  learned Counsel finally submits that PSI agencies  conducts training programs/study tours/inspection  program as per requirement of law under the PSI  Rules, 2000 which is described in Appendix 1 of the  Contract agreement. Moreover, in the umbrella con-  tract one on the small components, which is of con-  sulting service, does not put them to the category of  Consultants, The petitioners have rightly treated as  surveyors having agreed to do the work as per the  contract and there is nothing arbitrary action of the  respondents, The writ petitions are misconceived                             and incorrect. Merely because QCBS method is to  be used for selection of PST agent, they do not  beeome Consultants, particularly when they have  contracted principally to do the work of Surveyors.  Supplementary service as consultants by PSI agen-  cies is negligible and they having performed the  function of surveyors are entitled to pay VAT at the  rate of 15%. He also points out that the petitioners  do not have the license of a Consultant to show that  they are consultants under the Shulka Poramarshok  License Bidhimala, 2000, The said Bidhimala has  been annexed as (Annexure 1) of the affidavit-in-  opposition.    ",
      "23. Further he submits that PSI agents are ren-  dering diflerent kind of services, Consulting servic    es from a small component of the responsibilities of    the petitioners, The functions of PSI Agencies are  prescribed in Clause 8 of the PSI Rules, 2002 . In  addition to the functions under clause 8 the PSI    agencies have some responsibilities under clause 9  of the PSI Rules       ",
      "22. He further submits that the above men-  tioned services rendered by the PSI agencies are  services of the 'Surveyors\" as held by the Appellate  Division in 77 BLC (AD) 233 the decision referred  to above. The respondents have quite legally levied    /AT upon the agencies as 'Surveyors' on the fees  and commission received agianst the service ren-  dered by the agency. Moreover, the services ren-  dered by the agencies as mentioned above are in no  Way come under the consultation services as alleged  by the petitioners, He submits that the petitioners  services are not marked as having intellectual,  strategic character of the consultants rather the serv-  ices are of clerical in nature. The mere fact that the  works of the petitioners indicates additional servic-  es of consultancy in a very limited manner does not  render them a Consultants when principally they are  required under the agreement to perform the func-  tions of Ba Az, (Surveyors).    ",
      "21. Mr Mahmudul Islam, the learned Senior  Counsel appearing with Ms Nahid Mahtab, the  learned Counsel on behalf of the respondents by fil-  ing affidavit-in-opposition, reply to the supplemen-  tary affidavit filed by the petitioner, on the other  hand, vehemently opposes the Rule and submits that  this Rule should be discharged outright being  devoid of any substance. Mr Islam categorically  denied the submission made by the petitioners and  submitted that respondents had decided to appoint  the Pre-shipment Inspection Agencies (PSI) for a  new term pursuant to the provisions provided in Pre-  shipment Inspection Rules, 2002 (SRO No.255;  Law/2002/1973/Customs dated 9th September  2002 . The learned Counsel pointed out the main  tasks of the PSI Agents as laid down in the Rule  which are as follows :  <br>                a. To verity the description of quantity and  nd packing list supplied by the exporters,    quality of goods as per invoice  <br>   b. To determine the correct HS Code of the  goods in accordance with the existing  laws and Rules. <br>   c. To determine and certify correct value in  accordance with existing law and Rules. <br>   d. To ensure compliance with shipment pro-  cedures and container sealing with exist-  ing law and Rules. <br>   e. To issue CRFs and NNRF after under tak-  ing proper inspection (physical and other-  wise) prior to shipment of consignment to  be exported as per Rules,  <br>  f. To help prepare and sustain a valuation  Database.\"    ",
      "20. He then submits that the procurement  process provided for negotiation upon the terms of  the contract, specifically, the financial bid, and  hence the government had numerous opportunities  to rectify its representation had there been any ambi-  guity or inadvertent error therein. Any misrepresen-  tation in the contractual documents could have been  remedied by making necessary amendments prior to  petitioner signing the contract but yet the govem-  ment did not do so; this is clear manifestation of the  intention of the Government to treat the petitioners  as Consultants for all material purpose. The  Government, is thus prevented from going back  from its representation in the Tender Document  because of the doctrine of estoppel and the contra  preferentum rule of construction under which, it is  settled by the Hon'ble Appellate Division in the case  as referred to above that in the event of any ambi-  guity, which is denied, the document is to be inter-  preted agianst the person who prepared the same.    ",
      "18. Mr Akhter Imam, Senior Advocate, appear-  ing in writ petition No.5737 of 2009 submits that the  settled proposition of law is that if there is any ambi-  guity in the fiscal law arising out of any interpreta-  tion in particular, the benefit will go in favour of the  subject. On this point the leamed Counsel referred  to the decision of Sadharan Bima Corporation vs  Bengal Liner reported in_48_DLR (AD) 143 and  referred to paragraph 9 of the said decision where  the said proposition “of law has been propounded,  The learned Counsel emphatically submits that the  Vital decision of National Board of Revenue vs  Intertek Testing Services International Lid 11 BLC  (AD) 233 has only settled that the services of the PSI  Agencies are vatable and nothing more. It is now to  be decided by this Division the status of the peti-  tioners whether they would be termed as the  ‘Consultants’ or \"Surveyors\" since the earlier deci-    sion has given no light on the point.      ",
      "17. His another branch of argument is that the  government has appointed the petitioner through  QCBS method under the Public Procurement Act,  2006 and the Public Procurement Rules, 2008  (which is used only for the appointment of consult-  ants) the petitioners should, for all material purpos-  es be treated as a ‘Consultant’ and as such, the res-  pondents should collect VAT from the petitioners at  the rate of 4.5%    ",
      "16. From the obligations of the petitioners a  referred to above it could be found that their primary  obligation is to give effect to the Government poli-  cys the petitioners for all material purpose, are  Consultants and as such the deduction of VAT at the  rate of 13.04% is without lawful authority and is of    no legal effect.    ",
      "15. Next he submits that the PSI Scheme, |    which is acknowledged worldwide, had been intro-  duced to implement the Government’s policy to set  up an efficient Customs Department. As a means of  implementation of the Government's policy through  the PSI Agent, the Customs Act 1969 was amended  making PSI schemes mandatory and further impos-  ing penalty if goods are imported in Bangladesh  without CRF Certificate issued by the PSI Agencies.  As such, it is clear that the PSI Agents, including the  petitioners are providing necessary support to the  Government in implementation of its policy. To this    extent, the PSI Agencies, including the petitioners    have been carrying out feasibility studies, assisting    in implementation of project, providing advice to                   the Goverment to implement ils project to increase  the eficiency of the Customs Department and also  whieh is evi-  dent trom the responsibilities of the petitioners, 3  set out in Seetion 6 of the REP,    supervising by working With it close    ",
      "14. SRO No.189-Ain/2008/491-Mushok    defines \"Jarip Shangstha (Surveyor) and 'Consul-  tant’ as follows :   <br>   So quotation 'So 20 So. 20 00' denote ‘Jarip  Shangstha' and 'So © So ©2.00 denote consultan-  cy firm and supervisory firm. In SRO No.197-  Ain/2008/499-Mushok rate of VAT of those two  have been fixed at 15% for Surveyor and 4.5% for  the Consultant (Annexure-F series). He further sub-  mits that functions of the petitioners do not fall  within the functions carried out by a Surveyor. He  further submits that though SRO No.105-  Ain/2009/513-Mushok dated 11-6-2009 modified  the definition of \"Surveyor\" the Finance Act, 2009    made no change to the definition of \"Consultants\"  which remained as before.    ",
      "13. Further he submits that the scheme of the  VAT regime in respect of the 'Surveyors' and  ‘Consultants' i.e. the PSI Agents were set out in the  VAT Act and Rules and in particular in respect of  services in 3 SROs being (i) SRO No.189-Ain-  2008/49 1-Mushok, (ii) SRO No.193-Ain/2008/495-  Musak and (iii) SRO No.197-Ain/2008/499-  Mushak all dated 29-6-2008.    ",
      "12. Mr Fida M Kamal, Mr Akhter Imam, the  learned Senior Counsels and Mr Abdullah M Hasan,  the learned counsel appeared in all these writ peti-  tions. Mr Fida M Kamal, afer taking us in minute  details each and every Annexures with the petition  pinpointed the different aspects to show that under  the new scheme pursuant to advertisement                 (Annexure B-1) the services solicited by the respon-  dents from the petitioners were absolutely as that of  ‘Consultants’. That is to say the petitioners were  required only to render consultancy services as  ‘Consultants’ and not as ‘Surveyors’ but the petition-  ers became aggrieved when they found that the  respondents in utter disregard of VAT Act, and the  VAT Rules of 1991, deducted VAT from the peti-  tioners at the rate of 13.04% instead of 4.5% treat-  ing them as ‘Surveyors’. He further submits that the  \"Instruction to Applicants\" of the tender document  expressly provides that the petitioners are and would  be treated as 'Consultants'. Moreover, the petitioners  have been classified as 'Consultants' by Income Tax  Authority and they have been paying advance  income tax under section 52A of the Income Tax  Ordinance, 1984 as ‘Consultants’. To him it appears  that the respondents are treating the petitioners as  ‘Surveyors' only for collecting more revenue.  Further the petitioners were also given express rep-  resentation by the Government that they would be  ‘Consultants’. The petitioners were appointed  through QCBS method (which is only used for  selection of Consultants) and different wings of the  respondents i.e. Income Tax department, have clas-  sified the petitioners to be ‘Consultants’.    ",
      "11. At the very outset we think it would be nec-  essary to mention that after a long legal battle which  started from High Court Division and ended up in  the Appellate Division, it has been finally settled in  the case on National Board of Revenue Chairman vs  Intertek Testing Services International Ltd 1] BLC  (AD) 233 that the services rendered by PSI Agency  are vatable.    ",
      "10. The petitioners commenced work on Ist  October, 2008 immediately after entering into the  Contract. They rendered their invoices in accor-  dance with Contract. Thereafter the petitioners  received the impugned letters (Annexure A series)  and came to know that the respondents had wrongly  treated the petitioners as 'Surveyors' and deducted  VAT at the rate of 13.04% (on the gross amount of the  invoice) from the petitioners’ invoice submitted till  date. Though the petitioners by its letters dated 1-2-09  and 23-4-2009 requested the respondent to deduct  VAT at the rate of 4.5% to which the respondent paid  no heed thereto and in that stage the petitioners  moved this Division and obtained the present Rule.    ",
      "9. Be it mentioned the RFP forms an integral  rar of the Contract and it is apparent from the same  tat the petitioners were to provide consultancy  services. Section 6 of the RFP reads as follows :  <br>  \"2.4(c) PSI Company, at its own cost, shall  assist National Board of Revenue in its capaci-  ty building efforts through imparting training of  the officers of Customs on any customs related  matter. The subjects of training shall include,  inter alia, valuation, classification, post clear-  ance audit, prevention of commercial forgery  and fraud risk management, intelligence man-  agement etc. The training modules number and  kind of trainees and locations to be decided in  Consultation with National Board of Revenue.  However, number of trainees in any month shall  not be less than 10(ten) and at least two inspec-  tion programs of the PSI Company's overseas  Offices, with a duration of 7(seven) days each,  must be included in the modules.  <br>  2(d) PSI Company will assist National  Board of Revenue in developing a comprehen-  sive Valuation Database and Commodity  Database for HS Classification, profiling of  importers, strengthening the existing automa-  tion of customs processing as well as installa-  tion of new system to ensure transparency and    increase efficiency of the customs department.        PSI Company must share, free of charge, all of  its existing database resources, on customs  related issues, maintained by its officers in dif-  ferent countries as and when required by the  National Board of Revenue and deliver the  same in the formal asked for.  <br>  2(e) The PSI Company will support  National Board of Revenue in developing an  effective automation Risk Management System  in all customs stations. 2(h) Upon request from  exporters, PS] Company may provide informa-  tion on the existing enactments, rules, regula-  tions and standards followed in Bangladesh in  trade related matters.\"    ",
      "50. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The  impugned judgment and order dated 30-3-1997  passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge,  Pabna in Sessions Case No. 87 of 1993 is set aside  and the appellants Atahar, Mutahar, Sohrab,  Ishaque, Babu, Bellal and Abdul Karim alias Karim  are found not guilty of the charge levelled against  them and Atahar, Ishaque, Babu, Bellal and Abdul  Karim alias Karim be set at liberty forthwith if not  wanted in any other case and accused appellants  Mutahar and Sohrab be discharged from their  respective bail bond.    Send down the LCR at once.

      "48. The learned trial Court without considering  the evidence on record erroneously convicted the  accused appellant without observing any norms of  law.        ",
      "47. The learned trial Court without properly  serutinising the evidence on record convicted the  accused Atahar, Mutahar, Sohrab, Bellal, Ishaque,  Babu and Karim under sections 302/34 of the Penal  Code on surmise, conjecture and on emotion. Court  or Tribunal administering any judicial matter must  administer justice according to law and must not  allow itself to be influenced by emotion or personal  notion, however heinous the offence involved in the  case may be. A dispassionate and balanced approach  so the vital aspect of the case and the law bearing on  the subject is a precondition for administering even-  handed justice. Law, equity and good conscience  demand that justice should not only be done but it  must also be seen to have been done. The supreme  consideration for a Court of law is to do justice  between the parties In the instant case, the prosecu-  tion has hopelessly failed to prove its case beyond  all shadow of doubt.    ",
      "46. In our country a witness has a tendency to  exaggerate, embroider and to implicate someone  falsely out of grudge and enmity. Justice is a divine  function and the Court dispensing justice discharges  divine functions. The Court is to examine the entire  evidence carefully and must distinguish the chaff  from the grain. The entire evidence is to be tested,  scrutinised and assessed along with circumstances  in order to disengage the truth from falsehood. It is  not justified to convict a man merely on surmise and  conjecture. On a careful scrutiny of the evidence of  prosecution witnesses, it appears to us that the pros-  ecution evidence are full of discrepancies and incon-                   sistencies and these evidence are unworthy of ered-  it which strike at the root of the prosecution case and  have made the prosecution case doubtful.    ",
      "45. In the instant case, if we place defence ver-  sion and its supporting evidence and circumstances  and the prosecution case side by side in order to  arrive at a correct decision, it will appear to us that  the defence version of the case will come out promi-  nently in order to defeat the prosecution case but the  learned trial Court did not virtually consider the  defence version. If the defence put forward an alibi  on behalf of the accused which seems to be true, the  accused is entitled to a verdict of benefit of doubt.  There is a basic rule of criminal jurisprudence that if  two views are possible on the evidence adduced in a  case of circumstantial evidence, one pointing to the  guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence,  the Court should adopt the view favourable to the  accused. In the instant case, if we consider the  entire evidence we can safely conclude that the  Prosecution has totally failed to prove its case,  moreso, the version put forward by the defence has  a reasonable possibility of being true. Hence the  accused is entitled to get benefit of doubt not as a  matter of grace but as a matter of right.    ",
      "44. It is not possible to arrive at any conclu.  sion without assessing the entire evidence of both  sides. Court is to consider the evidence of prosecu-  tion witnesses along with all other evidence and cir-  cumstances appearing in the case and only then the  Court can be in a position to weigh the testimony  and probabilities with the requisite decree of thor-  oughness before reaching its conclusion.    ",
      "43. In the instant case, the defence has got sup-  port from the prosecution witnesses and from the  attending circumstances. Here in this case, PW 2  Helal and PW 6 Ekram Hossain are the only eye-  witnesses who accompanied the deceased Nazrul  Islam but Helal could not specify any accused who  assaulted deceased Nazrul Islam and Ekram also  could not recognise any accused. Thus the prosecu-  tion has totally failed to prove its case.    ",
      "42. In a criminal case the accuseds are not  required to set up their case in writing, such as a  written statement of the defendant of a civil suit, nor  are they required to give evidence to prove their  innocence, or even to establish their pleas, except a  special plea within the meaning of section 105 of the  Evidence Act and it is entirely for the prosecution to  establish the guilt of the accuseds. Defence case has  been made out by cross-examining the prosecution  witnesses and making suggestions and when  defence version gets support from the prosecution  witnesses and attending circumstances which may  be sufficient for their acquittal. Defence may put to  prosecution witness any suggestion they think prop-  er and the accused may take any pleas including  inconsistent pleas and for such inconsistent pleas,  the defence case will not be affected. Even if both  such pleas are rejected by Court as not established,  still he has a right to acquittal if the prosecution evi-  dence is not sufficient to prove his guilt beyond rea-  sonable doubt. Or if the accused may plead just not  guilty and remain silent all through. But nothing  adverse therefrom can be presumed against him.  Whether his pleas are established or not and whether  he leads evidence or not that is not material. The  cardinal principle of criminal justice that the  accused shall be presumed to be innocent until his  guilt is proved shall be followed at all stages of the  trial.    ",
      "41. It appears from the evidence on record that  the victim Nazrul Islam died at the last part of night  when it was dark. The recognition of the accused  Persons during last part of night is very much doubt-  ful, rather it is impossible. In this respect we may  further add here that the prosecution failed to come  with a lunar calendar to show that the night of occur-                 rence was moonlight night. So, the re-cognition of  the accused in such dark night is quite impossible.  We find supports of the above view in the case of  Annaddi alias Avenuddin vs State reported in 6 BLC  310.    ",
      "40. The learned trial Court found Kafiluddin  Biswas, Alam, Asadullah alias Asadul, Nawab alias  Nubir, Shahed Ali, Ashraf, Ibrahim, Khairul,  Sobhan, Rowashan, Abdul Jalil, Mohirul,  Owisuddin, Azimuddin alias Azim and Farid are  found not guilty under sections 302/34,325/34 of the  Penal Code. Thus we find that the learned trial  Court did not believe one part of the prosecution  case and believed the other part.    ",
      "39. PW 6 Ekram Hossain also could not identi-  fy any accused person as they were villagers of other  village.    ",
      "38. Scanning the evidence of prosecution wit-  nesses, it appears that PW 2 Helal and PW 6 Ekram  Hossain are the only eye-witnesses. PW 2, Helal,  could not identify any accused persons who assault-  ed the victim Nazrul Islam.    ",
      "37. In the cross-examination, the witnesses  deposed that they were taken to the house of  Kafiluddin Biswas and they were beaten there.  Ekram as PW 6 stoutly deposed that he could not  Tecognise any accused persons as they were the men  of other village. He denied the suggestion that he  has deposed falsely. If any witness tells the truth, he  should not be declared hostile. Though this witness  was declared hostile, there is no reason to disbelieve  the deposition of this witness.    ",
      "36. PW 6 Md Ekram Hossain like Helal  deposed that he, Nazrul Islam and Helal were sleep-  ing in the pump house and at about 1-00 PM he  woke up hearing the cry of victim Nazrul Islam; that  they were drivers of Nazrul Islam; that 8 to 10 peo-  ple entered into the pump house and others were  outside the room; that they tied the face of Nazrul    and Helal and brought them outside of the room;    that those persons brought them to the house of  Kafiluddin Biswas located at Hamchiapur; that they  told the other persons that thieves were brought on  road passing through by the side of the house of  Kafiluddin Biswas and the persons present started to  assault them; that he lost his sense; that Helal was  brought to the hospital where he stayed for two  days.    ",
      "35. In this case PW 2 Helal and PW 6 Ekram  are the only eye-witnesses and all other witnesses  heard of the occurrence from them. PW 2 Helal  deposed that he is the labourer of the informant who  narrated the case to the effect that two years ago on  27th Baishak at 1-00 PM, he, Ekram and Nazrul  were sleeping in the pump house at night; that hear-  ing cry of Nazrul Islam he woke up and saw that  20/30 men gheraoed the pump house who assaulted  them; that Nazrul Islam died at the time of Fazar  prayer. He deposed no where in his deposition as to  who assaulted Nazrul Islam by which he died. His  deposition also supported the defence plea that a  mob assaulted him for which he died.    ",
      "34. PW 3 Md Tasiruddin and PW 13 Abdul  Quashem are the seizure list witnesses. PW 12 Md  Ejibor Ali Shah is tendered, PW 7 Md Jewel Amin,  Sl of police who filled up the FIR Form. PW 14, Dr  Md Nuruzzaman was the medical officer, Pabna  who held the post mortem, PW 15 Abdul Baten  Shah is the investigating officer of this case.    ",
      "33. The prosecution has examined 15 witness-  es. PW 1 Md Akbar Ali who is the father of the  deceased Nazrul Islam, PW 2 Md Helal and PW 6  Ekram Hossain are eye-witnesses who accompanied  the victim Nazral Islam. PW 4 Seraj, PW 5 Belayet  Ali Sheikh, PW 8 Azmot Ali Sheikh are co-villagers  and PW 9, Abdul Quddus Khan is a village doctor,  PW 10 Fazlul Hoque and PW 11 Md Ansar Ali  Sheikh who went to the house of kafiluddin Biswas  of village Hamichapur and saw that Nazrul Islam is  dead and Helal and Ekram were injured.    ",
      "32. Now let us see whether the prosecution has  succeeded to prove that the accused persons killed  the victim Nazrul Islam,    ",
      "31. Moreover, it appears from the evidence of  PW 1 Akbar Ali that the fathers of the deceased  Nazrul Islam, Helal and Ekram were accuseds in the  murder case of Shafi member. The relatives of the  victim filed that case. Thus it appears that there was  previous enmity between the parties. Enmity cuts  both ways. It is the contention of the defence that  after stealing IRRI paddy by the deceased Nazrul  Islam and others and the victim Nazrul Islam was  beaten by the mob and taking this advantage, the  accused persons have been falsely implicated in this  case out of previous enmity and grudge. From the  testimonies of the PWs, it clearly reveals that they  made contradictory statements regarding place of  occurrence, time of occurrence and manner of  occurrence as a result of which the prosecution has  failed to prove time, place and manner of occurrence  beyond any shadow of doubt.                   ",
      "30. It appears from the evidence of eye-witness  Md Helal that 20/30 people attacked them and there-  afier 50/60 people assembled there. PW 9 Abdul  Quddus Khan deposed that 200/300 people gathered  there. The evidence of prosecution supports the  defence version that Nazrul Islam, Helal and Ekram  might have stolen IRRI paddy for which the mob  beat them as a result of which the victim Nazrul  Islam had died, The above facts and evidence plain-    ly disclose that the occurrence took place over steal.    ing of IRRI paddy for which many people assaulted    Nazrul Islam, Helal and Ekram as thieves. It gener.    ally happens in our country that when the thieves are    caught they are given public beating. Such incidents    are not uncommon in our country, particularly in the  village area. It is not uncommon to see that when a  person is apprehended on the allegation of theft or  other offence passions run high and people who  gather round the unfortunate person try to give a fist  and blow often forgetting that they themselves are  indulging in an act which is culpable and may even  cost the life of the victim. Such thing has happened  in the present case. In such circumstances, it is very  difficult to assess the liability of the accuseds. All  these facts go to show that the learned trial Court  clearly failed to ascertain the cause of the death of  deceased Nazrul Islam. From the above evidence, it  is at least capable of creating doubt whether the  accuseds were there at the time of happening or  whether they assaulted victim Nazrul Islam and, in  such circumstances, the accused persons are entitled  to get benefit of doubt because the defence alibi has  got support by the evidence of the prosecution. The  defence plea is reasonably probable to us.    ",
      "29. The prosecution stated in the FIR that the  accused persons assaulted Nazrul Islam, Helal and  Ekram taking a false plea of stealing IRRI paddy.    ",
      "28. The pertinent question for consideration in  this appeal is, the manner of occurrence. Though  motive is not the important factor for consideration,  still it rings our mind that why would the accuseds  suddenly attack the victim Nazrul Islam and others,  we find no reason of such attack.    ",
      "27. PW 9, Abdul Quddus deposed that the  occurrence took place in the early morning when it  was a bit dark. Thus we also find divergent evi-  dence as regard the time of occurrence which casts  doubt lin the prosecution case.    ",
      "26. The time of occurrence was shown in the  FIR Form at 1-00 PM dated 11-5-1992 . In the  charge sheet, it is stated that the accused persons  brought out Nazrul Islam from the shed of deep  tubewell at 1-00 PM and assaulted him mercilessly  whereby he died, PW 1, Ali Akbar, testified that  occurrence took place at night following 11-5-1992.    ",
      "25. In the FIR Form, the place of occurrence  was shown at Pargobindapur under Neyamotpur  mouza and in the body of FIR, the place of occur-  rence was shown in the house of Kafiluddin under  mouza Hamchapur which is 3(three) miles away                 from Pargobindapur. PW 9, Abdul Quddus Khan  was called for treatment of victim Nazrul Islam who.  found the dead body of Nazrul Islam by the side of  road which was out side the house of Kafiluddin  Biswas. Supporting PW 9, PW 4, Seraj also  deposed that Nazral Islam was not found in the  courtyard of Kafiluddin Biswas and the dead body  of Nazrul Islam was found by the side of road. Thus  we find divergent evidence as regard the place of  occurrence and as a matter of fact, the place of  occurrence has been shifted which has seriously  prejudiced the prosecution case,    ",
      "24. Now let us see how far the prosecution has  succeeded in proving the case and how far evidence  of PWs inspire the confidence of the Court.    First of all, we like to scan the evidence of pros-  ecution as regard the place of occurrence, time of  occurrence and manner of occurrence. We find seri-  ous contradictions in the evidence on record.    ",
      "23. Where the accused raises the plea of alibi  burden lies on him to substantiate that fact at least to  the extent of a reasonable probability. Even if the  evidence produced is capable of creating a doubt  whether the accuseds took part in the occurrence  then the accuseds are entitled to benefit of doubt.    ",
      "22. In a criminal trial, the burden of proving  the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable  doubts always rests on the Prosecution and on its  failure, it cannot fall back upon the evidence  adduced by the accused in support of his defence to  rest its case solely thereon. In Criminal cases, it is  for the prosecution to bring the guilt home to the  accused.    ",
      "21. The fundamental and basic presumption in  the administration of Criminal Law and justice  delivery system is the innocence of the alleged  accuseds and till the charges are proved beyond rea-  sonable doubt on the basis of clear, cogent, credible  or unimpeachable evidence, the question of punish-  ing the accuseds does not arise.    ",
      "20. The allegations against the accused appel-  lants have no legal value unless these are substanti-  ated by cogent and reliable evidence.    ",
      "19. On the other hand, defence totally denies  such allegation stating that due to stealing of paddy  the mob assembled at the place of occurrence who  might have assaulted the victim Nazrul Islam and  others.    ",
      "18. The allegation against the accused appel-  lants is that in the night on 10-5-1992 while the  deceased Nazrul Islam along with Helal and Ekram  were guarding deep tubewell, the accused persons  took them to the house of Kafiluddin and assaulted  them on the plea of stealing IRRI paddy and that  because of such assault Nazrul Islam succumbed to  his injuries.     ",
      "17. To appreciate the legality and impropriety  of the impugned judgment, it is necessary to scruti-  nise the law and evidence relating to the facts of the  case,    ",
      "16. The only point for determination in the  appeal is, whether the learned Additional Sessions  Judge, Pabna is justified in convicting and sentenc-  ing the accuseds appellants under sections 302/34 of  the Penal Code.    ",
      "15. Mr Rabiul Ahsan Habib, the learned  Assistant Attorney-General for the State, opposes  the appeal and submits that the prosecution proved  its case against the appellants by most consistent,  corroborative and overwhelming evidence of com-  petent witnesses. He further submits that the  leamed Additional Sessions Judge, Pabna was per-  fectly justified in convicting and sentencing the  appellants on the basis of cogent and reliable evi-  dence and his judgment does not suffer from any  mis-reading and non-reading of evidence. The  leamed Assistant Attorney-General further submits  that all the prosecution witnesses are natural, proba-  ble and competent witnesses and there is no internal  points of falsehood in their evidence on any point  and, as such, the impugned judgment calls for no  interference by this Court.    ",
      "14. The learned Advocate for the appellant  cited the decisions in the case of Abdul Gafur vs  State reported in 1992 BLD (AD) 90, in the case of  Annadi alias Avenuddin vs State reported in 6 BLC  310, in the case of Shah Alam ys State reported in  42 DLR (AD) 31 and in the case of Mahiruddin vs  State reported in 1986 BLD (AD) 318 in support of  his contention,    ",
      "13. Mr JBM Hasan, the learned Advocate for  the appellants, took us through the FIR, charge  sheet, charge so framed, the deposition of the prose-  cution witnesses, impugned judgment and material  papers included in the paper book and submits that  the investigation of the case was held in a perfunc-  tory way which prejudiced the defence; that the  charges framed against the accused appellants were  vague, ambiguous and non speaking allegations  seriously prejudicing the accused appellants in  defence of their cases; that in the examination of the  accused appellants under section 342 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure, they were afforded with no  information as to the circumstances and accusation  which they were to explain, resulting in an illegality  vitiating the entire trial; that no independent and dis-  interested eye-witness deposed in the case and even  there is no unbroken chain of circumstances Proving  the case beyond all reasonable doubts and that there  being no independent and disinterested eye-witness-  es in support of the prosecution case. It is further  stated that the learned Additional Sessions Judge  ought to have held that for non-examination of inde-  pendent and disinterested charge sheeted witnesses  a presumption under section 114(g) of the Evidence  Act be applicable and had those witnesses been  examined, it is possible that a different case would  have come out; that the learned Additional Sessions  Judge on surmise and conjecture and without appre-  ciating the evidence on record in their true perspec-  tive arrived at a decision occasioning failure of jus-  tice.                   ",
      "12. The accused appellants being aggrieved by  and dissatisfied with the conviction under sections  302/34 of the Penal Code have come up with the  present appeal which is opposed by the respondent  State.    ",
      "11. Thereafter, in considering the evidence on  record as well as the facts and circumstances of the  case, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Pabna  found the accuseds Atahar, Motahar, Bellal,  Ishaque, Babu and Karim guilty under sections  302/34 of the Penal Code and convicted each of  them thereunder and sentencing each of them to suf-  fer rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine  of Taka 5000 in default to suffer rigorous imprison-  ment for 3(three) months more and the learned  Additional Sessions Judge, Pabna found the    accuseds Kafiluddin Biswas, Asadullah alias  Asadul, Nawan alias Nubir, Sahed Ali, Ashraf,  Ibrahim, Khairul, Sobhan, Rowshan, Abdul Jalil,  Mohirul, Owisuddin, Azimuddin alias Azim, and  Fariduddin not guilty under sections 302/34 of the  Penal Code and acquitted them thereunder.    ",
      "10. The further defence case is that the  deceased Nazrul Islam, Helal and Ekram might have  stolen the IRRI paddy for which the mob assaulted  them for which deceased Nazrul Islam might have  died.    ",
      "9. The defence case as could be gathered  from the trend of cross-examination is the total  denial and their case, inter alia, is that the accuseds  are innocent and they have been falsely implicated  in this case out of enmity and personal grudge.    ",
      "8. After closure of the prosecution witnesses,  the accused persons were examined under section  342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which  they repeated their innocence and the defence did  not adduce any evidence on their behalf.    ",
      "7. The prosecution has examined 15 witness-  es who were cross-examined by the defence and the  defence examined none.    ",
      "6. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,  Pabna on the basis of material available on record  framed charge against the accused persons under  sections 302/34/325/34 of the Penal Code and read  it over to them in open Court and they pleaded not  guilty and demanded for trial.    ",
      "5. Afler filing of the charge sheet against the  accuseds, the case record was sent to the learned  Sessions Judge, Pabna who transferred the same to  the Additional Sessions Judge, Pabna for trial.    ",
      "4. Afier filing of the case, Police took up  investigation, visited the place of occurrence, seized  alamat as per seizure list, prepared sketch map with  separate index of the place of occurrence, examined  the witnesses and recorded their statements under  section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and  thereafter submitted charge sheet against the  accuseds being No. 182 dated 12-8-1992 under sec-                   tions 364/342/302/325/323/34 of the Penal Code  against all the FIR-named_ accused persons.    ",
      "3. The prosecution case, in brief, is that on  10-5-1992 night following Sunday informant's son  Nazrul Islam, Helal, son of Seraj and Ekram, son of  Nazumuddin, of village Gobindapur while patrol-  ling the deep tubewell commissioned for irrigation  of the 'IRRI' crops, then the accused Atahar,  Mutahar, Sohrab, Bellal, Ishaque, Babu, Farid,  Asadullah, Nabah, Waz Ali Biswas, Mohirul  Biswas, A Jalil, Azimuddin, Asrab, Abdul Karim,  Sabed Ali, Sobhan, Khairul, Shafiqur Rahman  (Shafi), Ibrahim, Rawsan Ali, Kafiluddin Biswas  and Alam caught hold of informant's son Nazrul  Islam and his labourers Helal and Ekram by the  order of Kafiluddin Biswas and carried them over to  the house of Kafiluddin Biswas and that the  accuseds tied Nazrul Islam and two others on a false  allegation of theft of Irri paddy and started beating  them mercilessly at which they raised hue and cry  whereupon witness Ajai, Ansar and Fazlur Rahman  came to the house of the informant, It is further stat-  ed that the informant along with his sons, relations,  Hashem member and Habibur Rahman came to the  house of Kafiluddin Biswas and found that his son  Nazrul Islam was murdered and Helal and Ekram  lying wounded; and that the informant and his com-  panion asked Helal and Ekram about the incident at  which they narrated the story that the accuseds all  ona sudden at night of 10-5-1992 entered into deep  tubewell house, tied them up and carrying them  through field by giving serious beating whereupon.  Nazrul died on the way. It is further stated that  about 10/12 years back son of Kafiluddin Biswas  was murdered and in that case the informant was an  accused wherefore Kafiluddin Biswas committed  the instant occurrence in taking revenge of that  case.    ",
      "2. One Akbar Ali Sheikh, father of deceased  Nazrul Islam, lodged a first information report on  11-5-1992 with Pabna Police Station being No.  9(5)92 under sections 364/342/325/302/34 of the  Penal Code against the accused appellants and 16  others,    ",
      "1. Defence plea—There is a basic rule of crimi-  nal jurisprudence that if two views are possible  on the evidence adduced in a case of circumstan-  tial evidence, one pointing to the guilt of the  accused and the other to his innocence, the Court  should adopt the view favourable to the accused.  If we consider the entire evidence we can safely  conclude that the prosecution has totally failed to  Prove its case, moreso, the version put forward  by the defence has a reasonable possibility of  being true. Hence the accused is entitled to get  benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace but as a  matter of right.   <br>               In the instant case, if we place defence version and its  supporting evidence and circumstances and the prosecu-  tion case side by side in order to arrive at a correct deci-  sion, it will appear to us that the defence version of the  case will come out prominently in order to defeat the pros-  ecution case but the learned trial Court did not virtually  consider the defence version. If the defence put forward  an alibi on behalf of the accused which seems to be true,  the accused is entitled to a verdict of benefit of doubt.  45)    Abdul Gafur vs State 1992 BLD (AD) 90; Annadi  alias Ayenuddin vs State 6 BLC 310; Shah Alam vs State  42 DLR (AD) 31 and Mahiruddin vs State 1986 BLD  (AD) 318 ref.  <br>  JBM Hassan with NA Chisty, Advocates—For the  Appellants.  <br>  Rabiul Ahsan Habib, Assistant Attorney-General—  For the State Respondent.  <br>  Judgment  <br>  Siddiqur Rahman Mith J: This appeal at the  instance of Atahar and others under section 410 of  the Code of Criminal Procedure is directed against  the judgment and order dated 30-3-1997 passed by  the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Pabna in  Sessions Case No. 87 of 1993 arising out of Pabna  PS Case No. 9(5)92 corresponding to GR Case No.  130 of 1992 convicting the accused appellants under  sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentencing  them thereunder to suffer rigorous imprisonment for  life and also to pay a fine of Taka 5,000 (five thou-  sand) each and in default to suffer rigorous impris-  onment for 3(three) months more.

      "20. In the result the Rule is made absolute and  the impugned judgment and order of conviction and    sentenced dated 14-1-2007 passed by Special  Tribunal Judge, Special Tribunal No, 4, Dinajpur in  Special Tribunal Case No, 289 of 2003 arising out of  Kotwali Police Station Case No. 23 dated 14-10.  2002 corresponding to GR No. 482 of 2002 convict.  ing the petitioner under section 19A of the Arms  Act, 1878 and sentencing him to suffer rigorous  imprisonment for 14 (fourteen) years is hereby  quashed. The convict petitioner should be set at lib-  erty immediately, unless his detention is required in  connection with any other case.    ",
      "19. In view of the findings recorded above, we  are of the view that the impugned judgment and    order is based on no evidence, accordingly we find  merit in this rule.    ",
      "18. We have also noticed that, in the first infor-  mation report it has been narrated that the gun was  stolen from a village named Naiter on 4-6-2002,  PW 10 and PW 12 in their deposition also stated that  the gun in question was stolen from the village  Naiter, but the informant while deposed as PW 1 tes-  tified that the gun in question was taken away by the  accused while committing dacoity at the village of  Naiter. If the gun was either stolen or looted while  committed dacoity by the accused, as alleged by the  prosecution, then there must be an owner and  claimant to whom belong the gun and the seized gun  should have been delivered to the person who is  entitled to the legal possession thereof after conclu-  sion of the trial as per provision of section 517 of the  Code, but the act of forfeiting the gun in this case,  cast a doubt on the prosecution case as to how the  gun has come into the possession of the accused.  This does not expel the possibility of a planted case,  considered in the context of the prosecution case  itself.    ",
      "17. PWS, inhis deposition, described the place  from where the gun has been allegedly recovered as  follows:   <br>               Hence we find that there is no evidence to show  that the arms in question was recovered from the  exclusive possession or control of the accused as  alleged by the prosecution. The principle of law laid  down in 50 DLR 356 is applicable in the facts and  circumstances of this case. It has been held in that  case that, the place of recovery being a public place  it cannot be said that the appellant was in exclusive  possession of that place. That being so, the appel-  lant cannot be held liable under section 19A of the  Amns Act.    ",
      "16. We, therefore, are constrained to hold that  the evidence as regards the recovery of the gun is  inconsistent and the prosecution has failed to prove  the fact of recovery of the gun by any consistent,  cogent and unimpeachable evidence. As such the  evidence relied on to prove the fact of recovery of  the gun is no evidence in the eye of law.    ",
      "15. Adverting to the deposition of the PW | we  find that PW 1 deposed that he himself, by his own  hands recovered the gun, the barrel and the butt of  the gun kept separately, wrapped up in a polyethyl-  ene paper and tied up by a rope, from the said bam-  boo clump of Krishna Master of village Barail.  During cross-examination he further deposed that  the gun was not taken out by the accused and that it  was covered by leaves. On the other hand, PW 5,  who is the seizure list No. 4, during his cross-exam-  ination deposed that “SFT FS Bue Fst ca era  GR Tyeit anit fica wren fer) SPA fre ace aS  afsca Tyee Ca FCA CA 1” On the other hand, PW 6,  seizure list witness No. 1, deposed that, “ator 72051  aqets aaafrerca tet wees fa 1” As such we find  clear and vital contradictions as to the manner of  tecovery of the gun and that cast serious doubt as to  the fact of the recovery of the gun.    ",
      "14. Now to arrive at the conclusion as to  whether this is a case of no evidence we have  assessed for ourselves the deposition of the witness-  es mentioned above as well as other materials on  record and also heard the learned advocates repre-  senting the petitioner as well as the state.    ",
      "13. PW 1 Md Jamiruddin, Sub-Inspector of  Police and the informant during his examination in  chief deposed that, having received the secret infor-  mation he along with the members of his force sur-  rounded the house of the brother of the accused, at  village Barail under PS Kotwali on 13-10-2002  about 10-15 AM and they have apprehended the  accused from the house of his brother Abdur Rashid.  When interrogated the accused informed the police  that he has taken away an one barrel gua while com-  mitting dacoity at a village named Naiter (under the  same police station) and that he has kept the said  gun under the bamboo clump of one Kirshno Master  of village Barail. He went to the said bamboo clump  taking the accused along with some other people  and he himself, by his own hands, recovered the said  gun, etc barrel and butt kept separately inside a  polyethylene paper tied with rope, as shown by the  accused. The witnesses has seen the act of recovery  of the gun and that he prepared a seizure list at the  place of occurrence at about 11-45 AM and obtained  signature of the seizure list witnesses. He has                   proved the gun, the polyethylene and the rope which  were marked as material exhibits 1, Hand TL. He  then proceeded towards the police station and  lodged the ejahar in writing on the following day at  about 1-30 PM. The first information report was  recorded by the OC Shahid Shokrana, which was  registered as Kotwali PS 23/447 from which arose  the GR Case No. 482 of 2002.He has also proved  the seizure list and his signature thereon respective-  ly marked as Exhibit 1 and 1/A. He has also proved  the first information report and his signature thereon  marked as Exhibit 2 and 2/A. He has also proved  the first information report form and the signature of  the Officer-in-charge, which were marked as exhib-  it 3 and 3/A. PW No. | however, could not say the  direction at which the bamboo clump was situated  from the house of Krishna Master. He further stat-  ed that he did not mention name of the seizure list  witnesses in the first information report.    PW 2 Md Nazrul Islam, a police constable, dur-  ing cross-examination, stated that he was present at  the time of apprehending the accused and recovery  of the gun. PW 3 Md Salim Hossen, police consta-  ble, during his cross-examination by the accused,  stated that he was present at the time of apprehend-  ing the accused on 13-10-2002 and recovery of the  gun, PW 4 Belal Hossen, a police constable, were  tendered by the prosecution. During cross-examina-  tion, he deposed that he avas present at the time of  apprehending the accused and recovery of the arms  on 13-10-2002.    PW 5 Makbul Hossen, a police constable and a  seizure list witnesses, He deposed during examina-  tion in chief that he went to the place of occurrence  along with the informant and that the arms was  recovered from the bamboo clump of one Krishna  Master at the showing of the accused and that the  seizure list witnesses has signed on the seizure list at  the place of occurrence. During cross-examination  this PW 5 disposed that—   <br> The PW 6 Md Abdur Rahim, the seizure tig,  witness No. 1, during his examination in chief stat.  ed that on 13-10-1999 at about 11-30 PM he went to  the police station and the police took him to the vil-  lage Barail and that the police went to the bamboo  clump along with him from which a gun was recoy-  ered and thereafter he signed the seizure list after  coming to the police station. During cross-examj-  nation this PW 6 deposed that —        PW 7 Sree Mohendra Chandra Roy was also  tendered. During cross-examination he states that  he lives about one kilometer far from the place of  occurrence and there were about 42-50 houses situ-  ated near by the place of occurrence and the bamboo  clump is used as latrine by the local people.        PW 8 Md Fazlul Haque and PW 9 Md Abdul  Rashid, a Sub-Inspector of Police were also ten-  dered by the prosecution.    PW 10 Md Sabujer Rahman, a constable of  police and a member of RAB-5 Rajshahi, during his  examination in chief deposes that he went to the  place of occurrence along with the officer-in-charge.  The officer-in-charge interrogated the accused about  the gun stolen from the village Naitor and the  accused informed that the gun has been kept in the  bamboo clump Krishna Master. Thereafter this PW,  the officer-in-charge and the other members of the  force, at the showing of the accused, one single bar-  tel gun was recovered. Thereafter the said gun was  seized, seizure list was prepared and the  Investigation Officer filed a case after coming to the  police station.  <br>  PW 11 Md Abul Hashem, a police constable.  during his examination in chief deposed that, they  have raided the house of the brother of the accused,  found the accused there and apprehended the  accused and he was interrogated there, when the  accused admitted the fact of concealing arms in a  bamboo clump and he was taken by the police force  to the bamboo clump of Krishna Master wherefrom                 the gun was recovered. The Investigation Officer  prepared the seizure list, obtained signature of the  witnesses and retumed to police station along with  the accused and filed a case against him.    PW 12 Md Asraffuzzaman, a police constable,  during his examination in chief deposed that he  went to the village Barail along with the officer-in-  charge and the informant SI Jamir and apprehended  the accused on 13-10-2002 . The accused was inter  informed that a gun stolen from the village Naitor in  has been concealed by him in the bamboo clump of  one Krishna Master. Thereafter the police force  went to the said bamboo clump along with the  sccused and that the accused himself taken out the  ams from the bamboo clump wrapped up in poly-  ethylene sheet and kept inside the bamboo clump.  Thereafter the arms was seized and signature of the  seizure list witnesses were taken and they came  back to Thana along with the accused. The accused  being absconded this PW_ was not cross-examined.    PW 13 Sree Ananda Mohon, during his exami-  nation in chief deposes that on 13-10-2002 police  apprehended him while he was going to home and  took him to the bamboo clump of Krishna Master  and recovered a gun from the bamboo clump and  obtained his signature on the seizure list. The  accused being absconded this PW was not cross-  examined.  <br>  PW 14 Md Abdur Rahman, Sub-Inspector of  police and investigation officer (10) during his  examination in chief deposed that based on the first  information report lodged by the informant, the offi-  cer-in-charge Shahid Shokrana has filed up the first  information report form on 14-10-2002 he has  proved his signature on the first information report  as Exhibit 2/B.

He had examined the said articles  and deposed that the gun recovered wa: ed by  the informant and that in the course of his investiga-  tion he, having found a prima facie case, has sub-  mitted a charge sheet dated 1-10-2003 . This PW  was not cross-examined by the defence, since  absconded.    ",
      "12. To arrive at the conclusion we have consid-  ered for our selves the evidence on record, the peti-  tion filed under section 561A of the Code and heard  the learned advocate for both sides.    ",
      "11. The points for determination in this case is  whether the impugned judgment and order is based  on no evidence and as to whether the same is liable  to be quashed.    ",
      "10. Ms Yeasmin Begum Bithi, the learned  Assistant Attorney-General representing the state  submits that there are adequate, cogent and reliable  evidence on record based on which the impugned  judgment and order has been passed and, as such,  this is not a case of no evidence, hence interference  by this honorable Court under section 561A of the  Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code) is not called  for.    ",
      "9. Learned Advocate Ms Nusrat Jahan repre-  senting the convict petitioner, took us through the  first information report as well as the evidence  adduced by the parties and then submits that the  arms in question has not been recovered from the  exclusive possession or control of the convict peti-  tioner inasmuch as admittedly the arms in question  was recovered from a bamboo clump of one Krishna  Kanta which is an open place anybody having  access to the same. She next submits that there are  contradictions in the deposition of the prosecution  witnesses as regards the recovery of the arms and as    such, the very fact of alleged recovery of the arms is  doubtful and is not based on any cogent or consis-  tent evidence. Finally, referring to some other con-  tradictions she submits that the prosecution has mis-  erably failed to prove the case against this accused  beyond reasonable doubt and, as such, there is no    evidence on record to connect the accused with or to  find him guilty in respect of the charge brought  against him. Hence, the impugned judgment is  liable to be quashed and the accused be acquitted.    ",
      "8. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and  order the convict has filed this petition under 561A  and obtained the instant rule as because the statuary  time limited for preferring an appeal has expired.    ",
      "7. The learned trial Court, whereupon, having  heard the learned advocates representing the parties  as well as having considered the evidence on record  have found the accused guilty of the charges brought  against him and passed the impugned judgment and  order convicting and sentencing him as mentioned  above.    ",
      "6. After close of the prosecution case the  Jeamed trial Court has examined the accused under  section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when  he was asked as to whether he pleads guilty, upon  bringing all incriminating facts and materials that  was adduced in the course of trial evidence, but the  accused pleaded not guilty. However, the defence  did not adduce any evidence either.    ",
      "5. That the prosecution adduced 14 witnesses.  to prove its case, while the defence examined none.  However from the cross examination of the defence,  the defence case appears to be that the arms in ques-  tion was not recovered from the exclusive posses-                 sion or control of the accused-petitioner inasmuch  as the same was recovered from the bamboo clump  which is an open and public place and that the fact  of alleged seizure of the arms has not been proved  by any cogent or consistent evidence and, as such,  the fact of recovery is doubtful,    ",
      "4. Thereafter the case being ready for trial the  same was transferred to the Court of Special Tri-  bunal No. 1, Dinajpur, for trial, wherein it has been  registered as Special Tribunal Case No. 289 of 2003.  Subsequently the case has been transferred to the  Court of Special Tribunal No. 4 Dinajpur, for trial  and the learned trial Court framed charge against the  convict petitioner under section 19A of the Arms  Act, 1878 (the Act), by an order dated 17-1-2004  and the charge was explained to the accused to  which he has pleaded not guilty and claimed to be  tried under the law,    ",
      "3. Thereafter the police duly investigated into  the case and having found a prima facie case sub-  mitted charge sheet No. 403 dated 1-10-2003 under  section 19A of the Arms Act, 1878 against the con-  vict petitioner.    ",
      "2. The prosecution case, as has been initiated  upon lodging a first information report (FIR) on 14-  10-2002 by the informant PW 1 Md Jamiruddin, as  Sub-Inspector of Police, briefly is that, on 13-10-  2002 at about 10-05 PM the officer in charge of  Kotwali Thana received an information through a  secret source that Md Abdus Sattar, suspected  accused of Kotwali PS Case No. 21 dated 9-6-2002   <br> *Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 15398 of 2007. <br>   and Kotwali PS Case No. 8 dated 5-6-2002, went  into hide in his residence or in the residence of his  brother Rashid situated at village Barail, PS  Kotwali, District Dinajpur, Having received the  secret information, the informant along with other  police personnel rushed towards the place of occur-  rence. At about 10-25 PM they had searched the  house of the accused's brother and arrested the  accused Abdus Sattar. On interrogation he con-  fessed that on 4-6-2002, he along with 8/10 persons,  had stolen gun (44) from village Naiter under the  same Police Station. The gun was kept hidden in the  bamboo clump of one Krishna Master. Accordingly,  the informant along with other police personnel  rushed towards the said bamboo clump. Thereafter,  in presence of the witnesses they recovered the  alleged gun at the showing of the accused. The gun  was kept inside a white polyethylene bag wrapped  up in a sky blue colour polyethylene, tied by jute  made string, barrel and butt of the gun were found  disintegrated.    ",
      "1. The place of recovery being a public place it  cannot be said that the appellant was in exclusive  possession of that place. The appellant cannot be  held liable under section 19A of the Arms Act.    Nusrat Jahan, Advocate—For the Petitioner.

      "104. The learned Counsel for the respondent  No.1 Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury prays for filing a  certificate appeal to the Appellate Division on the  ground that the case involves a substantial question  of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.  The prayer is opposed by the learned Counsel for  the petitioner Mr Asaduzzaman.    The substantial question of law raised in this  case as to the interpretation of the Constitution has  already been settled by the Appellate Division in  Masdar Hossain’s case and the decision rendered in  that case is being implemented till dated and the  Appellate Division is still in seisin of the matter.    | Consequently, the prayer for certificate is rejected.

      "103. Let the record be put up on 25-5-2010 for  passing necessary orders.    ",
      "102. Having regard to the discussions made  above and in the facts and circumstances of the case,  the Rule is made absolute in modified from without  any order as to costs, The impugned Warrant of  1986 (Annexure-'A' to the Writ  Petition) is declared to be without lawful authority  and of no legal effect. The respondent No.1 is direct-  ed to make a new Warrant of Precedence in accor-  dance with the 8(cight) point directives mentioned  in the body of the judgment within a period of 60  (sixty) days from the date of receipt of a copy there-  of and to place the District Judges, Members of the  judicial Service holding equivalent judicial pots of  the District Judges, Additional District Judges,  Chief Judicial Magistrates and Chief Metropolitan  Magistrates in appropriate places in the Table of the  new Warrant of Precedence. The respondent No.1 is  further directed to submit an  Affidavit-of-  Compliance along with a copy of the new Warrant  of Precedence in this Court by 13-5-2010 without  fail.    Precedence,    ",
      "101. The directives are as follows :  <br>  (1) As the Constitution is the supreme law  of the land, all constitutional office-  holders are to be placed first in order  of priority in the Table of the new  Warrant of Precedence;  <br>  2) Thereafier the constitutionally recog-  nized and referred post-holders, name-  ly, District Judges and Chiefs of Staff  of the Defence Services of Bangladesh  etc. are to be paced in the said Table;  albeit they are persons in the service of  the Republic;  <br>  (3) Members of the Judicial Service hold-  ing equivalent judicial posts of District at the same serial number of the Table:  <br>  (4)Since as per Article 152(1) of the  Constitution, District Judge includes  Additional District Judge, Additional  District Judges are to be placed at the  serial number immediately after that of  District Judges;  <br>  (5)As the Chief Judicial Magistrates and  the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates are  Judicial Officers of the rank and status  of Additional District. Judges. the  Chief Judicial Magistrates and the  Chief Metropolitan Magistrates are to  be paced at the same serial number  along with additional District Judges  in the Table; <br>   (6)As we have found that Judges are on a  par with political executives and legis-  lators and above administrative and  defence executives, District Judges,  Members of the Judicial Service hold-  ing equivalent judicial posts of District  Judges, Additional District Judges,  Chief Judicial Magistrates and Chier  Metropolitan Magistrates are to be  paced above the Chiefs of Staff of the  Defence Services of Bangladesh in the  Table;  <br>  (7)Public functionaries including Secre-  taries to the Government of Bangla-  desh are to be paced in order of priori-  ty in the Table after the placement of  the Chiefs of Staff of the Defence  Services of Bangladesh; and  <br>  (8)District. Judges, Members of the  Judicial Service holding equivalent  judicial posts of District Judges, addi-  tional District Judges, Chief Judicial  Magistrates and Chief Metropolitan  Magistrates are to be paced at appr                 private serial numbers in the Table of  the new Warrant of Precedence with-  out any fetters/restrictions like \"within  their respective charges” etc.    ",
      "100. However, we deem it prudent to formulate  a set of directives for making a new Warrant of  Precedence in the light of our observations and find-  ings made above.    ",
      "99. In view of the foregoing discussions and in  the facts and circumstances of the case, we find that  although the impugned Warrant of Precedence is a  policy decision of the Government, but the same is  based on utter irrationality, unreasonableness, arbi-  trariness, absurdity, whimsicality and preposterous-  ness. Such being the position, it is struck down as  being ultra vires the Constitution.    ",
      "98. Article 31 of the Constitution contemplates  that to enjoy the protection of the law, and to be  treated in accordance with law, and only in accor-  dance with law, is the inalienable right of every cit-  izen, whether he may be, and of every other person  for the time being within Bangladesh, and in partic-  ular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body.  reputation or property of any person shall be taken  except in accordance with law. It is the declared law  of the Appellate Division in Masdar Hossain’s case  that Judges, at whatever level they may be, are on a                 par with political executives and legislators and  above administrative executives. Ina word, the status  of the Judges has been finally and conclusively  decided in Masdar Hossain's case. In such a posture  of things, District Judges have the inalienable right  to be treated in accordance with the above law  declared by the Appellate Division, So they hav  legal right to pray for issuance of a Writ of man-  damus and the respondent No.1 has a legal duty to  comply therewith by placing the District Judges  appropriately in the Table of the Warrant of  Precedence as per the dictates of the law clearly  enunciated in Masdar Hossain's case by he  Appellate Division.    ",
      "97. It is in the impugned Warrant of Prece-  dence that it was made as per the directive of the  President in 1986 . At that time, the country was  under the presidential form of Government and as  such the President was the Chief Executive of the  country. But now in parliamentary dispensation, the  Prime Minister is the Chief Executive. In this con-  nection, Article 48(3) of the Constitution may be  adverted to. Article 48(3) provides that in the exer-  cise of all his functions, save only that of appointing  the Prime Minister pursuant to clause (3) of Article  56 and the Chief Justice pursuant to clause (1) of  Article 95, the President shall act in accordance with  the advice of the Prime Minister. So if any revision  of the impugned Warrant of Precedence is required  or if a question arises as to framing of a new Warrant  of Precedence altogether, then the Prime Minster  will have the final say on the matter subject to any  directions, observations and findings given by the  Court in this case.    ",
      "96. The District Judges will have precedence  with fetters like \"within their respective charges\" as  mentioned at serial No.24 in the Table; but at the  self-same serial No.24, officers of the rank of  Lieutenant Colonel in the Army and equivalent in  the Navy and Air Force and Commandant, Marine  Academy have been placed without any such fetters,    albeit their posts are localized. Besides, Professors  of Medical and Engineering Colleges have been  placed at serial No.23 without any fetters. despite    the localized nature of their functions and responsi-  bilities. We do not find reason or logic to fetter the  precedence of the District Judges within their  respective charges in a unitary state as ours  Anyway, in the Warrant of Precedence of even a fed-  eral state like Pakistan, District Judges have been  placed at serial No.27 without any fetters like-'with-  in their respective charges’ and they enjoy prece-  dence throughout the length and breadth of Pakistan.    ",
      "95. Judges of the High Court Division have  been placed at serior No. 9, though District Judges  have been placed at serial No. 24 in the Table of the  impugned Warrant of Precedence. But when a  District Judge is appointed a Judge of the High  Court Division under Article 95(1) of the Constitu-  tion, he makes a quantum leap from serial No.24 to  serial No.9, The non-placement of the District  Judges at a serial number in close proximity to that  of the Judges of the High Court Division in absolute  disregard of the constitutionally recognized poten-  tial of upward mobility is really astounding.    ",
      "94. From a combined reading of all the shades  of meaning of the word 'precedence' provided in the  above mentioned three dictionaries, it appears to us  that ‘precedence’ means priority and that priority is  necessarily and essentially predicated upon one's  status. The meaning of 'status' as given in the said  Black's Law Dictionary is a person's legal condition,  whether personal or proprietary; the sum total of a  person's legal rights, duties, liabilities and other  legal relations, or any particular group of them sep-  arately considered. So while formulating or making  the Table of the Warrant of Precedence, the status of  a functionary, either constitutional or public, cannot  be sneezed at. But in the impugned Warrant of  precedence, we have shockingly noticed that some  functionaries have been placed far below others in  derogation to their dignity, status and priority. It is  indeed ill-conceived and ill-founded.    ",
      "93. As per the impugned Warrant of Prece-  dence, the Table will be observed with respect to the  precedence of persons named therein. So the mean-  ing of the word 'precedence' is very crucial relating  to the placement of the District Judges in the said  Table. Now let us look up the meaning of the word  ‘precedence! in some standard dictionaries of the  world. In the Chambers Dictionary, New Edition  published by Allied Chambers (India) Limited, New  Delhi, 'precedence' means the act of going before in  time; the right of going before; priority; the fact of  being before in rank; the place of honour; the fore-  most place in ceremony. The word 'precedence' as  given in Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary by  AS Hornby (6th edition) means the condition of  being more important than somebody else and there-  fore coming or being dealt with first (SYN) priority.  In Black's Law Dictionary (8th edition), 'prece-                   dence’ means the order or priority in place or time  observed by or for persons of different statues (such  as political dignitaries) on the basis of rank during  ecremonial events and another meaning of the word  is generally the act or state of going before some-  thing else according to some system of priorities.    ",
      "92. Considering the above scenario, even Mr  Abdur Rab Chaudhury feels that the impugned  Warrant of Precedence may be reviewed administra-  tively.    ",
      "91. According to Lord Greene, an action of an  authority is unreasonable when it is so unreasonable  that no man acting reasonably could have taken it.  this has come to be known as Wednesbury unrea-  sonableness (Associated Provincial Picture vy  Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1KB 223). In view  of what have been stated above, we are led to hold  that the impugned Warrant of Precedence is unrea-  sonable in Wednesbury sense.    ",
      "90. Again the Members of the Public Service  Commission and the Additional Secretaries to the  Government have been bracketed together at serial  No. 19 . The Members of the Public Service Com-  mission are constitutional functionaries; but they  have been equated with the Additional Secretaries  and placed together at the same serial No. 19 . This  is plainly arbitrary bordering on absurdity.    ",
      "89. It transpires that the Secretaries to the  Government (excluding the Cabinet Secretary and  the Principal Secretary) have been placed at serial  No.16 and the Chairman of the Public Service Com-  mission has also been placed at the same serial No.  16 . Needless to say, the Chairman of the Public Ser-  vice Commission is a constitutional office-holder  and the Secretaries to the Government are persons in  the service of the Republic. So it does not stand to  reason and logic as to why the Chairman of the    Public Service Commission has been equated with  the Secretaries and placed at the self-same serial No  16 in the Table of the impugned Warrant of  Precedence.    ",
      "88. The members of the Parliament are law-  makers and constitutional incumbents. They have  been placed at serial humber 13, But quite arbitrari-  ly and whimsically, they have been downgraded by  the Cabinet Secretary, the Principal Secretary and  the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy and Air Force    who have been bracketed together at serial number  12.    ",
      "87. Given that under the constitutional scheme,  the Prime Minister, the Speaker and the Chief  Justice respectively head the three organs of the  State, that scheme appears to have been accorded a  recognition in the previous Warrant of Precedence  of 1975 to the extent of the Speaker and the Chief  Justice being placed at the same serial 4 . But it  appears that quite inexplicably, that arrangement has  been disturbed in the impugned Warrant of Prece-  dence where the position of the Chief Justice has  been downgraded by placing the Speaker at serial  No.3 without any justifiable reason. However, it will  be reasonable, logical and in accordance with con-  stitutional norms to bracket the Prime Minister, the  Speaker and the Chief Justice together at the same  serial number in the Table of the Warrant of  Precedence.    ",
      "86. Be thatas it may, from a bare reading of the  Table of the impugned Warrant of Precedence, it is  evident that some constitutional and public fune-  tionaries have been placed together at different seri-  al numbers haphazardly, arbitrarily, irrationally,  inequitably and unreasonably. Let us cite some  examples. The Cabinet Secretary, the Principal  Secretary to the Government and the Chiefs of Stal!  of the Army, Navy and Air Force have been brack-  eted together at serial No. 12; but stunningly enough,  some constitutional office holders like the Attorney-                   General, Comptroller and Auditor-General and  Ombudsman have been placed at serial No.15.  Indisputably the Cabinet Secretary, the Principal  Sceretary and the Chiefs of Staff of the Defence  Services are persons in the service of the Republic,  but their placement above those constitutional func-  tionaries in the Table is a staggering blow to the  scheme of the Constitution,    ",
      "85. With regard to the submission of Mr Abdur  Rab Chaudhury that the petitioner should have  approached the Administrative Tribunal for redress  of his grievance pertaining to the impugned Warrant  of Precedence, but instead he has approached a  wrong forum under Article 102 of the Constitution  therefor, Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud argues that the  placement of the District Judges along with others at  serial No.24 in the Table of the Warrant of  Precedence is not a term and condition of their serv-  ice and as such the petitioner is not required to  approach the Administrative Tribunal for redress of  his grievance and the matter is justifiable before the  High Court Division under Article 102 of the  Constitution. In the facts and circumstances of the  case, we find sufficient justification in the argument  of Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud.    ",
      "84. Reverting to the present case, we positive-  ly assert that we have not sermonised any quarter or  embarked upon any judicial adventurism in the garb  of judicial activism while exercising the power of  judicial under Article 102 of the Constitution.    ",
      "83. In our jurisdiction, although there is  ing tension between the executive and the judiciary  over judicial review of administrative actions, the  salutary effect of judicial review can not be skirted    around at all.    ",
      "82. The facts and circumstances of the case in  the aforementioned Civil Appeal No.5732 of 2007  and those of the instant case are poles apart. It is true  that in the garb of judicial review under Article 102  of the Constitution, this Court should not make any  encroachment upon the domains assigned to the  Executive and the Legislature. As we see it, while  exercising the power of judicial review, the Supreme  Court should be on its guard and it should not ven-  ture into judicial adventurism. It is our opinion that  the frontiers of judicial review are being expanded  with the passage of time through judicial activism  by the higher judiciary; but at the same time, care  ought to be taken to see that judicial activism does  not turn into judicial adventurism. However, we feel  tempted to quote an apt comment name by Lord  Woolf in his book \"The Pursuit of Justice\" (page-  132) edited by Christopher Campbell-Holt and pub-  lished by Oxford University Press, London which  runs thus ;  <br>  \"LT have no doubt that there is and has been,  particularly in recent times, tension between the  judiciary and the executive, and that the tension  has from time to time increased as a result of  the decisions of Judges on applications for judi-  cial review. I, however, do not regard this as a    mater of concern. It is no more than an indiea-  tion that judicial review has been working well  during a period when the other restraints on the  executive were not as great as ideally they  should be.\"    ",
      "81. MrAbdur Rab Chaudhury strenuously con-  tends that in this particular case, this Court should  exercise self-restraint and leave the matter to the                 discretion of the Executive. To buttress up this con-  tention, he has relied upon the unreported decision  dated 6-12-2007 in the case of the Divisional  Manager, Aravali Golf Club vs Chander Hass in  Appeal (Civil) 2 of 2007 . He has, in particular,  drawn our attention to paragraph 17 of that unre-  ported decision which runs as follows :  <br>  \"17 . Before parting with this case, we  would like to make some observations about the  limits of the powers of the judiciary. We are  compelled to make these observations because  we are repeatedly coming across cases where  Judge is unjustifiably trying to perform execu-  tive or legislative functions. In our opinion, this  is clearly unconstitutional, In the name of judi-  cial activism, Judges can not cross their limits  and try to take over functions which belong to  another organ of the State.\"    ",
      "80. The current Warrant of Precedence in India  has not been challenged by any quarter. So the pri-  ority or status of the District Judges of India has not  been reflected therein as per the ‘ratio’ decided in the  case of All India Judges’ Association. But that can  not be a ground for us to refrain from assailing the  impugned Warrant of Precedence in view of the  sound jurisprudential base emanating from Mayu  Hossain's case in our own jurisdiction.    ",
      "79. The logic that the District judges and the  Deputy Commissioners being district-level official  have been equated with and bracketed together at  serial No.24 in the Table of the impugned Warrant of  Precedence is fallacious for the Deputy Secretaries  to the Government being national-level post-holders  have been placed below the Deputy Commissioners  at serial No.25 in the Table. So we think, the    impugned Warrant of Precedence has no sound  basis.    ",
      "78. To our knowledge, this is a unique case not  only in our jurisdiction, but also in the whole of the    world. It seems that there is no uniformity in the  Warrants of Precedence of the neighbouring coun.  tries of Bangladesh as evidenced by Annexure-'2  series of the Affidavit-in-Opposition of the respon-  dent No.1 The contention of Mr Abdur Rab Chau-  dhury that the impugned Warrant of Precedence is  based upon international practices, customs and  usages can not be accepted after the verdict in  Masdar Hossain's case. Furthermore, it is also  meant for all purposes of the Government. But the  Indian Warrant of precedence has no application in  the day-to-day business of the Government. Has the  Warrant of Precedence of Bangladesh been sued  only for state and ceremonial occasions, it would  have no legal sanding like the United States Order  of precedence. The Warrant of Precedence of  Pakistan is conspicuously silent about its use and  observance. For all the above reasons, the impugned  Warrant of Precedence is fundamentally different  from those of India. Pakistan, USA, etc. In fact, our  Warrant of Precedence is a type by itself.    ",
      "77. There is no gainsaying the fact that the  Constitution has accorded special status to the con-  stitutional incumbents. So their priority comes first  in the Warrant of Precedence. The status of the con-  stitutionally recognized and referred post-holders,  though public functionaries, in ingrained in the  scheme of the Constitution, So in terms of priority,  their placement should follow that of the constitu-  tional incumbents. Lastly, the priority of other pub-  lic functionaries should be fixed depending on their  relative status.    ",
      "76. Since District Judges are comparable with  political executives or legislators and are, by that  reason, above administrative and defence execu-  tives, they can not be equated with or placed on a  par with administrative and defence executives in  the Table of the impugned Warrant of Precedence.  By placing the District Judges at serial No.24 along  with the Deputy Commissioners, Licutenant Colo-  nels and others in the said Table, the respondent  No.1 has demeaned and degraded them (District  Judges) for all practical purposes in the estimation  of the people. It is an indisputable fact that apart  from State and ceremonial occasions, the order in  the Warrant of Precedence is to be observed for all  purposes of the Government’ without further elabo-  ration or qualification of scope, purpose and objec-  tive of the phrase. This is perhaps the only instru-  ment of the Government for determination of one's  relative status in the eyes of the public. As the order  in the Warrant of Precedence is to be observed for  all purposes of the Government too, the placement  of the District Judges above the administrative and  defence executives in the Table thereof is all the  more necessary with an eye to upholding their rank,  priority and status in public perception. What we are  driving at boils down to this: the respondent No.1  has committed a conceptual blunder by equating the  District Judges with the administrative and defence  executives and placing them together at serial No.24  in the Table. This conceptual blunder should be cor-  rected at the earliest.    ",
      "75. It goes without saying that on administra-  tive executive, for example, a Secretary to the  Government is a member of the Staff of the  Secretariat. He does not make any policy decisions.  He just carries out the orders of the political execu-  tives and helps in the implementation of the poli  decisions. So logically it follows that an administra-  tive executive is always at the beck and call of the  political executives. But per contra, a Judicial  Officer is independent in the discharge of his funce-  tions subject to the provisions of the Constitution as  postulated by Article 116A. Again, the Chiefs of  Staff of the Defence Services are subject to the con-  trol of the political executives. The Chief of Army  Staff is, of course, a member of that Staff, though he  is the Chief thereof. The ChiefS of Naval and Air  Force Staff are also similarly situated. They are not  functionally liberated trom adherence to the order of  the political executives. They are subservient to the  political executives by the relevant laws. This being  the position, the Chiefs of Staff of the Defence  Services are not on the same footing with the politi-  cal executives, legislators and judges who represent  and exercise the State-authority.

      "74. The independence of the judiciary, as  affirmed and declared by Articles 94(4) and I 16A. is  one of the basic pillars of the Constitution and can  not be demolished, whittled down, curtailed or  diminished in any manner whatsoever, except under  the existing provisions of the Constitution as held in  Masdar Hossain's case.    ",
      "73. At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that  the Supreme Court is the guardian of the  Constitution and since the power of judicial review  has been vested therein, it is the solemn duty of the  Supreme Court to check constitutional derailments,  if any, of the two other organs of the State, namely,  the Executive and the Legislature and to bring them  on the right constitutional track. This power is not  vested in the two other organs of the State, albeit all  the three organs of the State are co-ordinate and co-  equal.    ",
      "72. The three organs of the State, namely, the  Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary are  headed by the Prime Minister, the Speaker and the  Chief Justice respectively and the three organs are to  perform their respective functions within the bounds  set by the Constitution. The political executives, that  is to say, the Ministers including the Prime Minister  exercise the executive power while the Judges of  both the Higher Judiciary and the Sub-ordinate  Judiciary exercise the judicial power of the  Republic. It must not be lost sight of the fact that in  the case of Mujibur Rahman vs Bangladesh, 33 DLR  (AD) 111, it was held in paragraph 71 that both \"the  Supreme Court and the Sub-ordinate Courts are the  repository of judicial power of the State.\"  Constitutionally, functionally and structurally, judi-  cial service stands on a different level from the civil  administrative executive services of the Republic.  While the function of the civil administrative exec-    Utive services is to assist the political executives in  formulation of policies and in execution of the poli-  cy decisions of the Government of the day, the func-  tion of the judicial service is neither of them. It is an  independent arm of the Republic, which sits on  judgment over parliamentary, executive and quasi-  judicial actions, decisions and orders, To equate and  to put on the same plane the judicial service with the  civil administrative executive services is to treat two  unequal as equals.        ",
      "71. Itis admitted fact that the pay scale of the  pistrict Judges has been fixed at Grade-3 in the  National Pay Scale of 2005 (now National Pay Scale  of 2009). This pay scale is equivalent to that of a  Joint-Seeretary to the Government of Bangladesh,  Our view is that the pay scale of'a public functionary  js not the sole determining factor of his status or  rank or precedence in the Warrant of Precedence;  put nevertheless his pay scale is pre-eminently a  determining factor in that regard. In any event, it  transpires from the order dated 8th December, 2009  that presumably the upgradation of the pay scale of  the District Judge at least to Grade 1 in the National  pay Scale of 2009 is being considered by the  Government,    ",
      "70. Mr Asaduzzaman has drawn our attention  to another order of the Appellate Division dated 8th  December, 2009 passed in Masdar Hossain's case.  The relevant extract of the order is as follows:  <br>  \"However, the learned Attorney-General  verbally submitted that he would do his best to  highlight the legal position in this regard to the  concerned authorities of the Government that  the Pay Scale of the highest post of the Judicial  Service should be refixed having regard to the  recommendation of the Judicial Service Pay  Commission and should not be below the Grade  No. 1 of the National Pay Scale.\"                 ",
      "69. It will not be out of place to mention that  Masdar Hossain’s case is still pending in the Appe}-  late Division and the various directives given in that  case are being implemented by the Government in  phases. Contempt Petition No. 7 of 2004 was filed  in the Appellate Division against some public func-  tionaries for their wilful disobedience of some of the  directives and this Contempt Petition No. 7 of 2004  along with Civil Appeal No. 79 of 1999 (Masdar  Hossain's case) are being heard together. Reitera-  ting the earlier stance, the Appellate Division passed  an order dated 9th August, 2009 therein. The rele-  vant portion of that order runs as under:  <br>  \"It should be noted that the attitude of the  supposed parallelism of the Judicial Service  with the Executive Services is not the intention  of the relevant provisions of the Constitution.  The notion of such parallelism that existed in  the past has been abandoned by the framers of  the Constitution and the constitutional reality  has to be materialized in the relevant areas  including pay and allowances of the members |  of the Judicial Service.\"    ",
      "68. Our Appellate Division in the decision in  Masdar Hossain's case in paragraph 44 has adopted  the above findings and observations made by the  Indian Supreme Court in the case of All India  Judges' Association. So the natural corollary is that  the Appellate Division has declared a law to the  effect that the members of the Judicial Service are    on a par with the political executives or the legista.  tors and above the administrative executives. This  law declared by the Appellate Division in Masdar  Hossain's case is binding upon the High Cour  Division in view of the mandate of Article 11] of  our Constitution.    ",
      "67. In the self-same case of All India Judges’  Association, it was also held in paragraph 4:    We cannot, however, help observing that  the failure to realize the distinction between the  judicial service and the other services is at the  bottom of the hostility displayed by the review  petitioners to the directions given in the ju  ment. The judicial service is not service in the  sense of ‘employment’. The judges are not                   employees, As members of the judiciary, they  the sovereign judicial power of the  State. They are holders of public offices in the  same way as the members of the council of    ministers and the members of the legislature,       When it is said that in a democracy such as  ours, the executive, the legislature and the judi-  ciaty constitute the three pillars of the State,  what is intended to be conveyed is that the three  essential functions of the State are entrusted to  the three organs of the State and each one of  them in tum represents the authority of the  State. However, those who exercise the State-  power are the ministers, the legislators and the  judges, and not the members of their staff who  implement or assist in implementing their deci-  sions. The council of ministers or the political  executive is different from the secretarial staff  or the administrative executive, which carries  out the decisions of the political executive.  Similarly, the legislators are different from the  legislative staff. So also the Judges from the  judicial staff. a pro    live executives, In some democracies like the    USA, members of some State judiciaries are  elected as much as the members of the legisla-    ture and the heads of the State. The Judges, at  whatever level they may be, represent the State    (Emphasis laid by way of underlinings is ours.)    ",
      "66. In the case of All India Judges’ Avsovia-  tion, AIR 1993 SC 2493 (Review Petition No, 249 of  1992), it was held by the Indian Supreme Court in  paragraph  <br>  This Court has, in the judgment under  review, pointed out that the linkage between the  service conditions of the judiciary and that of  the administrative executives was a historical  accident. The erstwhile rulers constituted only  one service, viz, the Indian Civil Service for  recruiting candidates for the Judicial as well as  the Administrative Services and it is from    ; among the successful candidates in the exami-  nation held for such recruitment, that some  were sent to the administrative side while oth-  ers to the judicial side. Initially, there was also  no clear demarcation between the judicial and  executive services and the same officers used to  perform judicial and executive functions. Since  the then Government had failed to make the dis-  tinction between the two services right from the  stage of the recruitment, its logical conse-  quences in terms of the service conditions could  not be avoided. With the inauguration of the  Constitution and the separation of the State  Power distributed among the three Branches.  the continuation of the linkage has become  anachronistic and is inconsistent with the con-  stitutional provisions.\"    ",
      "65. It has been clearly held in Masdar  Hossain's case that the judicial officers are in the  Service of the Republic and they are subject to the  Administrative Tribunals Act, 1981 . So the question  as to whether the judicial officers are in the service  of the Republic or cannot be re-opened in this Writ  Petition. That question has been clinched by the  Appellate Division in Masdar Hossain's case. So it  leaves no room for doubt that the judicial officers,  or, for that matter, the members of the Judicial  Service are persons in the service of the Republic.  In this context, it may be said that the term 'Service  of the Republic’ is a genus while the term ‘Judicial    Service’ is a species.    ",
      "64. In that regard, we note that in Article  152(1) of the Constitution, ‘Judicial service’, 'the  service of the Republic’ and ‘District Judge’,  amongst others, have been defined. \"Judicial serv-  ice” means a service comprising persons holding  judicial posts not being posts superior to that of a  District Judge. \"The service of the Republic\" means  any service, post or office whether in a civil or mil-  itary capacity, in respect of the Government of  Bangladesh, and any other service declared by law  to be a service of the Republic, \"District Judge\"  includes Additional District Judge.    ",
      "63. It has been asserted in unmistakable terms.  in the Writ Petition that the members of the Judicial  Service are on a par with the constitutional func-  tionaries and they are not persons in the service of  the Republic. In course of hearing of the Writ  petition and on being asked by this Court to refer to  the constitutional scheme and structure, Mr Asad-  yz-zaman has candidly conceded that the judicial  officers are not constitutional functionaries. So the  question of placement of the District Judges in the  Table of the Warrant of Precedence on a par with the  constitutional office-holders does not stand to con-    stitutional scheme.    ",
      "62. The constitutional implication of Article  114 is that the Sub-ordinate Judiciary, unlike the  Supreme Court of Bangladesh, is not a creature of  the Constitution but of law. In other words, the  Supreme Court is a creature of the Constitution; bul  the Subordinate Courts are creatures of laws.                 Against this backdrop, the judicial officers manning  the Subordinate Courts cannot be on a par with the  Judges of the Supreme Court.    ",
      "61. It is the submission of Mr Abdur Rab  Chaudhury that the impugned Warrant of Prece-  dence is a policy decision of the Government and it  cannot be judicially reviewed unless it is found to be  whimsical, capricious and arbitrary, We have  Tepeatedly asked Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury to point    out the objective standards or yardsticks, if any, on  which the impugned Warrant of Precedence may  and has to be predicated. But he has simply failed  to reply to our queries in this regard. He has instead  submitted that the impugned Warrant of Precedence  as prepared as per the directive of the President can-  not be questioned. Such a response, for want of fur-  ther substantiation, is found to be untenable. In the  Affidavit-in-Opposition filed by the respondent No,  2, it has been averred with greater forthcomingne  that the basis of the placement of various func-  tionaries in the Table of the impugned Warrant of  Precedence is indeed the subjective satisfaction of  the concerned authority. So professedly there are no  discernible subscription to any objective guidelines  or criteria or yardsticks as regards placement of var-  ious constitutional and public functionaries in the  said Table. We concur with the submission of Mr  Abdur Rab Chaudhury that a policy decision of the  Government is not subject to judicial review under  Article 102 of the Constitution unless it is arbitrary,  whimsical and capricious. However, the facts and  circumstances of the cases of the State of Maha-  rashtra vs Lok Shikshan Sanstha (AIR 1973 SC 588)  and State of UP vs UP University Colleges Pen-  sioners' Association (AIR 1994 SC 2311) adverted to  be Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury are quite distinguish-  able from those of the instant case. So the decisions  rendered in two Indian cases do not seem to be of  any avail to him. In the absence of evidence of any  discernible guidelines, objective standards, criteria  or yardsticks upon which the impugned Warrant of  Precedence is or ought to be predicated, we fell con-  strained to hold that the said Warrant of Precedence  cannot shrug off the disqualification of being arbi-  trary, irrational, whimsical and capricious and is, |  therefore, subject to judicial review under Article  102 of the Constitution.    ",
      "60. The petitioner, as already observed, is a  member of the Judicial Service and the Secretary-  General of Bangladesh Judicial Service Association,  In view of the averments made in the Writ Petition,  he does not appear to be cither an officious by-  stander or an interloper or a busybody; rather by  way of invoking the Writ Jurisdiction of the High  Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitu-  tion, he has brought to our notice a public wrong or  a public injury and that is no doubt justifiable.  Furthermore, his membership of the Judicial Service  and office held with the Bangladesh Judicial Service  Association eminently equip him both with the suf-  ficiency of interest and the insight and ability to  articulate and realize the concerns as find place in  this petition. In this connection, it may be pointed  out that Masdar Hossain's case was filed by the then  Secretary-General of the Judicial Service Associa-  tion along with some members of the Judicial  Service and that case was found to be maintainable  both by the High Court Division and the Appellate  Division. Precisely speaking, the petitioner, there-  fore, has the competency to claim a hearing under  Article 102 of the Constitution. The principles  enunciated in Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman's case, the  BELA's case and the ETV case as to the doctrine of  locus standi referred to above are, to our way of  thinking, applicable to the facts and circumstances  of the present case. So we do not find any plausible  reason for coming to a conclusion other than that the  instant Writ Petition is competent and maintainable.  Having regard to the above discussions, we have no  hesitation in holding that it is a pro bono publico lit-  igation and the petitioner is a ‘person aggrieved’  with- in the meaning of Article 102 of the  Constitution. In the result, we find that the Writ  Petition is maintainable at the instance of the peti-  loner,    ",
      "59. In the decision in the case of Ekushey Tele-  vision Ltd vs Dr Chowdhury Mahmood Hasan  reported in 54 DLR (AD) 130 (popularly known as  ETV case), it was held in paragraph 48:  <br>  \"48 . What is meant by ‘sufficient interest is  basically a question of fact and law which shall  have to be decided by the Court. None of the  fundamental rights like rule of law is subject to  mechanical measurement. They are measured  our human institutions i.e. the Courts and by  human beings i.c. the Judges, by applying law.  Therefore, there will always be an element of  discretion to be used by the Court in giving  standing to the petitioner. From the above, it  appears that the Courts of this jurisdiction have  shifted their position to a great extent from the  traditional rule of standing which contines  access to the judicial process only to those to  whom legal injuries are caused or legal wrong  is done. The narrow contines within which the  tule of standing was imprisoned for long years  have been broken and a new dimension is being  given to the doctrine of Jocus standi.\"                   ",
      "58. Where there is a written Constitution and  an independent judiciary and the wrongs suffered by  any section of the people are capable of being raised  and ventilated publicly in a Court of law, there is  bound to be greater respect for the rule of law. The  Preamble of our Constitution really contemplates a  society where there will be unflinching respect for  the rule of law and the welfare of the citizens.    ",
      "57. Ultimately Mr Justice Mostafa Kamal held  in the same case in paragraph 48:    \"48.0...    The traditional view remains true, valid  and effective till today in so far as individual  rights and individual infraction thereof are con-  cerned. But when a public injury or public  wrong or infraction of a fundamental right  affecting an indeterminate number of people is  involved, it is not necessary, in the scheme of  our Constitution, that the multitude of individu-  als who have been collectively wronged or    injured or whose collective fundamental rights  have been invaded are to invoke the jurisdiction  under Article 102 in multitude of individual    tion, espousing that particular cause is a person  aggrieved and has the right to invoke the juris-  diction under Article 102.\"    ",
      "56.  The people of Bangladesh are,  therefore, central, as opposed to ornamental, to the  framing of the Constitution. It was further held in    invasion in common with others or any citizen  or an indigenous association, as distinguished  from a local component of a foreign orzaniza-    A'S case in paragraph 47:  <br>  The Supreme Court being a vehicle, a  medium or mechanism devised by the  Constitution for the exercise of the judicial  power of the people on behalf of the people, the  people will always remain the focal point of  concern of the Supreme Court while dispensing  justice or propounding any judicial theory or  interpreting any provision of the Constitution.  Viewed in this context, interpreting the words  “any person aggrieved\" meaning only and  exclusively individuals and excluding the con-  sideration of people as a collective and consol-  idated personality will be a stand taken against  the Constitution, There is no question of  enlarging /ocus standi or legislation by Court.  The enlargement is writ large on the face of the  Constitution.\"    ",
      "55. In BELA’s case, his Lordship Mr Justice  Mostafa Kamal of the Appellate Division held in  paragraph 40:  <br>  \"40, We now proceed to say how we inter-  pret Article 102 as a whole. We do not give  much importance to the dictionary meaning or  Punctuation of the words ‘any person  aggrieved.' Article 102 of our Constitution is  not an isolated island standing above or beyond  the sea level of the other provisions of the  Constitution. It is a part of the over-all scheme,  objectives and purposes of the Constitution.  And its interpretation is inextricably linked with  the (i) emergence of Bangladesh and framing of                   its Constitution, (ii) the Preamble and Article 7,  (iii) Fundamental Principles of State Policy, (iv)  Fundamental Rights and (v) the other provi-  sions of the Constitution.”    ",
      "54. The expression ‘person aggrieved’ means a  person who even without being personally affected  has sufficient interest in the matter in dispute. When  a public functionary has a public duty owed to the  public in general, every citizen has sufficient inter-  est in the performance of that public duty.    ",
      "53. Article 102 of our Constitution speaks  about ‘person aggrieved’, What is the meaning of  this expression? The Constitution has not defined  the expression, nor has it mentioned ‘personally  aggrieved person’. An expression occurring in the  Constitution cannot be interpreted out of context or  only by reference to the decisions of foreign juris-  dictions where the constitutional dispensations are  different from ours. In interpreting the expression  ‘person aggrieved’, it cannot be overlooked that the  English Courts which ‘introduced the restrictive rule  of standing vastly shifted from their traditional view  which was ultimately changed by legislation. The  expression has to be given a meaning in the context  of the scheme and objectives of the Constitution and  in the light of the purpose behind the grant of the  right to the individuals and the power to the Court.  Any interpretation, which undermines the scheme or  objectives of the Constitution, or defeats the purpose  for which the jurisdiction is created, is to be dis-  carded. It has to be noted that the framers of the  Constitution envisioned a society in which the rule  of law, fundamental human rights and freedom,  equality and justice (political, economic and social)  would be secured for all citizens, They spoke about  their vision in the Preamble in no uncertain terms,    To give full effect to the rule of law, substantive pro.  vision has been made in Article 7, which states that  all powers in the Republic, shall be exercised only  under and by the authority of the Constitution, The  vision of the society has been re-stated in Article §  and elaborated in other Articles of Part II. Article  8(2) specifically states that the principles of State  policy set down in Part II will be fundamental to the  government of Bangladesh. To ensure the funda-  mental human rights and freedom and equality and  justice, the Constitution has guaranteed a host of  rights in Part IIIf as fundamental rights. And to  ensure that the mandate of the Constitution. is  obeyed, the Supreme Court has been given the wide  power of judicial review. In this background, can  the expression ‘person aggrieved’ be given a mean-  ing in consonance with the traditional view of locus  standi and thereby producing a result deprecated by  Schwartz and Wade as inimical to a healthy system  of administrative law and contrary to the public  interest? The Appellate Division has answered the  question in the negative in the case of Dr Mohiuddin  Farooque vs Bangladesh reported in 49 DLR (AD) |  (popularly known as BELA's case).    ",
      "52. The Appellate Division settled seven gen-  eral principles in Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman's case as  to the standing of a person aggrieved, namely, (1)  the High Court Division does not suffer trom any  lack of jurisdiction under Article 102 to hear a per>  son; (2) the High Court Division will grant /ocus                   srandi to a person who agitates a question affecting,  a constitutional issue of grave importance, posing a  threat to his fundamental rights which pervade and  extend to the entire territory of Bangladesh; (3) if'a  fundamental right is involved, the impugned matter  need not affect a purely personal right of the appli-  cant touching him alone it is enough if he shares that  right in common with others; (4) in interpreting the  words ‘any person aggrieved’, consideration of  ‘Fundamental Rights' in Part IIT of the Constitution  is a relevant one; (5) it is the competency of the per-  son to claim a hearing which is at the heart of the  interpretation of the words \"any person aggrieved\";  (6) it is a question of exercise of discretion by the  High Court Division as to whether it will treat that  person aggrieved or not; and (7) the High Court  Division will exercise that jurisdiction upon the con-    sideration of the facts and circumstances of each  case.    ",
      "51. In the case of Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman vs  Bangladesh reported in 26 DLR (AD) 44 (common-  ly known as Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman's case), it was  held, inter alia, in paragraph 17:        It appears to us that the question of focus  standi does not involve the Court's jurisdiction  to hear a person but of the competency of the  person to claim a hearing, so that the question is  one of discretion which the Court exercises  upon due consideration of the facts and circum-  stances of each case.\"    ",
      "50. In the case of Bangladesh Retired Govern-  ment Employees' Welfare Association vs Bangladesh  reported in 46 DLR 426, the High Court Division  accepted the standing of the said Association hold-  ing— <br>   \"Since the Association has an interest in  ventilating the common grievance of all its  members who are retired Government employ-  ees, in our view, this Association is a 'person  aggrieved'...\"    ",
      "49. In that case, public interest litigation was  not involved. There was no difficulty on the part of  the newspaper-owners to challenge the award them-  selves. So the Appellate Division denied standing to  the Association of newspaper-owners. The observa-  tion quoted above must be understood in the light of  the facts of that case.    ",
      "48. The wave of this development also reached  Pakistan, In the case of Benazir Bhutto vs Federa-  tion of Pakistan, PLD 1988 SC 416, the Pakistan  Supreme Court held that as the provision of Article  184(3) (which corresponds to Indian Article 32) is  open-ended, the proceedings could be maintained  by an individual whose fundamental rights are  infracted or by a person bona fide alleging infraction  of the fundamental rights of a class or a group of  persons, as there is no rigid incorporation of the  notion of ‘aggrieved party’ in Article 184 (3).    In the case of Bangladesh Sangbadpatra  Parishad vs Bangladesh reported in 43 DLR (AD)  J26, the Association of newspaper-owners chal-  lenged an award given by the Wage Board and the  High Court Division dismissed the petition holding  that the Association had no locus standi, The  Appellate Division upheld the finding of the High  Court Division. Dealing with the Indian decisions  regarding public interest litigation, the Appellate  Division observed in paragraphs 9 and 10:  <br>  \"9 . In our Constitution, the petitioner seeking  enforcement of a fundamental right or constitu-  tional remedies must be a ‘person aggric-ved.\"  Our Constitution is not at pari materia with the  Indian Constitution on this point. The Indian  Constitution, either in Article 32 or in Article  226, has not mentioned who can apply for  enforcement of fundamental rights and constitu-  tional remedies. The Indian Courts only hon-  oured a tradition in requiring that the petitioner  must be an ‘aggrieved person.’ The emergence  in India of pro bono publico litigation, that is lit-  igation at the instance of a public-spirited citizen  espousing causes of others, has been facilitated    by the absence of any Constitutional provision    as to who can apply for a writ. In England, var-    ious tests were applied. Some-times it was said  that a person must be ‘aggrie-ved' or he must  have ‘a specific legal right’ or he must have 'suf-  ficient interest’, Now after the introduction of  the new Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 53  Rule 3, any person can apply for ‘judicial  review’ in England under the Supreme Court  Act, 1981 if he has ‘sufficient interest.’   <br> 10 . Therefore, the decisions of the Indian  jurisdiction on public interest Jit  hardly apt in our situation, We must confine  ourselves to asking whether the petitioner is an  ‘aggrieved person’, a phrase which has received  a meaning and a dimension over the years.\"    ",
      "47. In India, the concept of public interest liti-  gation (public-spirited citizens bringing matters of  great public importance) was initiated by Mr VR  Krishna lyer, J in the case of Mumbai Kamgar  Sabha, Bombay vs Ms Abdul Bhai reported in AIR  1976 SC 1466 . However, a definite jurisprudential  basis was laid down .in the case of SP Gupta vy  President of India reported in AJR 1982 SC 149  where several advocates of different Bars chal-  lenged the action of the Government in transferring  some Judges of the High Courts. In that case, in  according standing to the petitioners, Justice Bhag-  wati observed in paragraph 17:  <br>  \"17, Where a legal wrong or a legal injury  is caused to a person or to a determinate class of  persons by reason of violation of any constitu-  tional or legal right or any burden is imposed in  contravention of any constitutional or legal pro-  vision or without authority of law or any such  legal wrong or legal injury or illegal burden is  threatened and such person or determinate class  of persons is, by reason of poverty, helplessness  or disability or socially or economically disad-  vantaged position, unable to approach the Court  for relief, any member of the public can main-  tain an application....... seeking judicial redress  for the legal wrong or injury caused to such per-  son or determinate class of persons.\"                   ",
      "46. With the increase of governmental func-  tions, the English Courts found the necessity of lib-  eralizing the standing rule to preserve the integrity  of the rule of law. When a public-spirited citizen  challenged the policy of the police department not to  prosecute the gaming clubs violating the gaming  law, the Court heard him, though no clear-cut and    definitive answer to the standing question was  given. (RV Metropolitan Police Commissioner ex p  Blackburn [1968] 1 All ER 763) The Court also  heard Mr Blackburn challenging the action of the  Government in joining the European Common  Market. (Blackburn vs Attorney-General [1971] >  All ER 1380) Again, Mr Blackburn was accorded  standing in enforcing the public duty owed by the  police and Greater London Council in respect ot  exhibition of pornographic films. (RV Metropolitan  Police Commissioner ex P Blackburn [1973] All ER  324). In all the cases mentioned above, the duty  owed by the public authorities was to the general  public and not an individual or to a determinate  class of persons and the applicants were found to  have /ocus standi as they had ‘sufficient interest’  the performance of the public duty.    in    ",
      "45. Before we proceed further in quest of the  meaning of the term ‘person aggrieved’ in Article  102 of our Constitution, it will be worthwhile to  note the development in other jurisdictions in this  regard.    ",
      "44. The traditional view of locus standi has an    “adverse effect on the rule of law. Schwartz and    Wade commented in \"Legal Control of Govern-  ment\" (1972) edition) at 291:  <br>  \"Restrictive rules about standing are in  general inimical to a healthy system of admin-  istrative law. If a plaintiff with a good case is  turned away, merely because he is not suffi-  ciently affected personally, that means that  some government agency is left free to violate  the law, and that is contrary to public interest.\"    ",
      "43. The Indian Supreme Court also followed  the English decisions in the matter of standing both  for the enforcement of fundamental rights and for  other constitutional remedies.    ",
      "42. The leading English case on /ocus standi is  ex parte Sidebotham, (1880) 14 Ch D 458 whether  the Court held that a person aggrieved is a man  \"who has suffered a legal grievance, a man against  whom a decision has been pronounced which has.  wrongly deprived him of something, or wrongfully  refused him something, or wrongfully affected his  title to something.” The same view was taken in sub-  sequent cases. The Pakistani and Indian Courts were  greatly influenced by these English decisions, In the  case of Tariq Transport Company, Lahore vs  Sargodha-Bhera Bus Service, Sargodha reported in  11 DLR (SC) 140, the Supreme Court of Pakistan  observed. \".....a person seeking judicial review must  show that he has a direct personal interest in the act  which he challenges before his prayer for review is  entertained.\" That Writ Petition was filed under  Article 170 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1956.  The same view was taken in respect of locus strani  under Article 98 of the Constitution of Pakistan,                   1962 . Therefore, an association, though registered,  did not have /ocus standi to vindicate the personal or  individual grievance of its members, But in the case  of Mian Fazal Din vs Lahore Improvement Trust  reported in 27 DLR (SC) 225, the Pakistan Supreme  Court took somewhat liberal view stating—    he right considered sufficient for  maintaining a proceeding of this nature is not  ssarily a right in the strict juristic sense; but  enough if the applicant disclose that he had  a personal interest in the performance of the  legal duty, which if not performed or performed  in a manner not permitted by law, would result  in the loss of some personal benefit or advan-  tage or the curtailment of a privilege or liberty  or franchise.\"    ",
      "41. Under Article 102 of our Constitution  except for an application for habeas corpus or quo  warranto, a Writ Petition can be filed only by a 'per-  son aggrieved’, Thus in order to have locus standi to  invoke the jurisdiction, an applicant has to show that  he is an aggrieved party in an application for certio-  rari, mandamus or prohibition.    ",
      "40. Judicial review is a common law remedy in  England. In \"Administrative Law\", by HWR Wade,  6th edition, it has been mentioned at page 280 \"The  Courts of law have inherent jurisdiction, as a matter  of common law, to prevent administrative authori-  ties from exceeding their powers or neglecting their  duties.\" The power of judicial review conferred by  Article 102 in our jurisdiction is a basic feature of  the Constitution and in view of the decision in  Anwar Hossain Chowdhury's case 1989 BLD (Spl) 1  = 41 DLR (AD) 165, it cannot be taken away or cur-  tailed even by amendment of the Constitution,    ",
      "39. In judicial review, the Court is concerned  with the question whether the impugned action in  lawful or unlawful and the basic power of the Court  in relation to an illegal decision are to quash it. If the  matter has to be decided again, it must be done the  original deciding authority. The Court exercises the  power of judicial review on the basis that powers  can be validly exercised only within their limits and  a public functionary is not to be allowed to trans-    gress the limits of his authority conferred by the  Constitution or the laws. The Court also exercises  the power of judicial review if an impugned action  or decision is malafide and in case of violation of  fundamental rights.    ",
      "38. In the first place, we are to determine as to  whether the petitioner has the Jocus standi to file the  Writ Petition. In other words, we are to determine as  to whether he can cross the threshold stage vis-a-vis  the impugned Warrant of Precedence.    ",
      "37. We have heard the submissions of Mr  Rokanuddin Mahmud, Dr M Zahir and Mr Asad-uz-  zaman and the counter-submissions of Mr Abdur  Rab Chaudhury and perused the Writ Petition,  Supplementary Affidavit, A ffidavits-in-Opposition,  and Supplementary A ffidavit-in-Opposition and the  relevant Annexures annexed thereto.    ",
      "36. Mr Md Nazrul Islam Talukder, the learned  Deputy Attorney-General appearing for the respon-  dent No.2 and Mr SM Rezaul Karim, the learned  Advocate appearing for the respondent No.3, adopt  the submissions advanced by Mr Abdur Rob  Chaudhury.    ",
      "35. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury next submits  that the impugned Warrant of Precedence cannot be  assailed in that it is predicated upon international  practices, customs and usages,    ",
      "34. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury further submits  that following the decision in the case of All India  Judges’ Association, the current Warrant of Prece-  dence in India has not been amended as yet and it  appears that the decision rendered in that case by the  Indian Supreme Court is yet to be implemented  fully.    ",
      "33. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury also submits  that at the most, the impugned Warrant of Prece-  dence may be reviewed administratively, but not  judicially.    ",
      "32. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury next submits  that all the three organs of the State, that is to say,  the executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary have  to function within the parameters set by the  Constitution itself and the Judiciary should not  make any incursion upon the provinces assigned to  the Executive and the Legislature and in this per-  spective, ‘this Court should wash its hands of the  matter.                   ",
      "31. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury also submits |  that this Court should exercise self-restraint and  refrain from judicially reviewing the impugned  Warrant of Precedence inasmuch as it is the function  of the Executive to frame it and the Executive has  the expertise in determining the precedence of the  persons named in the Table.    ",
      "30. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury further submits  that as per the National Pay Scale of 2005 and there-  after, as per National Pay Scale of 2009, the scale of  District Judge has been fixed as Grade 3; but none the  less, they pay scale in not the determining factor for  determination of precedence of a functionary in the  Table of the Warrant of Precedence and though the  District Judges are getting the pay scale of Joint  Secretaries to the Government of Bangladesh, but  regard being had to the functions of the Joint  Secretaries pervading throughout the country, they  have been placed above the District Judges in the said  Table and since a District Judge is a District-level offi-  cial, he has been rightly placed with the deputy  Commissioner at serial No.24 in the Table and this  being the state of affairs, no exception can be taken  thereto.    ",
      "29. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury further submits  that the petitioner being a public servant should  have invoked the jurisdiction of the Administrative  Tribunal for redress of his grievance in respect of  placement of the District Judges at serial No.24 in  the Table of the impugned Warrant of Precedence;  but this having not been done, he has not standing  under Article 102 of the Constitution.    ",
      "28. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury also submits  that the Writ Petition is an amalgam of both a Writ  of Certiorari and a Writ of Mandamus and as the  Petitioners has no legal right to pray for issuance of  a Writ of Mandamus, the respondent No.1 can not be    directed to revise the impugned Warrant of  Precedence or to frame a new one.    ",
      "27. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury next submits  that the petitioner has no /ocus standi to prefer the  Writ Petition under Article 102 of the Constitution  in view of the fact that he has not come up to  espouse a public cause and as such the Writ Petition  should be held to be incompetent.    ",
      "26. Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury further submits  that the impugned Warrant of Precedence is a policy  decision of the Government and from this stand-  point, it is not judicially reviewable unless it is  capricious, whimsical and arbitrary. In support of  this submission, he refers to two decisions of the  Indian Supreme Court reported in AIR 1973 SC 588  (State of Maharashtra vs Lok Shikshan Sanstha and  others) and AIR 1994 SC 2311 (State of UP vs UP  University Colleges Pensioners’ Association).    ",
      "25. On the contrary, Mr Abdur Rab Chaudhury,  the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the res-  pondent No.1, submits that the President in his wis-  dom directed the framing of the impugned Warrant  of Precedence and the wisdom of the President can  not be questioned by filing this Writ Petition and as  such, the Writ Petition should be held to be no main-  tainable under Article 102 of the Constitution.    ",
      "24. Mr Asaduzzaman, another leamed Counsel  appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that  placing of the District Judges at serial No.24 in the  Table of the Warrant of Precedence is a public  wrong as well as a public injury and the petitioner  being a conscious citizen and the Secretary-General  of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association has  come up with the present Writ Petition to redress the  said public wrong and public injury. As to the stand-  ing of the petitioner under Article 102 of the  Constitution, Mr Asaduzzaman adverts to the ETV's  case reported in 54 DLR (AD) 130.    ",
      "23. Dr M Zahir, another learned Counsel  appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that  constitutionally, functionally and structurally, the  members of the judicial service are a class apart and  in that view of the matter, they can not be compared  or equated with the members of the civil executive  services and it has been categorically and unequivo-  cally held in the case of All India Judges' Associa-  tion and the case of Masdar Hossain that even the  judges of the sub-ordinate judiciary stand on a par  with the political executives and the legislators and  as such, if any comparison is to be made, then that  should be made between the judges and the political  executives and the legislators; but curiously enough,  the District Judges have been placed at serial No.24  in the Table of the Warrant of Precedence which is  derogatory to their dignity and status and this will  have negative impact on the public psyche resulting  in loss of respect of the people for them.                 ",
      "22. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud nest submits  that it is a public interest litigation, pure and simple  and the petitioner being a member of the judicial  service and the Secretary-General of the Judicial  Service Association has the standing or locus standi  to file the Writ Petition and he represents a vast mul-  titude of persons who can not come up with Writ  Petitions individually on the self-same averments  before this Court and over and above, the petitioner  is not an interloper or a busybody and he has tried to  vindicate the dignity, prestige and honour of the  office of the District Judge in the perception of the  people by challenging the placement of the District  Judge at serial No.24 in the Table of the impugned  Warrant of Precedence. In support of the standing of  the petitioner, Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud has drawn  our attention to Masdar Hossain's case, 52 DLR  (AD) 82 and BELA's case, 49 DLR (AD) 1.    ",
      "21. Mr Rokanuddin Mahmud further submits  that excepting the Cabinet Secretary and the Princi-  pal Secretary to the Government, the other Secre-  taries have curiously been placed at serial No.16 in  the Table of the impugned Warrant of Precedence  and since the Principal Secretary, the Cabinet  Secretary and the other Secretaries stand on the  same footing, it does not stand to reason as to why    the Cabinet Secretary and the Principal Secretary    have been placed for above the other Secretaries in  the Table and this scenario is indicative of the capri-  ciousness, Whimsicality and unreasonableness on  the part of the respondent No.1 in framing the  impugned Warrant of Precedence, though it is pur-  ported to have been framed at the directive of the  President.    ",
      "20. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud also submits  that the impugned Warrant of Precedence, having  not been based on reason, logic, rationality and the  constitutional scheme is liable to be knocked down.    ",
      "19. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud also Submits  that since the Constitution is the supreme law of the  Republic, the constitutional office-holders must  have precedence in the Table of the Warrant of  Precedence first and thereafter the constitutionally  referred, defined or recognized posts like the posts  of the District Judge and the Chiefs of Staff of the  Defence Services of Bangladesh are to be placed in  the said Table followed by the placement of other  public functionaries and this having not been done  by the respondent No.1, the impugned Warrant of  Precedence is malafide and of no legal effect.    ",
      "18. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud also submits that  our Appellate Division in Masdar Hossain's case has  adopted the ‘ratio’ enunciated in the case of All India  judges’ Association that the Judges of the Sub-ordi-  nate Judiciary are also the wielders of the judicial  power of the Republic and they represent the author-  ity of the republic just like the political executives and  the legislators and as such the District Judges should  have been placed at an appropriate place in the Table  of the Warrant of Prece-dence.    ",
      "17. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud next submits  that the Sub-ordinate Judiciary occupies a special  place in Chapter II of Part VI of the Constitution:  but that was inexplicably disregarded at the time  framing of the impugned Warrant of Precedence and                 pistrict Judges exercising the judicial power of the  Republic should have been placed above the  sceretaries to the Government of Bangladesh inclu-  ding the Cabinet Secretary in the  Warrant of Precedence, regard being had to the ‘ratio  decidendi’ in all India Judges' Association case (AIR  1903 SC 2493) and Masdar Hossain's case (52 DLR  (AD) $2),       ",
      "16. Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud further submits  that pursuant to Article 55(6) of the Constitution, the  Rules of Business, 1996 were framed and Schedule  1 of the Rules of Business deals with allocation of  business among the different Ministries and  Divisions and as per the said Schedule | of the Rules  of Business, the Cabinet Division has been allocat-  ed the subject \"Warrant of Precedence’; but the  Cabinet Secretary upon opaque considerations has  placed himself along with the Chiefs of Staff of the  Army Navy and Air Force and the Principal  Secretary to the Government at serial No. 12 where-  as some constitutional functionaries like the Attor-  ney-General for Bangladesh, the Comptroller and  Auditor-General and the Ombudsman have been  placed at serial No. 15 in the Table of the Warrant of  Precedence and this placement of the Cabinet  Secretary and others above those constitutional  functionaries is an affront to the scheme of the  Constitution and this is why, the said Warrant of  Precedence is liable to be struck down as being  unconstitutional.    ",
      "15. At the outset, Mr Rokan Uddin Mahmud.  the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the peti-  tioner, submits that the impugned Warrant of  Precedence, 1986 does not provide for any objective  standard or yardstick on which it is based and. as  such, it is ex facie clear that the same was arbitrari-  ly framed and in this view of the matter, it is with-  out lawful authority and of no legal effect.    ",
      "14. The case of the respondent No. 2 as set out  in the Affidavit-in-Opposition, in brief, runs as fol-  lows:  <br>  The petitioner has no /ocus standi to file the  Writ Petition as a public interest litigation. The  impugned Warrant of Precedence, 1986 was made  by the Cabinet Division according to the directive of  the President. The placement of District Judges in  the Table of the Warrant of Precedence is the sub-  ject-matter of the Administrative Tribunal and by  that reason, the instant Writ Petition under Article  102 of the Constitution is misconceived, It is true  that the post of the District Judge is these highest    post of the subordinate judiciary. Since the District  Judge is the highest post at the field-level, so is the  case with the Deputy Commissioner at the field.  level in the executive side. So both District Judges  and Deputy Commissioners have been placed  together at the same serial number 24 in the Table of  the Warrant of Precedence. The subjective satisfac-  tion of the authority cannot be questioned in respect  of placement of the persons in the said Table.    ",
      "13. The respondent No. | has also filed a sup-  plementary affidavit-in-opposition virtually reiterat-  ing the averments made in the original A ffidavit-in-  Opposition. So the statements made in the supple-  mentary affidavit-in-opposition are not repeated.    ",
      "12. The political executives formulate the poli-  cies of the Government and supervise the enforce-  ment of the laws and policies. But the actual work  of enforcing the laws and policies of the                 Government is done by the administrative execu-  tives. The Constitution assigns to the Legislature,  the Executive and the Judiciary clearly demarcated  roles; each controlled by constitutional provisions.  The responsibility of seeing that no functionary of  the State oversteps the limit of his power is, of  y, On the Judiciary; but this does not render  the judiciary a superior organ of the State. It  remains as a co-ordinate and co-equal organ with the  other two organs of the State, namely, the Executive  and the Legislature, though it has to perform the del-  icate task of ensuring compliance with the provi-  sions of the Constitution by all the organs of the  State. The separation of the lower judiciary from  the executive organ of the State and its independ-  ence from the executive influence do not mean that  the judicial officers are above the administrative  executives. They are independent in the discharge  of their judicial functions subject to the provisions  of the Constitution, Since the judicial officers are  public servants like the administrative executives;  the placement of District Judges together with  Deputy Commissioners at serial No, 24 in the Table  of the Warrant of Precedence is lawful. As the pol-  icy decision of the Government, the Warrant of  Precedence is not subject to judicial review.    ",
      "11. Chapter 1 of Part IX of the Constitution    deals with the services of Bangladesh generally.  Persons belonging to the Judicial Service are not  members of the civil executive services, though they  are in the service of the Republic. But it does not  mean or imply that they enjoy higher status than that  of the persons belonging to the defence services,  local Government and civil executive services, The  service conditions stipulated under Articles 133 and  135 of the Constitution do equally apply to the judi-  cial officers as well as the civil executive officers.  Therefore, civil executive officers are also within    the scheme of the same Constitution and they may    certainly be different in respect of powers and func-    tions from judicial officers. But for that reason, civil    executive officers cannot be treated as inferior to  judicial officers and vice versa. Different services  like defence services, local Government, judicial  service and all other services of the Republic have  been duly considered, contemplated, recognised and  dealt with at different places and under different  Articles of the Constitution, as were deemed appro-  priate by the framers of the Constitution keeping in  mind the broad principles of separation of powers in  the scheme of the Constitution. Nowhere in the  Constitution, it has been contemplated that the judi-  cial service shall enjoy a higher rank and status or  position than other services of the Republic. The  terms and conditions of services of the constitution-  al functionaries are regulated and determined by  special laws, and not by rules, as mandated by  Article 147 of the Constitution. The attempt of the  petitioner to raise the judicial officers to the level of  the constitutional functionaries by filing the instant  Writ Petition is an unscrupulous attempt to under-  mine the dignity, status and position of the constitu-  tional functionaries. Since the judicial officers are  persons in the service of the Republic, the District  Judges have been rightly and properly placed at seri-    al No. 24 in the Table of the impugned Warrant of  Precedence. District Judges hold district-level posts    like Deputy Commissioners and at the district-level,    they have been shown at the highest serial number    above Civil Surgeons and Superintendents of Police.    Deputy Secretaries to the Government are national    level posts and for that reason, they have been    shown at serial number 25 not as being within their  respective charges. It is an unfounded claim that    District Judges being the highest post-holders in the    Bangladesh Judicial Service are on the same footing    with political and legislators. Such a claim has no  legal or constitutional basis.    ",
      "10. The President, Prime Minister, Speaker,  Ministers, Judges of the Supreme Court, Attorney-  General, Comptroller and Auditor-General, Election  Commissioners and the like are no doubt constitu-  tional office-holders; but it can not be said by any  stretch of imagination that the members of the  Judicial Service are constitutional functionaries.  They are persons in the service of the Republic and  their jurisdictions are circumscribed by territorial  limits and that being so, they cannot be equated with  and placed together with the constitutional incum-  bents in the Table of the impugned Warrant of  Precedence.    ",
      "9. Prior to framing of the Warrant of Prece-  dence in 1986, the Secretaries’ Committee examined  its draft prepared by the Cabinet Division and this  Committee made recommendations — thereon.  Eventually, the recommendations were placed in a  meeting before the Council Committee headed by  Rear Admiral Sultan Ahmad, DCMLA, Chief’ of  Naval Staff and Minister for Ports, Shipping and  Inland Water Transports to review the proposal of                   the Warrant of Preceden In that meeting, the  position and status of different functionaries were  examined in order to maintain appropriate equiva-  Jence in the allied bodies. Thereafter, the Council  Committee made recommendations for making  required changes in the then Warrant of Precedence  which were ultimately approved by the President.  Ry the way, in the Warrant of Precedence of  pakistan, it is found that the position of the District  Judges and that of the Deputy Commissioners are at  serial No. 27, On the other hand, in India and Nepal,  the positions of the District Judge and the Deputy  Commissioner have not even been included in their  respective Warrants of Precedence, However, as the  guardian of all the three organs of the State, the  President properly determined the placements of  various functionaries in the Table of the Warrant of  Precedence in 1986 and since then it was updated in  1987, 1988, 1991 and 2000.    ",
      "8. The Writ Petition is incompetent as a pub-  lic interest litigation. The impugned Warrant of  Precedence, 1986 is an executive flat and, as such, it  is not judicially reviewable. According to the Cons-  titution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the  President is the Head of the State and all the execu-  tive actions of the Government are expressed to be  taken in the name of the President. In accordance  with the Constitution, the appointments of the Prime  Minister, Chief Justice of Bangladesh, Judges of the  Supreme Court, Ministers, Attorney-General, Chiefs,  of Staff of the Defence Services, Comptroller and  Auditor-General, Chief Election Commissioner and  Election Commissioners, Chairman and Members  of the Public Service Commission, Members of the  Services of the Republic, Members of the Judicial  Service etc. are made by the President. He is the  guardian of all the three organs of the State, namely,  the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.  The impugned Warrant of Precedence was promul-  gated in pursuance of his direction. It is true that the  District Judges and Deputy Commissioners have  been placed along with others at serial No. 24 in the  Table of the Warrant of Precedence. But the post of  the Deputy Commissioner is not a mid-level post of  the Republic. According to the charter of duties, the  post of the Deputy Commissioner is the highest post  of the district administration. In that view of the  matter, the District Judges have been equated and  placed together with the Deputy Commissioners at  serial No. 24 in the Table.    ",
      "7. The respondent Nos, | and 3 has contested  the Rule by filing three separate A flidavits-in-Oppo-  sition, The averments made in the Affidavits-in-    Opposition of the respondent No. | and the respon-  dent No. 3 are almost similar, Their case as set out  in the Affidavits-in-Opposition, in brief, runs as fol-  lows:    ",
      "6. In the supplementary-affidavit filed on  behalf of the petitioner, it has been averred that dif-  ferent countries like Canada, Australia, England and  Sri Lanka have made Warrants of Precedence con-  sidering their respective Constitutions and laws.    ",
      "5. The Judicial Service is not 'service’ in the  sense of employment. The Judges are not employ-  ees. As members of the Judiciary, they exercise the  sovereign judicial power similarly as the members  of the Cabinet exercise the executive power and the  members of the Legislature exercise the legislative  power of the Republic. In a democracy such as ours,  the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary con-  stitute the three pillars of the State and by such a  conception, it is intended to be conveyed that the  three essential functions of the State are entrusted to  the three organs of the State and each one of them in  tum represents the authority of the State. Those  who exercise the State-power are Ministers, Le  lators and Judges and not the members of their staff  who implement or assist in the implementation of  their decisions. So in that view of the matter, the  members of the Judicial Service cannot be equated  with administrative executives; rather as the wield-  ers of the State-power, they are on a par with politi-  cal executives and legislators. Judicial independ-  ence cannot be secured by making mere solemn  proclamations about it. It has to be secured both in  substance and in practice. The society has a stake in  ensuring the independence of the Judiciary and no  price is too heavy to secure it. Anyway, Sub-ordi-  nate Courts occupy a special place in the Constitu-  tion under Articles 114 to LLOA, The recruitment  and conditions of service of the members of the                   Judicial Service are regulated by the Rules made by  the President under Article 115 of the Constitution,  Si as per Note: 1 of the impugned Warrant of  Precedence, the order therein is to be observed for  State and ceremonial occasions as well as for all  purposes of the Government, it has lowered them  down in the estimation of the people. It is necessary  for them in the public interest and in the interest of  justice to be seen to be of a rank sufficient to com-  mand obedience to their judgments and orders. As  the Warrant of Precedence has an effect on the pub-  lic psyche, it should necessarily reflect the rank, sta-  tus and precedence of the District Judges properly.  So the relative ranking of the functionaries in the  Table of the Warrant of Precedence is of a signifi-  cant nature, and not merely of a ceremonial nature.  This, in fact, affects the ability of the District Judges  and other Judicial Officers to perform their func-  tions effectively and independently without virtual-  ly being or being seen to be inferior to certain cate-  gories of civil servants. The placement of the  District Judges at serial No. 24 in the Table of the  impugned Warrant of Precedence is derogatory to  the dignity of their office and is violative of Article  31 of the Constitution. The impugned Warrant of  Precedence fails to appreciate that all constitutional  posts, such as the Judges of the Supreme Court of  Bangladesh, Attorney-General, Comptroller and  Auditor-General, Members of Parliament and  Members of the Judicial Service etc. are not parts of  the Civil Service of the Republic and they cannot be  compared with the servants of the Republic and the  members of the Civil Service and the Armed Forces  in particulary Hence, the impugned Warrant of  Precedence is liable to be struck down as being arbi-  trary, malafide and wltra vires the Constitution.    ",
      "4. In the Table of the impugned Warrant of  Precedence, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh being  the head of the judicial organ has been placed at  serial No.4 . Some constitutional office-holders like  the Attorney-General for Bangladesh, Comptroller  and Auditor-General and Ombudsman have been  placed at serial No.15 while the employees of the  Republic like the Cabinet Secretary, Chiefs of Staff  of the Army, Navy and Air Force and Principal  Secretary to the Government have been placed at  serial No. 12 in the said Table. District Judges have  been placed at serial No. 24 equating them with  Deputy Commissioners who are the mid-level  employees of the Republic. The impugned Warrant  of Precedence does not provide for any rational  basis and, as such, it is arbitrary. In the scheme of  our Constitution, the post the District Judge is the    highest post of the Bangladesh Judicial Service.  The required qualification for appointment to the  post of the District Judge is 15(fifteen) years service  including two years experience as an Additional    District Judge. However, in spite of the directions  given by the Appellate Division in the ease of the  Secretary, Ministry of Finance vs Masdar Hossain  reported in 52 DLR (AD) 82 (hereinafter referred to  as Masdar Hossain’s case), the Government has  failed to introduce a separate pay scale for the mem-  bers of the Judicial Service. The initial pay scale of  a District Judge being at grade 3 of the National P:  Scale of 2005 is equivalent to that of a Joint-Secre-  tary to the Government. The Additional District  Judge is the second highest post of the Judicial  Service enjoying 4th grade of the said National Pay  Scale of 2005 . The members of the other tiers of the  Judicial Service are Joint-District Judges, Senior  Assistant Judges and Assistant Judges.    ",
      "3. The petitioner is an Additional District and  Sessions Judge and the Secretary-General of the  Bangladesh Judicial Service Association. He is @  conscious citizen of Bangladesh. He is keen lv  uphold the fundamental rights of the citizens  enshrined in the Constitution of the People’s  Republic of Bangladesh. He has served a good                 number of years in the Sub- ordinate Judiciary and is    thus conscious of the dignity, prestige and honour of  the Judiciary. He is aware of his duty as a citizen in    consonance with Article 21 of the Constitution to    ensure the observance of the Constitution and the    Jaws of Bangladesh, As a conscious member of the    society and the Secretary-General of the Bangladesh    Judicial Service Association, the Petitioner feels    aggrieved by the impugned notification No. CD-    10/1/8S-Rules/361 dated 11-9-1986 (Annexure-A),    He has filed the Writ Petition in his capacity as a  concemed, affected and aggrieved citizen to protect  the interest of indefinite number of people of  Bangladesh and, to uphold the Rule of Law by way  of public interest litigation and to prevent illegal and  arbitrary placement of the members of the judicial  service and the constitutional office-holders in inap-  propriate places in the Warrant of Precedence in  derogation of their dignity and status in public per-  ception. The petitioner being committed to the wel-  fare of Republic and to uphold the Rule of Law  brings this action \"pro bono publico” challenging  the impugned Warrant of Precedence.    ",
      "1.  Article 31 of the Constitution contemplates  that (0 enjoy the protection of the law, and to be  treated in accordance with law, and only in  accordance with law, is the inalienable right of  every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every  other person for the time being within  Bangladesh, and in particular no action detri-  mental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or  property of any person shall be taken except in  accordance with law.  <br>  District Judges have the inalienable right to be treat-  ed in accordance with the law declared by the Appellate  Division. So they have a legal right to pray for issuance of  a Writ of Mandamus and the respondent No.1 has a legal  duty to comply therewith by placing the District Judges  appropriately in the Table of the Warrant of Precedence as  per the dictates of the law clearly enunciated in Masdar  Hossain's case by the Appellate Division.     Warrant of Precedence—Directions—As the  Constitution is the supreme law of the land, all  constitutional office-holders are to be placed first  in order of priority in the Table of the new  Warrant of Precedence; Thereafter the constitu-  tionally recognized and referred post-holders,  namely, District Judges and Chiefs of Staff of the  Defence Services of Bangladesh etc. are to be  placed in the said Table; albeit they are persons  +n the service of the Republic; Members of the    Judicial Service holding equivalent judicial posts    *Writ Petition No.11685 of 2006.       of District Judges are to be paced along with  District Judges at the jal number of the  Table; Since as per Article 152(1) of the Constitu-  tion, District Judge includes Additional District  Judge, Additional District Judges are to be     placed at the serial number immediately after  that of District Judges. see LOD)  <br>  New Warrant of Precedence  <br>  The respondent No.1 is directed to make a  new Warrant of Precedence in accordance with  the 8(eight) point directives mentioned in the  body of the judgment within a period of 60(sixty)  days from the date of receipt of a copy thereof  and to place the District Judges, Members of the  Judicial Service holding equivalent judicial posts  of the District Judges, Additional District Judges,  Chief Judicial Magistrates and Chief Metropoli-  tan Magistrates in appropriate places in the  Table of the new Warrant of Precedence. ....(102)    Precedence    As per the impugned Warrant of Precedence,  the Table will be observed with respect to the  precedence of persons named therein. So the  meaning of the word 'precedence' is very crucial  relating to the placement of the District Judges in  the said Table. 'Precedence' means the order or  priority in place or time observed by or for per-  sons of different status (such as political digni  taries) on the basis of rank during ceremonial  events and another meaning of the word is gen-  erally the act or state of going before something  else according to some system of priorities.    \"Precedence! means priority and that priori-  ly predicated upon  atus' is a per    ty is necessarily and essenti  one's status. The meaning 0  son's legal condition, whether personal or pr  etary; the sum total of a person's legal ri;  duties, liabilities and other legal relations, or a  particular group of them separately consi                     So while formulating or making the Table of the  Warrant of Precedence, the status of a fune-  tionary, either constitutional or public, cannot be  sneezed at. But in the impugned Warrant of  precedence some functionaries have been placed  far below others in derogation to their dignity,  status and priority.    Observations    Any revision of the impugned Warrant of  Precedence is required or if a question arises as  to framing of a new Warrant of Precedence alto-  gether, then the Prime Minster will have the final  say on the matter subject to any directions,  observations and findings given by the Court in  this case.

Accused-Petitioner  (MR Hasan) J vs   Md Abu Taher Khan and  <br>  December 10th, 2009 ' anr........Opposite Parties*       Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972  Article 31       ",
      "70. Regard being had to the facts and circum-  stances of the case, we are of the view that the  Criminal Appeal No. 3282 of 2001 filed by  Moazzem Hossain and Criminal Appeal being No.  3604 of 2001 filed by Nurul Islam succeed and  Criminal Appeal No. 3698 of 2001 filed by Khalil  @ Khalilur Rahman fails.    ",
      "69. In the light of the above mentioned facts  and circumstances of the case and evidence on  record, we are of the view that the allegation against  accused Khalil @ Khalilur Rahman has been proved  beyond all reasonable doubt.    ",
      "68. It further appears from the evidence of PW  14 Investigating Officer, Ruhul Amin who was offi-  cer-in-charge of Naogaon Police Station that getting  the message from Porsha police station regarding  dacoity of Saraigachhi Food Godown, he searched    the matter and came to know that looted goods were  kept in the rice mill of Mustafizur Rahman located  at Sahapur under Naogaon police station. He further  deposed that getting such information he along with  his force went to the godown of that mill and recov-  ered and seized 92 bags of looted rice from the north  and south sides of godown in presence of Alam and  Bablu. He further testified that there is writing of  Saraigachhi Food Godown on each bag and that he  seized the looted rice. Thus it appears from the  above evidence on record that the contents of con-  fessional statements are directly corroborated by the  recovery and seizing of looted rice of Saraigachhi  Food Godown with label and marks of that godown,  which cannot be denied at all. Generally dacoity is  a very heinous crime, particularly dacoity in the  instant case is more serious because it is the dacoity  in the government store which has been proved by  confessional statements of three co-accused and  which have been corroborated by direct evidence of  recovery of looted rice. The leamed Advocate for  the convict appellant fervently argued for decreas-  ing the term of punishment. Since allegation of  dacoity against appellant Khalil @ Khalilur Rahman  has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, we do  not fee inclined to decreasing the term of punish-  ment in such heinous crime like dacoity in the gov-  ermment store.    ",
      "67. Thus, it clearly appears from the above  confessional statements that Khalil @ Md Khalilur  Rahman directly participated in the commission of  dacoity and under his direction and presence, the  dacoity was committed.    ",
      "66. The confessing accused Abul Hossain who  is the truck driver clearly stated in his confessional  statement that the accused Khalil @ Khalilur  Rahman and Nurul Islam asked him to arrange some  labourers to give trip and accordingly he arranged  Lalu, Akram, Rustom and Samad and they started  for Naogaon as per their direction for giving the trip  of goods and they placed the truck at the door of the  godown No. 3 Saraigachhi and they took away  100/120 bags of rice and unloaded the rice in the  mill of accused Azimuddin. Confessing accused  Lalu who is one of the labourers of the said truck  corroborated the confessional statement of Abul  Hossain stating that as per the direction of Khalil  alias Khalilur Rahman and Nurul Islam, they placed  the truck at the door of Godown No. 3, Saraigachhi  and took away 100/120 bags of rice and unloaded  the same in the rice mill of accused Azimuddin. The  confessing accused Azimuddin, in his confessional  statement, stated that he purchased 90 bags of rice  from Imran through his relative Moazzem paying  Taka 90,500.    ",
      "65. Now let us see the evidence against the  convict appellant Khalil @ Khalilur Rahman.    ",
      "64. As regards the allegation against the con-  vict appellant Moazzem Hossain, there is a solitary  evidence that the accused Azimuddin purchased the  looted rice from accused Imran through his relative  accused Moazzem Hossain. No other witness has  mentioned his name any where in the evidence. So  such solitary evidence of confessing accused with-  out any corroboration cannot be the basis of convic-  tion. So he should be acquitted.    ",
      "63. No confessing accused mentioned the  name of Nurul Islam in their confessional statement.  There is no other evidence on record to connect him  with the occurrence. So he should be acquitted trom  the charge.                 ",
      "62. On perusal of the record, it appears that the  confessing accused Azad Hossain Lalu, Abul  Hossain and Azimuddin are not the appellants. It  appears that confessing accused Azimuddin has  been acquitted by the trial Court.    ",
      "60. It appears from evidence on record that  ingredients of section 395 of the Penal Code have  been proved, because it appears from the evidence  that 5 or 6 persons jointly committed the crime and  someone or more out of them committed or attempt-  ed to commit robbery, others were present and aided  the commission of dacoity.      ",
      "59. Now let us see whether the charges against  the convict appellants, namely Khalilur Rahman,  Moazzem Hossain and Nurul Islam, have been proved  in view of evidence and confessional statements.    ",
      "58. PW 8 Shahiduzzaman, Magistrate, First  Class, stoutly testified that the confessional  Statements of the accused persons are voluntary and  on enquiry accused persons clearly stated that they  are not tortured by the police, so it is clearly  revealed that confessional statements are true and  voluntary.    ",
      "57. Is it voluntary? Is it true?    On scrutiny of the confessional statements  made by the accused Abul Hossain, Azad Hossain  Lalu and Azimuddin it appears that the confessional  statements are true and voluntary.    ",
      "56. A confession is an admission made at any  time by a person charged with a crime, stating or  Suggesting the inference that he committed that  crime. A confession must either admit in terms the  offence, or at any rate substantially, all the facts  which constitute the offence. In order to decide  whether a statement is confessional or not, it must  be read as a whole. Prudence and justice demand  that such evidence cannot be made the sole ground  of conviction. It may be used only as a corrobora-  tive piece of evidence. The rule of prudence does  not require that each and every circumstance men-    tioned in the confession with regard to the participa-  tion of the accused person in the crime must be sep-    arately and independently corroborated, nor is it  essential that the corroboration must come from facts  and circumstances discovered after the confession  was made. Deliberate and voluntary confessions of  guilt, if clearly proved, are among the most effectual  proofs in law. The Court should apply two tests.    ",
      "55. A confession is relevant—  <br>  (1) if it is made after the impression caused  by any such inducement, threat or promise has  been fully removed.  <br>  (2) if it is not made to a police officer; or  <br>  (3) if it is made in the presence of a  Magistrate when the accused is in the custody  of a police officer.    ",
      "54. According to section 24 of the Evidence  Act, a confession by an accused is irrelevant if it is  caused by inducement, threat or promise.    ",
      "53. The confession of an accused person  against a co-accused is not evidence in the ordinary  sense of the term. Such a confession can only be  used to lend assurance to other evidence against a  co-accused. The judge may call in aid the confession  and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence.    ",
      "52. PW 8, Md Shahiduzzaman, Magistrate,  First Class, Naogaon deposed that observing all                 legal formalities, he recorded the confessional state-  ments of accused Azad Hossain Lalu and Abul  Hossain on 14-12-1994 and also recorded the con-  fessional statement of accused Azimuddin on 5-1-  1995 under section 164 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure which are made Exhibits 3, 4 and 5 and  he also identifies his signatures therein. He further  deposed that the confessional statements are volun-  tary and on inquiry, they replied that nobody tor-  tured them and that the confessional statements are  true and voluntary.    ",
      "51. Accused Azimuddin is another contes  accused who is a rice merchant. He made a conte:  sional statement that he purchased 99 bags of rice  from Imran through his relative Moazzem Hossain  paying Taka 90,500.    ",
      "50. Azad Hossain Lalu is another confessing  accused who is one of the labourers of that truck  who corroborating Abul Hossain gave the same ver-  sion,    ",
      "49. Accused Abul Hossain who is a truck driv-  er made confessional statement on 14-12-1994  before Md Shaiduzzaman, Magistrate, First Class,  narrating that accused Khalilur Rahman and Emran  asked him to arrange some labourers to give a trip  and accordingly, he arranged Lalu, Akram, Rustom  and Samad and started for Naogaon for giving trip.  On the way 4/5 persons got up in the truck and as  per their directions, they placed the truck at the door  of Godown No. 3 Saraigachhi Food Godown and  they took about 100/120 bags of rice and unloaded  the rice in the rice mills of Azimuddin.    ",
      "48. The accused Abul Hossain, Azimuddin and  Md Azad Hossain Lalu made confessional state-  ments implicating some accused persons.    ",
      "47. There is no mentioning of names of the  accused persons in the FIR.    ",
      "46. The allegations against the convict appel-  Jants are that they along with others committed  dacoity in No. 3 godown of Saraigachhi Food  Godown in the night following 10-12-1994 and  looted away 122 bags of rice worth Taka  1,10,678.40.    ",
      "45. Now let us see whether the charges of  offence under section 395 of the Penal Code have  been substantiated in view of the evidence on record  and in the light of principles of law formulated  under this section.    ",
      "44. There are three ingredients of this section:  <br>  1 . Five or more persons were jointly con-  cerned in the crime.  <br>  2 . One or more out of them committed or  attempted to commit robbery.  <br>  3 . Others were present and aided the com-  mission or attempt to commit robbery.    ",
      "43. For better appreciation, let us reproduce  section 395 of the Penal Code in the following lines:    Section 395; Punishment for Dacoity—  whoever commits dacoity shall be punished  with imprisonment for life or with rigorous  imprisonment for a term which may extend to  ten years, and shall also be alible to fine.\"    ",
      "42. It appears that convict appellants Nurul  Islam, Khalil @ Md Khalilur Rahman and Md  Moazzem Hossain were convicted under section  395 of the Penal Code.    ",
      "41. In the touchstone of above stated principles  of Criminal Jurisprudence, the points formulated are  being addressed.    ",
      "40. A Judge does not preside over a Criminal  Trial merely to see that no innocent person is pun-  ished. A judge also presides to see that a guilty man  does not escape. Both are public duties. A judge is  to sift grain out of chaff, Therefore, he cannot afford  any favour other than truth and only the truth,    ",
      "39. Fundamental _ principle  Jurisdiction is that onus of proving ever  essential to the establishment of charge  accused lies upon the prosecution which must prove  charge substantially as laid down i.e, to prove to the                   hilt beyond all reasonable doubt on strength of clear,  cogent, credible and unimpeachable evidence.  Proof of charge must depend upon judicial evalua-  tion of totality of evidence, oral and circumstantial,  and not by an isolated scrutiny of evidence.  Prosecution version is, also required to be judged  taking into account the overall circumstances of  case with a practical, pragmatic and reasonable  approach in the appreciation of evidence. It is  always to be remembered that the graver the charge,  the greater is the standard of proof required.    The doctrine of Presumption of Innocence is  always in favour of accused. The accused person  must be presumed to be innocent until the guilt is  proved by cogent and credible evidence.    ",
      "37. He stated in his cross-examination that  accused Azimuddin told him that he purchased the  seized rice.       ",
      "36. PW 14, Inspector Ruhul Amin who was  Officer-in-Charge Nogoaon Police Station on 12-  12-1994 . He deposed that getting a message from  Porsha Police Station regarding dacoity of  Saraigachhi Food Godown, he searched the matter  and came to know that dacoits kept the looted rice in  the rice mill of Mustafizur Rahman and the ricé mill  is located at New Sahapur under Naogaon police  station. He making a GD No. 367 dated 12-12-1994  went there and came to know that the godown of  that mill was owned by Azimuddin on rental basis.  He testified that they recovered and seized 92 bays  of looted rice from north, south side of that godown  as per the pointing out of Azimuddin in presence of  Md Alam and Bablu; that they arrested Azimuddin  through seizure list that there is writing of  Saraigachhi Food Godown on each bag of 1993-  1994; that the seizure list is marked Exhibit 3 and  his signature is marked as Exhibit 3/1; that on  enquiry, accused Azimuddin confessed his guilt and  as per his Statement he arrested accused Azad  Hossain and Mokbul and that he handed over the  accuseds and the looted goods to the Officer-in-  Charge, Porsha Police Station.    ",
      "35. PW 13, ASI Md Zahirul Hoque, who veri-  fies the names and addresses of Bachehu Miah and  others and their antecedents but found no other  cases excepting the case under review,    ",
      "34. He denied the defence suggestion that the  informant in collusion with Night Guard and  We 40    Sweeper misappropriated the alleged rice and that  the informant filed the case against the a  sons on false plea in order to save them    ",
      "33. In the cross-examination, he categorically  stated that the dacoits looted 122 bags of rice from  godown No, 3; there is a mentioning of Helal Rice  Mill and WQCP in the bag and that 16.55 metric  tonnes of rice were recovered from accused  Azimuddin in his presence.    ",

      "30. In the cross examination, he denied the  prosecution suggestion that police seized 95 bags of  rice in his presence, in the body of seized rice bags  there is written Saraigachhi Food Godown. He  admitted his signature in the seizure list.    ",

      "14. The only point for determination in these  appeals is, whether the learned Assistant Sessions  Judge, Naogaon was justified in convicting and sen-  tencing the accused appellants under section 395 of  the Penal Code.    ",
      "13. Mrs Umme Kulsum Begum, learned  Deputy Attorney-General along with Mr SM  Shahjahan Kabir, the learned Assistant Attorne:  General, for the State, on the other hand, submits  that the prosecution has proved its case against the  appellants by most consistent, corroborative, over-  whelming and competent witnesses; that the leamed  Assistant Sessions Judge, is quite justified in con-  victing and sentencing the appellants on the basis of  the most cogent and reliable evidence and that the  confessional statements are corroborated by the evi-  dence of other independent witnesses and that his  judgment does not suffer from any misreading and  non-reading of evidence. She further submits that  all the prosecution witnesses are natural, probable  and competent witnesses and there is no internal  points of falschood in their evidence on any point  and, as such, the impugned judgment calls for no  interference by this Court.    ",
      "12. Mr Aminul Huq Helal, the learned  Advocate for the appellant, cited the decision in the  case of Ustar Ali vs State reported in 3 BLC (AD) 53  in support of his contention.    ",
      "11. Mr Aminul Huq Helal, the learned  Advocate appeared on behalf of the appellant Khalil  @ Md Khalilur Rahman in Criminal Appeal No.  3698 of 2001, Mr Mamtaz Uddin Fakir, the learned  Advocate appeared on behalf of the appellant Md  Moazzem Hossain in Criminal Appeal No. 3282 of  2001 and Mr Kalipada Mridha, the learned  Advocate appeared on behalf of the appellant Md  Nurul Islam in Criminal Appeal No. 3604 of 2001  and took us through the FIR, charge sheet, charge so  framed, the deposition of the prosecution witnesses  and the impugned judgment and the materials avail-  able in the paper book and submit that the appellants  are innocent; that the informant in collusion with the  sweeper and night guard misappropriated 122 bags  of rice and that they have falsely implicated them in  order to save themselves. They further submit that  the trial Court failed to consider the evidence; that    /no independent and disinterested witnesses came to  depose in support of the prosecution case and the  witnesses who deposed are interested and partisan  witnesses and that the Court below illegally con-  victed the appellants on the basis of confessional    statements of the co-accused, ‘They further submit  that the confessional statements have not been cor-  roborated by the evidence of independent witnesses  and that the prosecution failed to prove the  against the accused beyond all reasonable doubt  that the impugned judgment and order of conviction  and sentence is bad in law as well as on fact and, as  such, the impugned judgment and order is liable to  be set aside.    ",
      "10. The accused appellants being aggrieved by  and dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence  dated 31-7-2001 passed by the learned Assistant  Sessions Judge, Naogaon in Sessions Case No. 51 of  1998 have come up with these appeals.    ",
      "9. Onconsideration of the evidence on record  gs well as the facts and circumstances of the case,  the leamed Assistant Sessions Judge, Naogaon  found the accuseds Nurul Islam, Khalil @ Khalilur  Rahman and Moazzem Hossain and 14 others guilty  under sections 395/412 of the Penal Code and con-  yicted them thereunder to suffer rigorous imprison-  ment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Taka 5000 in  default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three  months more.    ",
      "8. The defence case, as it transpires from the  trend of cross-examination of the PWs and the sug-  gestions put to the witnesses, in short, is that they                   are innocent. The further defence case is that the  informant in collusion with the sweeper and night  quand misappropriated 122 bags of rice and the  accused persons have been falsely implicated to  save themselves,    ",
      "7. After close of examination of the prosecu-  tion witnesses, the accused persons were examined  under section 342 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure to which they repeated their innocence  and the defence did not adduce any evidence on  their behalf.    ",
      "6. The prosecution examined 14 witnesses  who are cross-examined by the defence.    ",
      "5. After filing of the charge sheet, the case  was transmitted to the learned Sessions Judge,  Naogaon which was registered as Sessions Case No.  51 of 1998 and thereafter the case was transferred to  the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Naogaon, who  on the basis of the materials available on record |  framed charge against the accused persons under  sections 395/412 of the Penal Code and read it over  to the accuseds present in open Court to which they  pleaded not guilty and demanded trial.    ",
      "4. SI Saidur Rahman, took up the investiga.  tion, visited the place of occurrence, prepared the  sketch map with separate index of the place of  occurrence, examined the witnesses and recorded  their statements under section 161 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure and collected alamats,  Thereafter he submitted charge sheet being No. §  dated 8-3-1996 against the accused persons under  sections 395/412 of the Penal Code since the prima  Jacie case was made out against them.    ",
      "3. The prosecution case, in short, is that, on  10-12-1994 the informant Md Moslem Uddin  (Officer-in-Charge Saraigachhi Food Godown) after  completing his official duty at about 2-00 PM he  locked up the said godown's door and handed over  all responsibility to one Rezaul Karim who is the  guard of the godown; that on the following day at  about 8-00 AM the informant came to know from  Sharudar Ekram that 10/12 unknown persons com-  mitted dacoity at Food godown at about 1-00 at    night; that thereafter the informant went to the said  go down and found that the door of the go down No,  3 was broken and that the dacoits took away 12>  bags of rice from the go down and the price of the  looted goods is about Taka 1,10,678.40 . It is further  stated that after completing dacoity, the dacoits went  to Saraigachhi road and thereafter, guard and sweep.  cr informed the same to local people about the inci.  dent and that thereafter the local people and police  visited the place of occurrence and then informant  lodged the FIR.    ",
      "2. These appeals having sprouted up out of  the common Judgment dated 31-7-2001 in Sessions  Case No. 51 of 1998 arising out of Porsha Police  Station Case No. 1 dated 11-12-1994 and, as such,  these appeals are being heard and are being disposed  of by this single Judgment.    ",
      "25. The impugned proceedings of Tejgaon  Police Station Case No. 48 dated 21-7-2007 corre-  sponding to GR No. 573 of 2007 arising out of CR  (Petition Case) No. 1080 of 2007 under sections  406/408/ 409/ 420/34 of the Penal Code, now pend-  ing in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,  Dhaka against the accused petitioners is hereby  quashed.  <br>   Communicate a copy of this judgment to the  Court concerned where the case is now pending at  once.    Ed.   <br>                          HIGH COURT DIVISION <br> (Special Original Jurisdiction) <br> ABM Khairul Haque J) Bazlur Rahman (Md). <br>   Md Mamtazuddin | ........c.cceeeenee Petitioners <br> Ahmed J vs  <br>  Government of the Peo- <br> ple’s Republic of Bangla- <br> dest Respondents*  <br>  Judgment <br> July 15th, 2009 <br>    ",
      "24. In the result, the Rule is made absolute.    ",
      "23. So, we are of the considered view that the  decision of 60 DLR (AD) 1 is quite distinguishable  and not applicable in the facts and circumstances of  the instant case. As we have found that the pro-  ceedings of the instant case are barred by law, is  liable to be quashed even at the initial stage before  taking cognizance.    ",
      "22. The \"Doctrine of Stare Decisis\" postulates  that a long-standing decision of the Court which has  consistently been followed should not be upturned.  When a decision has been followed in several cases,  its binding effect should not be disturbed merely on  the ground that any particular aspect had not been  expressly considered therein. To support this view  we may refer to the case of Abdul Motaleb vs Iman  Ali Mollah reported in 42 DLR (AD) 123 wherein it  has been held that an established precedent handed  down by past judges.    ",
      "21. We are in respectful agreement with the  principles enunciated in 60 DLR (AD) I that a pro-  ceeding cannot be quashed unless cognizance js  taken thereof. Their Lordships while settling the  aforesaid principles discussed the earlier decisions  in the cases reported in 3/ DLR (AD) 69, 36 DLR  (AD) 14 and 48 DLR (AD) 87 . In those decisions the  proposition of law settled earlier that a proceeding  initiated if barred by law can be quashed even at ini-  tial stage, that his, at the stage of investigation has  not been disapproved.    ",
      "20. The case of Abdul Haque vs State reported  in 60 DLR (AD) | cited by the learned Deputy  Attomey-General, wherein the Appellate Division  has held as under:  <br>  \"Before taking cognizance of a case by the  competent Court or tribunal a proceeding can-  not be said to be pending and accordingly, a  proceeding cannot be quashed unless cog-  nizance in respect thereof has been taken and    process issued......... \"    ",
      "19. Pursuant to section 86 of the Ain, 2001 the  pesent complainant/informant had no lawful authori-  yt file a petition of complaint. Thus initiation of the  instant criminal case at the instance of the present  complainanvVinformant without taking recourse of the  procedures provided in Samabaya Samity Ain, 2001,  is not maintainable in law. Since initiation of the  instant case is barred by law, this Court in exercise of  its jurisdiction under section 561A of the CrPC can  quash the proceeding at its initial stage before taking  cognizance thereof. Our this view gets support from  the decision in the case of Kazi Forhad Hossain vs Md  Golam Mostafa Sarwar reported in 2007 BLD (AD)  47 wherein allowing quashment of the Proceedings, it  has been held as under:  <br>  - since the petition of complaint/  first information report contains allegations of  filing and use of forged document in the pro-  ceedings of a suit, the initiation of the criminal  proceeding for forgery at the instance of the  complainant petitioner without taking recourse  of the procedure provided in section 195(1)(c)  of the Code of Criminal Procedure is barred.”    ",
      "18. In the instant case it appears that for the  alleged offence of sale of the land of the society in  contravention of the constitution and by laws of the  Society and misappropriation of substantial part of  the consideration money by the accused petitioners  the complainant/ informant without invoking provi-  sions of the Samabaya Samity Ain, 2001 has filed  the petition of complaint in the Court of Chief  Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka who sent the peti-  tion of complaint to Tejgaon Police Station to treat  the same as first information report.    ",
      "17. On perusal of the petition of complaint  subsequently treated as first information report it  appears that allegations brought against the accused  petitioners that they sold the land of the  Metropolitan Christian Co-operative society Ltd in  contravention of the constitution of the said Society  and misappropriated a substantial part of the consid-  eration money to the tune of Taka 1,94,50,000 . The  alleged offence is punishable under section 83 of the  said Ain, 2001 . Rule 159 of Samabaya Samity  Bidhimala 2004 prescribes the procedures for  enquiry of the offence committed under section 83  of the Ain, 2001 . On enquiry if the allegation is  proved, the Registrar of the Co-operative Society or  any person authorised by him shall file a petition of  complaint in writing before the competent Court.                 ",
      "16. Section 86(1) of the aforesaid Ain 2001,  provides that any punishable offence relating to the  affairs of the co-operative society is non-cognizable  offence notwithstanding anything contained in the  Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 86(2) of the  Ain provides that no Court shall take cognizance of  any offence under the Ain 2001 without a written  complaint filed either by the Registrar of the Co-  operative Society or any person authorized by him.    ",
      "15. In the case in hand the question raised is that  the case is barred by law pursuant to section 86 of the  Samabaya Samity Ain, 2001 which reads as under:      ",
      "14. The consensus of judicial opinion is that  proceedings of a criminal case can be quashed by  the High Court Division in exercise of its inherent  jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code even at  initial stage when it appears that there is a legal bar  against the institution or continuance of the case.    ",
      "13. These views have consistently been  approved and followed by the Appellate Division in  the cases of Bangladesh vs Tan Kheng Hock report-  ed in 31 DLR (AD) 69, N Mahmud vs M Ahmed  reported in 36 DLR (AD) 14 = 1984 BLD (AD) 97,  Syed Mohammad Hashem alias Hashim reported in  48 DLR (AD) 87 and Faridul Alam vs State report-  ed in 6) DLR (AD) 93.    ",
      "12. In the case of Ali Akkas vs Enayet Hossain  reported in 1997 BLD (AD) 44 = 2 BLC (AD) 16  Appellate Division approving the aforesaid decision  reiterated the categories of following cases where  the High Court Division should interfere to quash a  criminal proceeding:  <br>  \"(1) Interference even at an initial stage  may be justified where the facts are so prepos-  terous that even on the admitted facts no case  can stands against the accused.  <br>  (2) Where institution or continuance of  criminal proceedings against an accused person  may amount an abuse of the process of the  Court or when the quashing of the impugned  proceedings would secure the ends of justice.  <br>  (3) Where there is a legal bar against insti-  tution or continuance of a criminal case against  accused persons. <br>   (4) In a case where the allegations in the  first information report or the complaint, even if  they are taken at their face value and accepted  in their entirety, do not constitute the offence  alleged and in such cases no question of weigh-  ing and appreciating evidence arises.  <br>  (5) The allegations made against the  accused person do constitute an offence alleged  but there is either no legal evidence adduced in  support of the case or the evidence adduced  clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.\"    ",
      "11. Appellate Division in several occasions  settled the scope of jurisdiction of the High Court  Division for quashment of a Criminal proceeding  under section 561A of the CrPC.   <br> In the case of Abdul Quader Chowdhury vs  State reported in 28 DLR (AD) 38 it has been held:  <br>  \"Interference even at initial stage may be  justified where the facts are so preposterous that  even on the admitted facts no case can stand  against the accused and that a further prolonga-  tion of the prosecution would amount to harass-  ment to an innocent party and abuse of process  of the Court. Besides, some categories of cases  may also be indicated where the inherent juris-  diction can and should be exercised for quash-  ing the proceeding. There may be cases where  it may be possible for the High Court to take the  view that the institution or continuation of crim-  inal proceedings against an accused person may  amount to the abuse of the process of the Court or  that the quashing of the impugned proceedings  would secure the ends of justice. If the criminal  proceeding in question is in respect of an offence  alleged to have been committed by an accused  person and it manifestly appears that there is a  legal bar against the institution or continuance of  the said proceedings the High Court would be  justified in quashing the proceedings on that  ground. Cases may also arise where the allega-  tions in the first information report or complaint  even if they are taken at their face value and  accepted in their entirety, do not constitute the  offence alleged, in such cases no question of  appreciating evidence arises, it is a matter of  merely looking at the complaint or first informa-  tion report to decide whether the offence alleged  is disclosed or not. In such cases it would be  legitimate for the High Court to hold that it would  be manifestly unjust to allow process of the crim-  inal Court to be issued against the accused per-  son. A third category of cases in which the inher-                 ent jurisdiction of the High Court can be invoked  may also arise, In cases falling under this  gory the allegations made against the accused  person do constitute an offence alleged but there  is either no legal evidence adduced in support of  the ease or the evidence adduced clearly or man-  ifestly fails to prove the charge,    ",
      "10. High Court Division under section 561A of  the Code of Criminal Procedure can exercise its  inherent jurisdiction for quashing a proceeding of a    criminal case firstly to make such orders as may be  necessary to give effect to any order of the Code,  secondly to prevent abuse of the process of the  Court and lastly otherwise to secure ends of justice,    ",
      "9. Before we proceed with the case we like to  quote the provision of section 561A of the Code of  Criminal Procedure to examine its scope which runs  as follows: <br>   \"561A. Nothing in this Code shall be  deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of  the High Court Division to make such orders as  may be necessary to give effect to any order  under this Code, or to prevent abuse of process of  any Court or otherwise to secure ends of justice.\"    ",
      "8. We have heard the submissions of the  learned Advocates and perused the first information  report annexed with the application for quashment.    ",
      "7. Mr Zahirul Haque Zahir, the learned  Deputy Attorney-General with Mr Md Abdul  Khaleque, Mr AKM Zahirul Haque and Ms  Sharmina Hug Assistant Attorney-General appear-  ing for the opposite party submits that in the instant  case police has not yet submitted the police report  concluding investigation and that since cognizance  has not been taken by the Court against the accused-  petitioners, there is no proceeding pending. He sub-  mits that as there is no proceeding pending against  the accused petitioners, question of quashment does  not arise presently. To support his submission he  referred to the decision in the case of Abdul Huque  vs State reported in 60 DLR (AD) J. He thus sub-  mits that the rule should be discharged on the  ground of pre-maturity.    ",
      "6. Mr Khair Ezaz Masood, the learned  Advocate with Mr Kazi Joynal Abedin, Advocate  appearing for the accused petitioners submits that  the accused petitioners are the office bearers and  general members of The Metropolitan Christian co-  operative Housing society Ltd (shortly the Society).  He submits that the accused petitioners transferred  the land according to the constitution and by laws of  the Society and approved by the Registrar of Co-  operative Society. He referring to sections 83 and  86 of Samabaya Samity Ain, 2001 and Rule 159 of  Samabaya Samity Bhidimala, 2004 submits that in  case of criminal offence relating to any co-operative  society being non-cognizable offence notwithstand-  ing any thing contained in the Code of Criminal  Procedure, no Court shall take cognizance of any  such offence without written complaint either from  the Registrar of the Co-operative Society or by any  person authorised by him. In the instant case the  complaint subsequently treated as first information  report filed by the complainant/ informant, a private  party, without any authority under the Samabaya  Samity Ain, 2001 . Thus he submits that since the  case is not maintainable being barred by law the pro-  ceeding can be quashed at its initial stage. He in  support of his contention cited the decisions in the  cases of Abdul Quader Chowdhury vs State reported  in 28 DLR (AD) 38, Nasiruddin Mahmud vs  Momtazuddin Ahmed reported in 36 DLR (AD) 14.  Faridul Alam vs State reported in 61 DLR (AD) 93.  Afia Khatoon vs Mobasswir Ali reported in 1995  BLT (AD) 74 = 47 DLR (AD) 62 State vs Lailun                   Nahar Ekram, reported in 2007 BLD (AD) 18 and  CN Rudramurthy vs Barkathullah Khan reported in  (1998) 8 SCC 275, He also submits that according  to the Doctrine of Stare Decisis a long standing  decision of the court which has been consistently  approved and followed by the Appellate Division in  the aforesaid decisions, should also be followed by  this Court, He thus finally submits that the instant  proceedings of the case is not maintainable against  the accused petitioners being barred by law and  should be quashed.    ",
      "5. The accused petitioners then moved this  Court with this application under section 561A of  the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the  impugned proceedings and obtained the rule on 24-  9-2007 and further proceedings of the case was  stayed.    ",
      "4. The learned Magistrate examining the  complainant under section 200 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure sent the petition of complaint to  the Officer-in-Charge of Tejgaon Police Station to    treat the same as first information report. On receipt  of the complaint it was recorded as Tejgaon Police  Station Case No. 48 dated 21-7-2007 under sections  406/408/409/420/34 of the Penal Code against the  accused petitioners. The accused petitioners were  enlarged on bail by this Court in Criminal  Miscellaneous Case No. 13056 of 2007.    ",
      "3. Dilip Piuri Fikeson (Lorance) as com-  plainant filed a petition of complaint on 10-6-2007  in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,  Dhaka against the accused petitioners alleging that  he is the Member being No. 884 of The Metropoli-  tan Christian Co-operative Housing Society Limited  of Church Community Centre, 9, Tejkuni Para,  Tejgaon, Dhaka. The said Society was formed in  1977 to solve the residential problems of its mem-  bers having about 8000 members presently who are  all beneficiary members. The accused persons are  fraud, cheat and commit criminal breach of trust of  entrustment of the property. While the accused per-  sons were discharging their functions as office bear-  ers of the managing committee of the said Society  from 2003 to 2006 took a decision on 17-9-2006 to  sell the property to out side in contravention of the  constitution of the ‘Society. On 18-10-2006 the  accused petitioner No. 1 and 3 sold 25.25 acres of  land of the Society at Mouza Kandar within police  station Mirpur to witness No. 1, Saiful Alam for a  consideration money of Taka 3,53,50,000 by exe-  cuting and registering the Sale Deed No. 8871 dated  18-10-2006 and handed over possession of the land  to the said purchaser, Saiful Alam. the accused peti-  tioner Nos. | and 3 deposited Taka 1,59,00,000 in  the Society and misappropriated the rest money of  Taka 1,94,50,000 . The complainant obtaining the  certified copy of the sale deed filed the case.    ",
      "2. At the time of issuance of the Rule, all fur-  ther proceedings of the case were stayed for a limit-  ed period, which subsequently has been extended  from time to time.    ",
      "1.   Initiation of the criminal case at the instance  of the present complainant/informant without  taking recourse of the procedures provided in  Samabaya Samity Ain, 2001, is not maintainable  in law. Since initiation of the case is barred by    law, this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction    *Criminal Miscellaneous case No. 14333 of 2008.    under section 561A of the Code of Criminal  Procedure can quash the proceeding at its initial    stage before taking cognizance thereof. ......

      "18.   Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Proce-  dure can exercise its inherent jurisdiction for  quashing a proceeding of a criminal case firstly  to make such orders as may be necessary to give  effect to any order of the Code, secondly to pre-  vent abuse of the process of the Court and lastly    otherwise to secure ends of justice. +(10)                                                 Samabaya Samity Ain (XLVI of 2001)  Sections 83 & 86  Samabaya Biddimala, 2004  Rule 159  Code of Criminal Procedure (Vv of 1898)  Section 561A      ",

      "15. Considering all these aspects, we are led to  hold that the Rule issued on the application under  section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is  not legally sustainable.    ",
      "14. We have also gone through the case deci-  sions reported in 1995 BLD (AD) 115 and 15 BLT  (AD) 185 where their Lordships held that there may  be rare cases where the High Court Division may be  justified in interfering even at the initial stage before  taking cognizance in the proceedings under section  561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But the  fact of those cases does not fall within the category  of the present one in any manner. There may be  rarest of rare cases, where no offence is at all dis-  closed and there is no shadow of doubt that allowing  continuation of the proceeding would be sheer abuse  of the process of the Court. We do not consider it to  be a case of such category to quash the proceeding  at the initial stage prior to the taking cognizance  against the accused-petitioner.    ",
      "13. We have also seen reported case of /3 MLR  (AD) 185 wherein proceeding for quashment of  criminal case has been discouraged holding the view  that before hearing under section 241A of the Code  of Criminal Procedure, a Criminal Proceeding is not  liable to be quashed.    ",
      "12. It is an admitted position of fact that cog-  nizance has not yet been taken in the connected  ACC GR case and Rule was issued during investi-  gation of this case. It is well settled by the various  decisions of our jurisdiction that criminal proceed-  ing can only be quashed after cognizance has been  taken and process issued on the accused persons.  The reason is that a criminal case actually starts  from the date of taking cognizance and issuance of    the process. Before cognizance is taken, there is Vire  tually no pending criminal proceeding in the eye of  law. So a non-existent criminal proceeding cannot  be subject matter of quashment. In this respect,  recent decision of our apex Court in the case of  Abdul Huque vs State reported in 60 DLR (AD) |  may profitably be quoted below:    \"Before taking of cognizance of a case by  the competent Court or Tribunal, a proceeding  cannot be said to be pending and accordingly, a  Proceeding cannot be quashed unless cog-  nizance in respect thereof has been taken and  Process issued\".    ",
      "11. So, we find existence prima-facie allega-  tion to start a criminal proceeding and there is no  substance in the submission that the FIR and prose-  cution materials do not disclose any criminal  offence. Therefore, the case decision referred to by  the leamed advocate for the accused-petitioner in  this respect have no manner of application in the  present case.    ",
      "10. It appears that subsequent to the issuance  of this Rule, investigation has been completed and  the Anti-Corruption Commission already prepared  charge sheet on 3-9-2008 to proceed against the  accused petitioner under sections 420/409 of the  Penal Code, The accused-petitioner has submitted  the certified copy of the charge sheet by filing sup-  plementary affidavit on 1-7-2009, It transpires trom                 the charge sheet that so many officials documents  were seized during investigation to prove the allega-  tion i.e, entrustment of the relief materials. More-  over, there are 17 cited witnesses including the con-  cemed officials. The trial Court is expected to go  through the materials at the time of hearing about  the charge under section 241A of the Code of  Criminal Procedure, The leamed Advocate for the  Anti-Corruption Commission has submitted copy of  TRS ALG? Vs Fe/Qoov/Aeo Tikes 92-v-Q000  issued by the Circle Officer, Tejgaon Development  Circle, Dhaka, to show that the accused-petitioner  was allotted 1686 bundles of Dhautin, which were  handed over to the accused-petitioner as well. This  is one of so many documents, which appear to have  been seized by the Investigation officer, and the  seized alamats disclose the allegation of entrustment  and cheating. Therefore, it is difficult to accept con-  tention of the learned Advocate appearing on behalf  of the accused-petitioner that there is no element in  the allegation attracting the offences alleged with. It  is evident from the investigation report that when  the accused-petitioner was a Member of the Parlia-  ment from the Dhaka 4 constituency, he was handed    over 1686 bundles Dheutin for the purpose of distri-,    bution but allegedly, he mis-appropriated those  relief materials.    ",
      "9. Pertinent question raised in the case is to  examine whether FIR discloses any fact attracting  elements of the offences under sections 420/409 of  the Penal Code or not. Admittedly, the accused-  petitioner was a Member of the Parliament from the  Dhaka 4 constituency, in the immediate passed Par-  liament of the Care Taker Government, 2007-2008.    There is clear allegation in the FIR (Annexure-A)     that the accused-petitioner misappropriated the  seized relief materials by using the same to serve his  personal purpose and those were recovered from his  house No, 189, Shyampur High School Road, Block  No.G, Shyamput, Dhaka. About 360 pieces of relief  CI sheets were recovered from the house belonging  to the petitioner according to the FIR. After collect-  ing those relief tins from the roof of the said house,  those were kept on the road running in front of that  house and the police seized those materials there-  from by preparing seizure list in presence of wit-  nesses. So, there is hardly any substance in this sub-  mission that the place of seizure being a public road,  the accused petitioner cannot be made responsible  for misappropriation of those relief materials as he  was not found in possession of those relief materi-  als. It is evident from the FIR that there is allegation  in the following manner:      It is, however, not very clear from the FIR as to  whether the seized relief materials were given to the  accused-petitioner as representative of the people of  the locality for distribution amongst the deserving  poor persons. Such question of entrustment can only  be look into by the trial Court on examining investi-  gation materials available in the case docket and  also through trial. We have no opportunity to look  into the case docket in the present forum and there  is also little scope to deal with such controversial  facts.    ",
      "8. So far merit of the case is concerned, the  leamed Advocate submits further that there is alle-  gation in the FIR that the accused petitioner, being  local Member of the Parliament, ( a Public Servant),  misappropriated the relief materials which were  entrusted on him for distribution, used the same for  his own house and those materials were recovered  therefrom. It is asserted that sufficient materials  were collected during investigation to initiate a cri-  minal proceeding against the accused-petitioner, but  those are not available here. There is, however,  scope for the trial Court to examine those materials  at the time of charge hearing. So, there is hardly any  scope to quash a criminal proceeding at the very ini-  tial stage, when cognizance is yet to be taken.    ",
      "7. Mr MA Aziz Khan, the leamed Advocate  appearing on behalf of the opposite party No, 2  (Anti-Corruption Commission), submits in reply,  that before taking cognizance, no criminal case, in  effect, starts; and, as such, the application under see-  tion 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for  quashment of such proceeding is premature and it is  at all not maintainable on this ground alone. It is  contended that no investigation process should be                 hindered at the initial stage of criminal case by ini-  tiating a quashment proceeding like the present one.  In this respect, the learned Advocate has relief upon  the case of Abdul Huque vs State reported in 60 DLR  (AD) 1 . He submits that the accused-petitioner shall  get sufficient opportunity to place his grievance, if  any, at the time of taking cognizance as well as  framing of charge, when it would be possible to  examine investigation materials available in the case  dockets. When there are stages open before the trial  Court to consider the grounds taken, the application  for quashment of the proceeding, being an inherent  jurisdiction of the Highest Court, should not be  entertained. In support of his contention, the  learned advocate has also cited the case of Nazrul  Islam vs State reported in 13 MLR (AD) 185, where  their Lordships have taken the view that where alter-'  native remedy is available before any other forum,  the criminal proceedings are not at all liable to be  quashed at least prior to stage of hearing under sec-  tion 241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.    ",
      "6. With reference to the case decisions repor-  ed in 50 DLR 551 and 52 DLR 105, the learned  Advocate submits that when the allegations does not  disclose any offence of cheating and criminal breach  of trust, the accused-petitioner should not be com-  pelled to wait till hearing of charge under section  241A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He sub-  mits that there is no legal bar for quashment of the  proceedings at the initial stage of the investigation  in order to prevent abuse of the process of the Court.  In support of his contention, the leamed Advocate  has referred to the case of Syed Md Hashem vs State  reported in /995 BLD (AD) 115 = 48 DLR (AD) 87  and also the case of State vs Lailun Nahar Ekram  reported in 15 BLT (AD) 185 . So, he contends that  quashment of the case before taking cognizance  cannot be treated as premature one.    ",
      "5. MrAM Mahbub Uddin, the learned Advo-  cate appearing on behalf of the accused-petitioner,  submits that the allegation brought against the for-  mer member of the Parliament was politically moti-  vated only for harassment and humiliation. The  alleged recovery of relief materials was made on 22-  11-2007 when the accused-petitioner was in cus-  tody. It is contended that the relief materials were  seized from the road, a public place, and not from  the possession of the accused-petitioner. It is further    contended that the accused-petitioner was never  entrusted to deal with the relief materials, rather the  local authority for allotment and distribution of  those relief materials were responsible for misap-  propriation, if any. He submits that the local  Government officials were in fact entrusted with the  responsibility of giving allotment and distributes  those relief materials amongst the local poor deserv-  ing people. It is further submitted that as an elected  Member of the Parliament from the local area, the  accused-petitioner Alhaj Salauddin Ahmed might  have only recommended for such allotment, but he  was never entrusted with the property. So, the ques-  tion of criminal breach of trust does not arise at all,  so far he is concerned. According to his submis-  sions, there is no material in the record to show that  the accused-petitioner was given authority for distri-  bution of such relief materials.    ",
      "4. Since the allegations were under schedule  offence of the Anti-Corruption Act, 2004, when the  case was under investigation by the officer of the  Anti-Corruption Commission, an application under  section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure  was moved and this Rule was issued and stay passed  as stated above. The accused-petitioner was also  granted adinterim bail by the same Rule issuing  order dated 14-8-2008.    ",
      "3. The faets relevant for the purpose of dispo-  sal of the Rule are that Mr Mozammel Haque, Sub-  Inspector of Police Shyampur Police Station lodged  FIR. bringing allegations that on 22-11-2007 he  along with other members of the joint forces recov-  ered in all 360 pieces of corrugated tin (Dheutin),  which were allotted for distribution as relief materi-  als and not for sale, from the house No, 189 Shyam-  pur High School road, block No. G under the police  station Shyampur, Dhaka belonging to the owner-  ship of the accused-petitioner Al-haj Salahuddin  Ahmed, a former Member of the Parliament. Those  relief corrugated tins were found affixed on the roof  of the accused petitioner's house and those were  brought down with the road with the help of the  labour and thereafter seized therefrom in presence  of the local witnesses. The accused-petitioner pro-  cured those relief materials for distribution amongst  the local poor people, but fraudulently misappropri-  ated the same and used in his own house. Accord-  ingly, the accused-petitioner committed offence  under sections 420/409 of the Penal Code.    ",
      "2. By the said Rule issuing order all further of  proceedings of the aforesaid case were stayed,    ",
      "1. Quashing of proceeding, not before cogni-  zance is taken—A criminal case actually starts  from the date of taking cognizance and issuance  of the process. Before cognizance is taken, there  is virtually no pending criminal proceeding in the  eye of law. So a non-existent criminal proceeding  cannot be subject matter of quashment. In this  respect, decision of our apex Court in the case of  Abdul Huque vs State reported in 60 DLR (AD) 1  may profitably be quoted.    Abdul Huque vs State 60 DLR (AD) 1; Abdul Hai vs  State 50 DLR 551; Habib vs State 52 DLR 105; SM Has-  hem vs State 1995 BLD (AD) 115 = 48 DLR (AD) 87;  State vs Lailun Nahar Ekram 15 BLT (AD) 185= 62 DLR  (AD) 283 & Nazrul Islam vs State 13 MLR (AD) 185 ref.

      "25. The order of stay granted earlier by this  Court shall stand vacated.    Communicate the order at once.

      "24. Accordingly, we find no merit in this Rule  and the Rule is hereby discharged. The trial Court  is directed to proceed with the case as expeditiously  as may be practicable.    ",
      "23. Mere contention that, an impugned pro-  ceedings amounts to abuse of the process of the    Court, without there being any basis or material to  substantiate such contention does not warrant inter  ference by this Court under section 561A.    ",
      "22. Even looking at this case from that point of  view, we do not find that the accused has in any way  been misled or that framing of one charge for dis-  honouring of 3(three) cheques, in the manner afore-  said, has occasioned a failure of justice. Indeed, no  such contention has been made before us by the  learned Counsel for the petitioner.                 ",
      "21. We have also considered that the provi-  sions regarding framing of charges has been incor-  porated under Chapter XIX of the Code of Criminal  Procedure. Section 225 of the Code reads as fol-  lows:  <br>  \"225, Effect of Errors: No error in stating  either the offence or the particulars required to  be stated in the charge, and no omission to state  the offence or those particulars shall be regard-  ed at any stage of the case as material, unless  the accused was in fact, misled by such error or  omission, and it has occasioned a failure of jus-  tice.\"    ",
      "20. Section 141, clause (c) of the Negotiable  Instruments Act has provided for trial of such case  by a senior Court, namely the Court of Sessions.  Thereafter, by a subsequent amendment dated 9-2-    2006, the carlier section 138 A, regarding filing of    appeal against the judgment of the trial Court, has    also been replaced and substituted by a new section    138A of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In the new    section, restriction has been imposed in preferring    appeal against the judgment of the trial Court.    Unless an amount not less then 50% of the amount    of the dishonoured cheque is deposited before filing    the appeal in the Court which awarded the sentence,    no appeal would be admissible. As such, the inten-    tion of the legislature is very much clear that, the  Negotiable Instruments Act, being a special law and  special provision being made to restrain lingering of  the disposal of such cases and also to discourage  preferring frivolous appeals. This piece of legisla-  tion by its nature is a beneficial one and the cheque-  defaulter should not be indulged in a manner so that  the legislative intent is allowed to be frustrated.    ",
      "19. We have also considered the unreported  decision cited by the learned Counsel for the peti-  tioner and we are unable to agree with reasoning by  “eir Lordships given in the said case.       ",
      "18. It is, therefore, abundantly clear that for  each cause of action, whether arises for failure to  pay the amount due under a single cheque or for  more than one cheque, depending upon the amount  chimed there should be a single petition of com-  plaint. In this case, since, in the demand notice the  total amount of the 3(three) cheques amounting to  Joka 12,84,600 has been demanded and the drawer  ofthe cheque having failed to make payment of the  \"said amount of money\" within 30 days, only one  cause of action has arisen and, legally, for one cause  of action there should be one complaint petition,  which has exactly been done in the impugned pro-  ceeding. As such, we do not find any illegality or  any abuse of the process of the Court in issuing a  single notice for 3(three) cheques, as because notice  has been served and the demand has been made  within the stipulated period of time. We also find  support of our views from the case between Stalion  Shox (Pvt) vs Auto Teisions (Pvt) Ltd reported in  (1994) 79 Company Cases 809 (Delthi), wherein the  honourable Court has declined to quash a similar  complaint petition under section 561A of the CrPC  as because the petitioner could not point out any  prejudice to be cause to the petitioners by filing of  one complaint in respect of dishonouring of 11  cheques. Besides a decision cited by the learned  Counsel for the opposite party No. 1, reported in 6/  DLR 386, Zahid Hossen vs State, also supports our  view, in which the complainant issued a single  notice of demand for 8(eight) dishonoured cheques  and initiated a single proceedings and the petition  for quashment challenging the said proceedings  failed.    ",
      "17. Thereafter, considering sub-section (1) of  section 138 along with clause (b) of section 141 of  the Negotiable Instruments Act, we further find that  clause (b) of section 141 makes provision for filing  the complaint within one month of the date on  which the \"cause of action\" arises under clause (c)  of section 138(1) of the Act. Apparently, this section  141 also does not contemplate more than one cause  of action, while it is now settled that cause of action  under clause (c) of section 138 (1) arises once the  payee fails to pay the amount demanded within 30  days of receiving the notice. Rather clause (b) of  section 141, read with sub-section (1) of section 138  of the Negotiable Instruments Act, clearly signifies  that dishonour of a cheque per se would not bring  the drawer of the dishonoured cheque within the  mischief of sub-section (1) of section 138 . There  must have arisen a cause of action for taking cog-  nizance under clause (1) of section 141 of the Act  Such cause of action arises upon failure of the draw-                   er of cheque to make payment of \"the amount of  money\", Within 30 days of receiving the notice  demanding payment of the amount under the dis-  honoured cheque and not within 30 days of dishon-  our of a cheque.    ",
      "16. Looking at the provision, as laid down in  clause (b), we find that the notice of demand con-  templated in clause (b) requires demanding the  “amount of money\" due under the dishonoured  cheque. Similarly, clause (c) of section 138(1), also  stipulates that if the drawer of the cheque fails to  make the payment of the \"said amount of money\" to  the payee, then cause of action to lodge a complaint  petition would arise. The emphasis put under clause  (b) and (c), quoted above, is on the obligation of the  drawer to pay the \"amount of the money\" which he  is liable to pay under the cheque or cheques drawn  by him. No where in clause (b) or (c) of sub-section  (1) of section 138 of the Act, it has been stipulated  or in any way been required that for each cheque  there should be a separate notice. The expression  “said amount of money\", as used in clauses (b) and  (c) as quoted above, may cover the amount of  money that may be due under only one dishonored  cheque as well as the amount of money due under  more than one dishonoured cheque. The duty of the  payee is to demand the ‘amount of money’ due to    him and that may be due under one or more than one  dishonoured cheques and not to issue a separate or  distinct notice for cach dishonoured cheque, if there  are more than one such dishonoured cheques. As  such, we are of the considered view that, in case of  dishonour of more than of cheque, it is the discretion  or convenience of the payee to decide as to whether  he should issue a single notice or more than one  notice for each cheque. This may well depend upon  several considerations like the need of the payee, the  time gap between the cheques and the payee's desire  to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, excessive legal  cost and delay in the disposal of a case, etc. But, the  legislature cannot be inflicted with the intent to  require the payee to resort to multiplicity of pro-  ceedings, if the payee considers one proceeding js  practicable or otherwise advisable, in case he hap-  pens to be the payee of several cheques drawn in his  favour by the same drawer. Any other interpretation  of section 138 (1) of the NI Act would not only frus-  trate the intent and purport of a piece of beneficial  legislation like this, rather would be absurd and con-  tradictory to the express provision of section 138(1)  of the Act.    ",
      "15. To arrive at our conclusion, we have con-  sidered section 138 along with section 141 of the                 Negotiable Instruments Act. Clauses (a) (b) and (c)  of sub-section (1) of section 138 reads as follows:  <br>  \"(a) the cheque has been presented to the  bank within a period of six months from:  the date on which it is drawn or within  the period of its validity, whichever is  earlier;  <br>  (b) the payee or the holder in due course of  the cheque, as the case may be, makes a  demand for the payment of the said  amount of money by giving a notice, in  writing to the drawer of the cheque,  within thirty days of the receipt of infor-  mation by him from the bank regarding    the return of the cheque as unpaid, and  <br>  (c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make  the payment of the said amount of  money to the payee or, as the case may  be, to the holder in due course of the  cheque, within thirty days of the receipt  of the said notice.\"    ",
      "14. Now the only question that falls for our  determination is, whether a single notice can be  issued for dishonour of 3(three) cheques. In other  words, whether the initiation or continuation of the  impugned proceedings for dishonour of 3(three)  cheques in any way amounts to abuse of the process  of the Court,    ",
      "13. It further appears from the complaint peti-  tion thus annexed that, the said 3(three) cheques  being dishonoured for insufficiency of fund, a single  notice of demand had been issued upon the accused,  well within time, as per clause (b) of sub-section (1)  of section 138 of the NI Act, and the accused, be:  the drawer of the cheque, having failed to make the  payment of the \"said amount of money\" to the  payee, (the complainant), within 30 days of receiv-  ing the notice of demand, as stipulated in clause (c)  of sub-section (1) of section 138, cause of action has  arisen to lodge a complaint petition as per provision  of section 141(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act  and a complaint has accordingly been filed within  the statutory period as mentioned in clause (b) of  section 141 . As such, as it appears from record, the  complainant has complied with all the legal formal-  ities as laid down in section 138 and 141 of the  Negotiable Instruments Act, for lodging the com-  plaint petition. We, therefore, have found no ille-  gality in lodging the complaint petition, in the man-  ner as it has been filed.    ",
      "11. Thereafter, a single notice demanding pay-  nent of the total amount of the 3(three) cheques,  mounting to Taka 12,84,600, was issued on 19-4-  007, as per clause (b) of section 138 (1) of the NI  \\c, within the statutory period. But the accused  ‘failed to make the payment of the said amount    fof Taka 12,84,600, within 30 days, in spite of his  having received the notice.        ",
      "10. It appears that, to secure payment of his  business liability, the accused has drawn, in favour  of the complainant 3(three) cheques, Nos. 2172956,  2172957 and 2172958 and dated on 19-12-2006, 24-  12-2006 and 30-3-2007 respectively. All these  cheques were placed several times for honour and  finally on 3-4-2007 and 15-4-2007, but each time  the cheques were dishonoured for insufficient fund.    ",
      "9. Point for decisions in this case is, whether  filing of the complaint based on single notice for  3 (three) cheques and continuation of the proceed-  ings under section 138 of the Negotiable Instru-  ments Act amounts to abuse of the process of the  Cour.    ",
      "8. The learned Advocate also submits that, the  proceeding before this Court under section 561A of  the Code of Criminal Procedure has been initiated  for callatal purpose to cause delay in the disposal of  the complaint petition pending before the trial  Court, not to secure ends of justice. As such the  accused-petitioner has not come in clean hands and  he is not entitled to have any shelter of this Court  under section 561A, In support of his contention,  the leamed Counsel has cited the case between  Zahid Hossain vs State, reported in 61 DLR 386.    ",
      "7. Mr SM Shahjahan along with Mr Mé  Shafiqur Rahman, learned Advocates appearing for  the opposite party No. | drawing our attention tothe  complaint petition, annexed as Annexure-\"A\" to the  petition under section 561A, mainly submits thé  there is no legal bar under section 138 of the  Negotiable Instruments Act in issuing a single  notice for dishonor of 3(three) cheques or in lodgin:  a single petition of complaint, if the demand made in  the said notice is not satisfied within the statutoy  period of 30 days of receiving the notice. He also  submits that, all the 3(three) cheques were present-  ed for honour well within time, that is betore  becoming stale and the notice of demand, as con-  templated under section 138(1)(b), has also been  issued well within the statutory period and that                 thereafter the complaint petition has also been  lodged as per section 141(1) of the NI Act within the  time preseribed by the law, He further submits that  in this case, a single notice of demand being served  for all the 3(three) cheques and the demand being.  mt satisfied, there has arisen a single cause of action  fur lodging a single complaint, as contemplated  wiler section 141(1) of the Negotiable Instruments  act. As such, there was no illegality in lodging one  complaint petition based on the single cause     ",
      "6. Dr Rafiqur Rahman, the learned Senio;  Counsel, appearing for the accused-petitioner main.  ly submits that the complainant having served singl,  notice dated 19-4-2007 for 3(three) cheques, hence  the proceedings initiated thereupon is not sustain.  able in law and that the continuation of the said  proceedings under section 138 of the Negotiabl;  instruments Act is a sheer abuse of the process o/  the Court. In support of his contention, the learned  Counsel has cited before us an unreported decision  given by another bench of the High Court Divisio;  in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 15742 of  2005.    ",
      "5. The said transferee Court has framed ;  charge against the accused-petitioner under section;  138 and 141, Negotiable Instruments Act fixing |].  8-2008 for hearing. At this stage the accused-peti.  tioner has moved the above mentioned petition  under section 561A of the Code of Crimina|  Procedure and obtained the instant Rule.    ",
      "3. Upon receiving the complaint petition the  Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka took cog-  nizance of the case on 3-6-2007, against the peti-  tioner, under section 138 of the NI Act. Thereafter  the accused petitioner surrendered on 19-12-2007    before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka,  and obtained bail.    sion Judge, Dhaka wherein,  it has been registered as Sessions Case No. 790 of  2008 and the case was ultimately sent to the learned    Joint Metropolitan Sessions Judge, 5th Court,  Dhaka for trial.    ",
      "2. The case of the complainant-opposite party  No. 1, in short, is that the complainant has filed a  petition of complaint before the Chief Metropolitan  Magistrate, Dhaka against the petitioner, on 3-6-  2007, under section 138 of the Negotiable Instru-  ments Act, 1881 (The NI Act) stating that, the, com-  plainant is an established businessman of rod and  cement. The accused petitioner is the proprietor of  Messrs Global Intemational and used to purchase  rod and cement from the complainant and in the  course of business they got acquainted with each  other. Taking advantage of this acquaintance, the  accused had been able to earn trust of the com-  plainant. In this way the accused petitioner, on dif-  ferent dates, took on credit rod and cement from the  complainant worth Taka 13,74,429 and to discharge  the said liability the accused-petitioner had drawn 3  cheques numbering 2172956, 2172957 and 2172958  dated 19-12-2006, 24-12-2006 and 30-3-2007  respectively, in favour of the complainant, for an  amount of Taka 12,84,600 in total. The cheques  were presented for encashment on different dates,  but the same were dishonoured for insufficient  funds and the fact of repeated dishonour of the  cheques were duly informed to the accused-petition-  er. The cheques were lastly dishonoured on 3-4-  2007 and 15-4-2007 . Hence, the complainant had  issued, upon the accused, a demand notice dated 19-  4-2007, under section 138 of the NI Act, and  demanded payment of Taka 12,84,600, being the  amount due under the said 3(three) cheques, within  30 days of the receipt of the demand notice, hence  the complainant filed on 3-6-2007, a petition under  section 138 of the NI Act.    ",
      "1. Cause of action—clause (b) of section 141,  read with sub-section (1) of section 138 of the Act,  clearly signifies that dishonour of a cheque per se  would not bring the drawer of the dishonoured  cheque within the mischief of sub-section (1) of  section 138 . There must have arisen a cause of  action for taking cognizance under clause (1) of  section 141 of the Act. Such cause of action aris-  €s upon failure of the drawer of cheque to make    *Criminal Miscellaneous Case No, 12635 of 2008.    Payment of \"the amount of money\", within 30  days of receiving the notice demanding payment  of the amount under the dishonoured cheque and  not within 30 days of dishonour of a cheque.     Cause of action Complaint petition—Since,  in the demand notice the total amount of the  3(three) cheques amounting to Taka 12,84,600  has been demanded and the drawer of the cheque  having failed to make payment of the \"said  amount of money\" within 30 days, only one cause  of action has arisen and, legally, for one cause of  action there should be one complaint petition,  which has exactly been done in the impugned  proceeding.    As such, we do not find any illegality or any abuse  of the process of the Court in issuing a single notice for  3(three) cheques, as because notice has been served and  the demand has been made within the stipulated period of  time.

      "20. In the result these two Rules are made  absolute without any order as to the costs.    ",
      "19. The discussion made above and the facts  and circumstances of the case and also the legal  position of the case the impugned judgment and  decree dated 25-1-2006 and 31-1-2006 respectively  passed by the leamed Joint District Judge, Ist Court,  Feni, in Title Appeal Nos.113 of 2004 and 114 of  2004 allowing the appeals and reversing the judg-  ment and decree dated 20-10-2004 and 27-10-2004  respectively passed by the learned Senior Assistant  Judge, Parshuram, Feni, in Title Suit Nos. 29 of  2003 decreeing the Title Suit No.8 of 2004 is here-  by set aside and the judgment and decree passed by  the trial Court is hereby affirmed.    ",
      "18. In view of the facts and legal position of  the case I find that the lower appellate Court is  absolutely wrong in reversing the judgment and  decree passed by the trial Court, as such, the judg.  ment and decree passed by the lower appellate Cour  is liable to be set aside.    ",
      "17. Another decision can also be cited in the  case of Habibullah vs Sher Ali Khan reported in 57  DLR (AD) 55 wherein it has been stated:  <br>  \"The High Court Division while exercising  its revisional jurisdiction is competent to    reverse the judgment of the Courts below when  the same has been made either upon mis-read.  ing or non-consideration of the material evi-  dence causing failure of justice.”    ",
      "16. In judgment of the trial Court it appears  that in its finding the said Court carefully considered  the material evidence on record. The learned trial  Court did not commit any error of law and also com-  mitted no illegality in arriving at his finding because  the plaintiff Dr Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury  could be able to prove the case successfully. The  lower appellate Court committed an error of law and  came to a wrong finding occasioning failure of jus-  tice in not considering the documentary evidence,  exhibits and other vital documents. The appellate  Court being guided by emotion and sentiment  passed the judgment without the legal basis. The  appellate Court ought to have considered whether  the deed of gift was duly executed and registered  and acted upon and the validity of the deed of gift  and also whether the title was passed by this deed of  gift or not. Without determining’ this vital legal  aspect of the case the appellate Court reversed the  judgment and decree passed by the trial Court which  is liable to be set aside. In this connection I like to  rely on the case of Hussain Ahmed Chowdhury vs  Md Nurul Amin reported in 47 DLR (AD) 162  wherein it has been held :  <br>  \"If there is misreading of evidence and  non-consideration of some material evidence  then it was incumbent on the revisional Court to  consider the same and to arrive at a proper find-  ing on the material evidence on record and to  finally dispose of the case.\"    ",
      "15. On a meticulous examination of the  records, exhibits, documents and the judgment of  both the Courts below and also the connected papers  it appears that the trial Court discussed the evidence  on record and also perused the documents and  exhibits and considered the material evidence and  made his observation. It further appears from the  judgment of both the Courts below that the lower  appellate Court in reversing the judgment of the trial  Court did not refer the evidence on record and the  contents of the finding of the trial Court with refer-  ence to the evidence on record, The decision which  was referred by the appellate Court is not applicable  in the facts and circumstances of the instant case.  The lower appellate Court totally ignored the legal  aspect of the case and being guided by emotion and  sentiment passed the judgment of reversal without  any cogent and justified reason or ground. The  appellate Court while reversing the judgment of the  trial Court required to reverse the material finding of                   the trial Court with reference to the evidence on  record. In this connection I like to refer the decision  in the case of Mohsena Khatun vs Habib Knitting  Mills reported in 1997 BLD (AD) 47 wherein it has  been held: \"While reversing the judgment of the trial  Court the appellate Court is required to reverse the  material findings of the trial Court with reference to  the evidence on record.”    ",
      "14. Next he submits that the lower appellate  Court rightly observed that the plaintiff of Title Suit  No. 8 of 2004 Dr Md Jahangir Alam creating pres-  sure of giving notice of Talak in a deceitful manner  obtained the gift deed from his wife on 29-11-2001.  This gift deed in the eye of law has got no value and  liable to be cancelled under section 39 of the  Specific Relief Act. The learned Counsel finally  submits that the lower appellate Court after consid-  ering the facts and circumstances of the case and  also discussing the evidence came to a right and jus-  tified finding in allowing the appeals and reversing  the judgment and decree which is not liable to be  interfered by this Court in revision under section  115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.    ",
      "13. On the other hand, the learned Counsel Mr  Abul Kalam Chowdhury with Mr AT Obaidul Hye,  appearing on behalf of the opposite party No. 1, sub-  mits that the lower appellate Court was absolutely  correct and justified in allowing the appeals and  reversing the judgment and decree passed by the    trial Court. In this connection he referred the case  which was also cited in the judgment of the lower  appellate Court in Title Suit No. 29 of 2003 6 DLR  (AD) 97 wherein it has been stated that:  <br>  \"Initial onus of undue influence is on the  person who raises the plea—Initial onus with-  out discharge, the burden shifis on the other  side to prove the contrary\".    ",
      "12. The learned Counsel Mr Md Oziullah,  appearing on behalf of the plaintiff-respondent-peti-  tioner in Civil Revision No. 661 of 2006 and defen-  dant-respondent-petitioner in Civil Revision No.  662 of 2006 submits that the lower appellate Court  is absolutely wrong and erroneous in allowing the  appeals and reversing the judgment and decree  passed by the learned trial Court, the learned  Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni on consideration  of the evidence on records, documents, exhibits and  other connected papers passed in the judgment and  decree in favour of the petitioner Dr Md Jahangir  Alam which was absolutely proper and justified.  The learned Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram,  Feni observed that the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 8 of  2004 Dr Md Jahangir Alam has been able to prove  the case that the deed of gift was duly executed and  registered in pursuance of terms and conditions of  Salish held in Feni Bar Association Building in  presence of the plaintiff Dr Md Jahangir Alam and  his wife defendant Most Kamrun Nahar, her brother  Manjur Wahab and two Advocates Mr Md Nurul  Amin and Saidul Hoque of Feni Bar Association and  all of them were signatories of the Salishnama.  According to the decision of the Salish, plaintiff Dr  Md Jahangir Alam withdraw the Talak notice and  defendant Most. Kamrun Nahar also executed a  deed of gift of 3'/, decimal of land and the document  was duly registered on 29-11-2001 and the posses-  sion of the suit land was also duly delivered to the  plaintiff. Thereafter plaintiff Dr Md Jahangir Alam  for constructing a three-storied building submitted a  plan in the Feni Municipality for approval and  deposited the necessary fees in his name and after  approval he constructed a three storied building by  his own expense. He set up Feni Eye Clinic in the    ground floor of that building and set up his chambe,    in the first floor and started his roaring practice and  he along with his wife and children used to live jn  the 2nd floor of the building. In this way they were  living peacefully and harmoniously in their conjugay  life in the newly constructed house for about two  years. Meanwhile, he has mutated his name by  opening a separate khatian and by paying rent and  also a new municipal holding number was prepared  in his name. Thereafter when a settlement operation  was going on an attested khatian was prepared in the  name of Dr Md Jahangir Alam, a dispute case was  lodged to the concerned attestation officer by the  father-in-law of Dr Md Jahangir Alam and by father  of the defendant No. 2 to the effect that the disputed  land was gifted to the mother of Kamrun Nahar on  25-11-2001 by a gift deed No. 6457 by Kamrun  Nahar as such, the subsequent gift deed executed by  Kamrun Nahar, the defendant No. 2 on 29-11-2001  with regard to the same suit land has become infruc-  tuous. The learned Counsel next submits that mean-  while plaintiff of Title Suit No. 8 of 2004 received  summons along with a copy of the plaint of Title   Suit No. 29 of 2003 wherefrom Dr Md Jahangir   Alam came to realise about the dishonest and deecp-  tive intention of his wife, father-in-law and mother  in-law and was constrained to file the declaration  suit No. 8 of 2004 . The learned trial Court after dis-  cussing all the documentary evidence and the oral   evidences and after applying his judicial mind and   also after proper assessment of the evidence both  oral and documentary came to a correct and justified   finding that if at all the another gift deed was made  by Kamrun Nahar 3 days prior to 29-11-2001 it was  dormant or sleeping deed and which was not acted  upon and no delivery of possession was made as  such, by this sleeping deed no title was passed. The  learned Counsel further submits that Kamrun Nahar  has got no locus-standi to file the Title Suit No, 29  of 2003 as plaintiff according to her own claim she  was no longer the owner of the suit land but her  mother Zebun Nahar Chowdhurani was the proper  persons to file the suit under section 39 of the  Specific Relief Act as such, the suit of Kamrun                 Nahar as plaintiff is not maintainable. He also sub-  mits that under section 92 of the Evidence Act the  documentary evidence will prevail upon the oral  evidence and draw the attention of the Court to the  recital of the gift deed No, 6511 dated 29-11-2001  wherein it has been clearly stated that the suit land  was null and vacant land. He further submits that  the claim of the plaintiff in Title Suit No. 29 of 2003  js barred by waiver and acquiescence because she  herself deposed that she had gifted the suit land in  the name of her mother prior to the gift deed exe-  cuted in the name of her husband Dr Md Jahangir  Alam. Finally the leamed Counsel submits that the  jearned lower appellate Court without discussing the  evidence on record and without perusing the  exhibits and documents came to a wrong and falla-  cious finding being guided by emotion and senti-  ment and recollecting the poem written by Rabindra  Nath Tagore \"32 faq Gf\", The lower appellate  Court totally ignored the legal aspect of the case that  the suit of the plaintiff Most. Kamrun Nahar being  Title Suit No. 29 of 2003 is not maintainable accord-  ing to her own version and deposition. The lower  appellate Court in his judgment termed the gift deed  executed by Kamrun Nahar on 25-11-2001 as secu-  rity deed or as a shield against her husband. He also  submits that in legal proceedings there is no scope  or opportunity to do anything which is not permissi-  ble by law. The lower appellate Court while allow-  ing the appeals and reversing the judgment of the  trial Court is required to reverse the finding of the  trial Court with reference to the evidence on record  but the lower appellate Court without making’such  observation and without consideration of the docu-  mentary evidence and legal aspect of the case  passed a judgment absolutely guided by emotion  and sentiment and, as such, liable to be interfered by  this Court hence the Rule should be made absolute.    ",
      "11. Being aggrieved by and dissatistied with    the judgment and decree passed by the learned Joint  District Judge, Ist Court Feni the defendant-respon-                 y dent-petitioner of Title Suit No, 29 of 2003 and  plaintif-respondent petitioner of Title Suit No, 8 of  2004 Dr Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury preferred  two revisional applications being Civil Revision  Nos. 661 of 2006 and 662 of 2006 under section 115  of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the  present Rule.    ",
      "10. Being aggrieved by the judgment and  decree passed by the trial Court the defendants of  Title Suit No. 8 of 2004 and the plaintiff of Title Suit  No. 29 of 2003 preferred 2 appeals before the  learned District Judge, Feni which were subsequent-  ly heard by the Joint District Judge, Ist Court, Feni  on transfer. Both the appeals were heard analogous-  ly and disposed of by one judgment by the learned  Joint District Judge, Ist Court, Feni after hearing  both the appeals and their learned lawyer allowed  the appeals and set aside the judgment and decree  passed by the trial Court by his judgment and deeree  dated 25-1-2006 and 31-1-2006 respectively.    ",
      "9. During the course of trial the learned  Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni after exam-  ining the evidence on record and perusing the docu-  ments and exhibits produced by both the parties in  support of their respective suits and came to his  finding that the plaintiff of Title Suit No. 8 of 2004  successfully proved the case, on the other hand, the  plaintiff of Title Suit No. 29 of 2003 Most. Kamrun  Nahar miserably failed to prove her case, as such,  the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni  decreed the Title Suit No. 8 of 2004 in favour of the  plaintiff and dismissed the Title Suit No. 29 of 2003  by his judgment and decree dated 2-10-2004 and 27-  10-2004 respectively,    ",
      "8. The defendant husband Dr Md Jahangir  Alam Chowdhury contested the suit by filing writ-  ten statement denying all the material allegations  made in the plaint stating, inter alia, what he ly  stated in the plaint of his Title Suit No.63 of 2003  subsequently re-numbered as 8 of 2004, Both the  Title Suit No.29 of 2003 and 8 of 2004 tried by the  Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni and heard  analogously and disposed of by a single judgment  dated 20-10-2004.    ",
      "7. Again the defendant told her to transfer the  suit land in the name of the defendant for running  his practice as eye specialist and failing of which she  would be divorced. In order to maintain conjugal  life peacefully and considering the future of the chil-  dren she executed and registered the gift deed  No.6511 dated 29-11-2001 in favour of the defen-  dant. But on the date of execution and registration of  deed of gift she had no right and title to transfer the  suit land.    But without taking any permission from his first  wife plaintiff and the concerned Pourashava, defen-  dant married a girl of Dhaka named Asha and  brought in her house on 27-4-2003 and tried to stay  there but she prevented them and thereafter defen-  dant shifted his all machineries and equipment of his  eye clinic and chamber to a rented house and started  living there with his second wife Asha. For that the  plaintiff filed CR Case No.75 of 2003 under section  6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1962 in  the Court of Magistrate, Ist Class, Feni against the    defendant but the plaintiff could not prove the  charge under section 6(5) of the Muslim Family  Laws Ordinance of 1962 as such the case was dis-  missed, Subsequently she instituted the Civil Suit  being No.29 of 2003 on 5-6-2003 for cancellation of  gift deed dated 29-11-2001 under section 39 of the  Specific Relief Act to cancel the deed as the deed    was forged, collusive, fabricated, null, void and  inoperative.    ",
      "6. Finding no other alternative Dr Md  Jahangir Alam was compelled to institute the instant  Suit No.63 of 2003 re-numbered as 8 of 2004 for a  declaration to the effect that Gift Deed No.6457  dated 25-11-2001 registered with Feni Sub-Registry  Office executed by defendant No.2 in favour of  defendant No. 1 was collusive, fraudulent, inopera-  tive, void and not binding upon the plaintiff.  Thereafter both the cases were heard analogously by  the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni  and disposed of by a single judgment decreeing the  suit in favour of plaintiff of Title Suit No.8 of 2004  and dismissed the Title Suit No.29 of 2003 by his  judgment and decree dated 20-10-2004 and 27-10-  2004.    The brief fact of the Title Suit No. 29 of 2003  which was instituted by the plaintiff Kamrun Nahar  against her husband Dr Md Jahangir Alam  Chowdhury is that the plaintiff and defendant are the  husband and wife and they got married on 11-2.  1998 and they have | daughter and one son out of  their wedlock. At the time of their marriage her  father gifted many valuable goods and articles  including ornaments and furnitures to the defendant  husband and his father-in-law also gave Taka $ lac  to the defendant for taking higher education from  abroad. The defendant is a man of very bad nature  who always used to give pressure on her to take  money from her father's house and used to torture  her both physically and mentally for giving him  dowry. Considering the future of the plaintiff her  father made a deed of gift in the name of plaintiff on  25-4-2000 measuring 3'/, decimal of land situated  at Feni town. Her father built up a 3-storied building  with a foundation of 5-storied building by spending  huge amount of money and she had been living  there with her husband and children since 2001 . The                 defendant again created pressure on the plaintiff to  transfer the suit land to him in the name of defendant  in writing in licu of dowry and when she refused to  do so a notice of Talak was given upon her on 4-10-  2001 . The plaintiff transferred the suit land measur-  ing 3'/, decimal of land to her mother by a gift deed  on 25-11-2001 considering her future security and  safety in the absence of her husband, After issuance  of said Talak notice a Salish was held on 29-11-2001  where it was decided to settle up the dispute and to  withdraw Talak notice by the defendant and in pur-  suance of that decision of Salish the defendant with-  drew the notice of Talak by an affidavit and then  they started living their conjugal life as husband and  wife peacefully.    ",
      "5. After going through the plaint, the plaintiff  came to realise that his wife Kamrun Nahar along  with her father and mother only to deceive the plain-  tiff fraudulently executed the gift deed being  No.6511 dated 29-11-2001 . As a matter of fact  Kamrun Nahar made a gift deed to her mother on  25-11-2001 prior to the gift executed by Kamrun  Nahar to her husband on 29-11-2001 . It may be  mentioned here that Dr Md Jahangir Alam mutated  his name and obtained Kharija Khatian No.910  DCR thereof, he paid the rent in his own name for  the suit land and he also submitted the construction  plan of his three-storied building before the Feni  Municipal Office and also paid municipal taxes in    his own name because the holding number was pre.  pared in his name. He also obtained the trade licence  from municipal office in his own name for setting up  the Feni Eye Centre and electric connection, tele.  phone connection, every thing was made in the  name of the plaintiff.    ",
      "4. The brief fact of the plaintiff's case is that  the plaintiff is an eye consultant (eye specialist) of  Feni Sadar Hospital at present. The plaintitf after  passing MBBS he joined at Kalidah Sub-Centre as  Medical Officer and while serving there the father of  defendant No.2 requested him to marry his daughter  i.e. the defendant No.2, and on being satistied he  gave consent and ultimately the marriage was  solemnised in 1988 . During their wedlock they got                   one daughter and one son, The plaintiff appeared at  BCS examination of Health Cadre and qualified  himself and also subsequently passed FCPS in eye.  As an eye specialist he earned good reputation at  home and abroad. He went to Saudi Arabia through  Government and served there for a long time with  the satisfaction of the authority by high paid salary.  He did not acquire any foreign decree as alleged by  the defendants. The father-in-law of plaintiff Dr Md  Jahangir Alam Chowdhury advised him through dif-  ferent letters not to send money to the brothers of  Md Jahangir Alam and others because they will mis-  yse his money. Then he advised his son-in-law, if  you atall sent money for your future security he can  send it to his father-in-law and according to his  advice he started sending money to his father-in-  law. It may be mentioned here that Dr Md. Jahangir  Alam went to Saudi Arabia along with his wife and  children and stayed in Saudi Arabia more than one  year and came back again and joined at Feni Sadar  Hospital as eye consultant. While he was serving in  Feni Sadar Hospital he used to live with his wife and  children in a rented house at Mizan Road in Feni  town and he also set up an eye clinic there. He  brought many gold ornaments for his wife defendant  No.2 when they were coming back to Bangladesh.  While he was running his practice and clinic busi-  ness he asked his father-in-law to give account of  about Taka 10 (ten) lac which was sent to him from  Saudi Arabia. His father-in-law told him that he has  invested the money in his business and he would  repay the money latter on. The defendant No.2, the  wife of Dr Md Jahangir Alam, was very much  annoyed and displeased with him as he asked for his  money to his father-in-law. Thereafter the defendant  No.2 started pick to up quarrels with her husband on  different pleas and she became very much disobedi-  ent and unloyal to her husband. While residing at  Mizan Road, Feni Town she used to frequently visit  her father's house without seeking any permission  from her husband and started a reckless life.  Subsequently the relationship between the husband  and wife became very bitter and they used to pick-  up quarrels frequently, That the plaintiff also started    giving pressure upon his father-in-law to get back    his money. As a result the defendant No.2, the wife    of Dr Md Jahangir Alam, without seeking any per-    mission went to her father's house along with her    children and stayed some days there and again she    came to her husband's house. The defendant No.2    started leading her life according to her sweet will    and used to go out from her husband's house fre-  quently to visit her father's house and relations’  house. At last finding no other alternative, the plain-  tiff sent a divorce notice to the defendant No.2 on 4-  10-2001 through local Pourashava. After receipt of  that notice a Salish was held on 18-11-2001 at old  Bar Library building Feni. The Salish was presided  over by Dr Shahidullah who was the then President  of the Feni Doctors’ Association and in presence of  brother of defendant No.2 Manjur Wahab and two  advocates of Feni Bar Md Nurul Amin and Md  Saidur Rahman and close relation of defendant No.2  Md Zahirul Hoque and both the plaintiff and the  defendant Nos. 2 were present in the Salish. After  much negotiation and also after looking at the wel-  fare of the children the Salishdar came to a agree-  ment to the effect that Dr Md Jahangir Alam will  withdraw his divorce notice and the defendant No.2  Kamrun Nahar will make a gift of 3'/, decimal of  land in the name of her husband Dr Md Jahangir  Alam Chowdhury which was gifted to Kamrun  Nahar by her father defendant No.3 . Accordingly a  Salishnama (Raida) was prepared but since the  father-in-law of Dr Md Jahangir Alam denied that he  did not take or receive 10 lac Taka from Saudi  Arabia sent by Dr Md Jahangir Alam as such it was  not written in the Salishnama. The Salishnama was  signed by all the persons present in the Salish  including the plaintiff and the defendant. Thereafter  the Salishnama or Raida was authenticated by a  Notary Public and it was settled up in the Salish that  both plaintiff and defendant will abide by the deci-  sion of the Salish, Thereafter Dr Md Jahangir Alam  on the same date withdrew his divorce notice and on  29-11-2001 the defendant No.2 Kamrun Nahar exe-  cuted a gift deed No. 6511 dated 29-11-2001 at Feni  Sub-Registry Office in presence of the attesting wit-                 nesses No.1 Advocate Md Nurul Amin, Md Saidur  Rahman and Manjur Wahab and Kamrun Nahar was  identified by her full brother Manjur Wahab, In pur-  suance of Salishnama and gift deed subsequently Dr  Md Jahangir Alam constructed a three-storied build-  ing and set up an eye clinic and chamber under the  name and style of Feni Eye Centre in ground floor  and first floor and the plaintiff along with his wife  and children used to stay on the second floor and  they were peacefully and harmoniously living there.  Meanwhile after the lapse of about two years while  settlement operation was going and the name of Dr  Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury was published in the  draft khatian or Mat-parcha then a dispute case was  lodged before the attestation officer by the defen-  dant No.3 on behalf of defendant No.1 father-in-law  and mother-in-law to the plaintiff respectively to the  effect that the schedule land was gified to defendant  No.1 the mother of defendant No.2 Kamrun Nahar  by a registered gift deed No. 6457 dated 25-11-2001  i.e. prior to the gift made by Kamrun Nahar to her  husband on 29-11-2001 as such the khatian cannot  be prepared in the name of Dr Md Jahangir Alam.  Thereafter Dr Md Jahangir Alam gave a search in  the Sub-Registry Office, Feni to obtain the certified  copy of said Gift Deed No.6457 dated 25-11-2001.  Meanwhile he received summons along with a copy  of the plaint of Title Suit No.52 of 2003 subsequent-  ly re-numbered as 29 of 2003 filed by the defendant  No.2 Kamrun Nahar.    ",
      "3. The petitioner here as plaintiff filed Title  Suit No.63 of 2003 in the Court of Assistant Judge.  Feni Sadar, Feni for declaration that the gift deed  No.6457 dated 25-11-2001 registered with Feni  Sadar Sub-registry Office executed by the defendant  No.2 in favour of the defendant No.1 is illegal, col-  lusive, void, inoperative and not binding upon him.  The case was subsequently transferred to the Court  of Assistant Judge, Parshuram, Feni and re-num-  bered as Title Suit No. 8 of 2004.    ",

      "3. It is aGR Case and police investigation has  not yet been completed. The decision reported in 29  DLR (AD) 38 settled that proceeding can be quashed  at early stage if it does not disclose any criminal  offence. It is also settled by the Supreme Court in  numerous decisions that no case can be quashed on  defence material. It has been decided in numerous  cases that a proceeding can be quashed only one a  reference to first information report/complaint,  Now we have to see whether first information report  of the instant case discloses any criminal liability.  From a reading of the first information report, it  appears that the informant in writing made the state.  ment that “SI Ge ara oy fe ceNts are,  FRA TAA AAGAS CAF AVA ATS CHV From  this statement it appears that the said transaction  was made under an agreement and the narration of  fact in the first information report indicates also  breach of terms of the agreement had crept up from  business transaction.

We find substance in the rule. |    ",
      "2. This is a police case. Information lodged  by one, Md Motiur Rahman alleging that from  January, 1994 upto January, 1996, the accused peti-  tioner took in all from him Taka 20,25,000 and the  accused petitioner on different dates returned Taka  13,25,000 and for the reaming Taka 7,00,000 gave  cheque dated 31-7-1998 from his account main-  tained with IFIC Bank Motijheel Branch, Dhaka.  The said cheque was dishonoured twice and there-  after, the accused-petitioner paid in cash Taka  3,50,000 and took dilatory factics for paying  remaining Taka 3,50,000 . The informant demanded  the said money but on 22-8-2002 at 5-00 PM the    eS  accused petitioner flatly refused to pay the said  money, The accused petitioner obtained bail on 26.    9-2002 . Thereafter, moved this Court for quash-  ment of the proceeding.    ",

      "28. The respondents are directed to make pay-  ment of the State Honorarium (Rastrio Sammani    Bhata) and other incidental benefits to the respective  petitioners as per the amount received by them  shown in the Annexure-C to the writ petition with  effect from June 2003 except to petitioner No. 129  Md Kamrul Islam who filed separate writ petition  and to the petitioner No. 229 as his name shown in  the writ petition at SI No. 219 and the learned  Advocate has been allowed to have deleted SI No  229 from the writ petition.    ",
      "27. In the premises of discussions made above  and having regard to the decision of both the  Divisions (Annexure-G, G-1) we are of the opinion  that the action of the respondents stopping the State  Honorarium (Rastrio Sammani Bhata) of the peti-  tioners is declared to have made without lawful  authority and of no legal effect andwe find merit in  the Rule and thus, the Rule is made absolute.    ",
      "26. Before parting with the case, we feel tempt-  ed to make certain observations regarding the wel-  fare of the valiant Freedom Fighters. We have  noticed with great concern that the affairs of the  Freedom Fighters had been dealt with during BNP-  Jamaat regime apparently with the ulterior motive to  deprive the Freedom Fighters, the great sons of the  soil who undoubtedly sacrificed their lives for the  cause of the ‘Nation’. We feel with profound respect  to the Freedom Fighters that the sacred soil of  Bangladesh had been liberated by the Freedom  Fighters out of their blood and dedication (including  30 lacs Shaheeds) and resultantly, we achieved a  Free Nation, Constitution, Flag and Nation:  Anthem. Our Freedom Fighters who have come  back from the Death Valley with the grace of |  Almighty. Now, the duty of the Nation is to nourish  the Freedom Fighters with utmost dignity and hon-  our and to that end in view PO 94 of 1972 ie,  BANGLADESH (Freedom Fighters) Welfare  Foundation Order 1972 had promulgated for the                     Welfare of the disabled Freedom Fighters and  dependants of the shaheeds and thereafter, Rules  framed there under in 1984 to render smooth servic-  es to the disabled Freedom Fighters and the depen-  dants of the shaheeds, Government from time to  time granted State Honorarium to the petitioners, the  disabled Freedom Fighters from 1995-1999 and  paid the honorarium till June 2003 . BNP-Jamaat  alliance Government had stopped the honorarium on  the basis of the Regulation (Circular) dated 31-3-  2002 . It is evident from the above quoted Circular  that BNP-Jamaat Government introduced certain  terms in the Circular and introducing derogatory  term in the circular had constituted Medical Board  for Medical Test and thereafter, resorting to such  device had stopped the honorarium of the disabled  Freedom Fighters. We consider such device has  been made to deprive the disabled Freedom Fighters  from their honorarium and such method of depriva-  tion should be condemned and castigated and such  tools/device has been introduced as a process of  exclusion of the disabled Freedom Fighters from  their right of honorarium. We feel, it should be  stopped/shunned once for all. The Nation should  respect the valiant Freedom Fighters at large for all  time to come. The State (Bangladesh) should always  be kept in striving to create new avenues for the  Welfare of the Freedom Fighters. We should not for-  get their contribution for the establishment of the  Nation and the thousands of people are moving  around the world as a proud Bangladeshi  (Bangalee). This Court expects that the State shall  not in any way squeeze/lessen the avenues of wel-  fare of the freedom fighter in future in any excuse.    ",
      "25. It is now well settled principle of law that  once the privilege is given that cannot be taken away  without due process of law and this principle is  applicable in this case as no opportunity was afford-  ed to the petitioners before curtailing the opportuni-    ty that is the stopping of the State Honorarium to the  petitioners.    ",
      "24. It has been noticed that before stopping the  honorarium of the petitioners had not served any  notice or asked them to show cause as to why the  honorarium shall not be stopped. It appears further  the petitioners were not given any fair opportunity  of being heard and thus action stopping the honorar-  ium is ex facie violative of the principle of natural  justice. Whatever action has been taken by way of  stopping the State Honorarium is without lawful  authority and of no legal effect.    ",
      "23. The contention raised by the added respon-  dent No, 5 as to petitioner No, 159—Md Golam  Nabi is vague and based on disputed question of  facts. The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the  respondent No, 2 Bangladesh Muktijoddha  Kallayan Trust does not disclose any objection to  have taken by the respondent No, 2 as to petitioner  No. 159 Md Golam Nabi. The determination as to    the genuineness of a Freedom Fighter is the exclu.  sive domain of the government and the respondent  No, 2 Bangladesh Muktijoddha Kallayan Trust anq  as such, we cannot accept the submission of the  added respondent No. 5.    ",
      "22. Against the judgment and order of the High  Court Division passed in several writ petitions  respondent No. 2 preferred Civil Petition for leave  to appeal being No. 1157-61 of 2007 and their  Lordships of the Appellate Division held  <br>  “We called upon the learned Counsel rep-  resenting the leave petitions to address the  Court as regard the finding of the High Court  Division that the writ petitioners were paid  Honorarium/Rastrio Sammani Bhata for 32  years in the light of the list prepared and pub-  lished in the official gazette and that before tak-  ing the impugned action i.e. canceling, curtail-  ing, reducing or stopping payment of  Honorarium/ Rastrio Sammani Bhata whether  the writ petitions were heard or that they were  given opportunity to establish the fact that they  were and are the Freedom Fighters and to estab-  lish that earlier they were listed as Freedom  Fighters since they established that fact, i.e.,  Freedom Fighters, by reliable materials.    The learned Counsel for the petitioners  could not refer to any materials or in other  words from the materials as are in the paper  books of the respective petitions for leave to  appeal nor could produce any materials to  establish that before taking the action in respec-  tive of the writ petitioners, who established  their right to receive Honorarium/Rastrio  Sammani Bhata as Freedom Fighters after  being listed in the list of Freedom Fighters pub-  lished in the official gazette and enjoyed the  said right for the last 32 years without interrup-  tion or question from any corner. In the afore  state of the matter we are of the view of High  Court Division was not in error in making the  Rules absolute upon arriving at the finding that  the writ petitioners of the respective writ peti-  tions were deprived of their establish right of  receiving the honorarium/Rastrio Sammani  Bhata in an whimsical and capricious manner  and that action impugned i.e, cancellation/ cur-  tailment/reduction/stop/nonpayment of the  Honorarium was a malafide action of the Writ                 Respondents and same manifest from the nature  and kind of the action complained of and is evi-  dent from the materials on record. The materi-  als in the paper books clearly demonstrate that  the action was anything but not fair since the  writ petitioners were deprived of the benefits,  which they acquired upon establishment of the  fact of their being Freedom Fighters and they  were paid for the 32 years, of receiving  Honorarium/Rastrio Sammani Bhata in total  disregard of the universally accepted principle  of natural justice or in other words without  hearing them or affording opportunity to place  their case, and the action impugned was taken  to their prejudice keeping them in dark.    The learned Counsels for the writ petition-  er-respondents submitted that the action com-  plained of was a motivated one and that the  action impugned in the writ petitions was  parochial as well as suffered from bad faith and  as such, the High Court Division was correct in  declaring action of the writ respondents illegal  and of no legal effect.    The submission of the learned Counsels of  the writ petitioner-respondents in the back-  ground of the nature and kind of the action  complained of as well as the materials on record  appears to be of merit and thus worth consider-  ation.  <br>  In view of the discussion made herein  before we are of the opinion that the judgments  of the High Court Division sought to be appealed  call for no interference by this division.    Accordingly, petitions are dismissed.”    ",
      "21. The relevant observations made in the  judgment are reproduced below :   <br>               “It is a matter of surprise, that after long  lapse of 32 years, the degree of disabilities of  the petitioners were again determined by the  Committee and pursuant to the report dated 31-  3-2003 (Annexure-X-3), the “Rastrio Sammani  Bhata” of the petitioners were stopped.  <br>  Admittedly, before passing the impugned  orders, the petitioners were not served any  notice or show cause, against the proposed  action. They were not given any opportunity to  be heard. Natural Justice requires that before a  person is punished an opportunity to show  cause against the proposed punishment should  be afforded to him.  <br>  The essential feature of the principle of  natural justice is that no person should be  deprived of his right without hearing before an  independent authority. Its purpose is to prevent  miscarriage of justice.  <br>  The concept of natural justice cannot be  confined to any precise definition. It is not jus-  tice in the abstract or moral sense and is not  even justice accordingly to natural law. The  essential feature of the principle of natural jus-  tice is simply that no person shall be deprived  of any vested right by any order, judicial or oth-  erwise without a hearing before an independent  authority not interested in the proceedings or in  any party to the proceedings.    In the case of Saiyyid Abul A'la Maudoodi  vs Government of West Pakistan, reported in 17  DLR (SC) 209 = PLD, 1964 (SC) 673 wherein  it is held :    Principle of audi alteram partem is applica-  ble to administrative orders—The principle of  natural justice requiring a hearing to be granted  to a person before being condemned, applies  not only to judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding  but also to administrative proceeding provided  that the relevant statute does not exclude its  application and requires the administrative  authority concerned to base its decision on an  objective determination of facts.”    ",
      "20. Annexure-’G’ is the judgment and order  passed in the writ petition No. 2183 of 2004, where  one of us (Mr Justice ABM Khairul Haque) is party  to the judgment. On close reading of the judgment,  it appears that their Lordships had dealt with the  similar facts and laws on the subject and upon  scrutiny of the PO 94 of 1972 and Rules of 1984 and  other papers relating to the grant of State  Honorarium had made the Rule absolute and given  direction to the respondents to cause payment of  State Honorarium from June 2003 and also to pay  arrears to the petitioners of WP No. 2183 of 2004.    ",
      "19. Upon further scrutiny of the president order  and the Rules there under, we do not find any provi-  sion for 2nd time medical test of the Freedom  Fighters who were once found disabled.    ",
      "18. In the affidavit-in-reply, the petitioners have  urged to allow the petitioners to delete the serial No,  219 and accordingly, the petitioners are allowed to  delete the same and after delation SI No. 229 the  person shown in serial No. 219 will be entitled to get  the benefit. The name of the petitioner No. 129 is  allowed to be deleted from the serial No. 129 as  prayed for as he filed separate writ petition.    ",
      "17. Petitioner Nos. 40, 110, 119 and 134, 157,  206 and 207 are entitled to receive honorarium at the  rate of Taka 5,625 . The petitioners were receiving at  the reduce rate for their necessity before issuance of  Rule which is being reflected from the A ffidavit-in-  reply and similarly, it appears from the reply that the  petitioner No. 49 is receiving allowance after  issuance of Rule. We do not find any provision in  the PO 94 of 1972, the Regulation of 1984 to have  made debarring a pensioner to get State  Honorarium.    ",
      "16. On scrutiny of the list of the Freedom  Fighters (Annexure-’C’) it appears that the State  honorarium was sanctioned and paid to Freedom  Fighters from the date mentioned against their  respective name including 62 persons who has been  allegedly have 0% disability rather they have no dis-  ability to be entitled to receive the State Honorarium  has got no basis, In coming to such findings the  Tespondent No. 2 has not stated the age of the free-  dom fighters though they by now attained more than  60 years who incurred natural disabilities and  unable to earn their livelihood and in such circum-    stances, finding as to disability does not stand. We  find that such findings have got no rational basis for  which such contention as to disability does not ten-  able in law, which has been made with ulterior  motive behind the knowledge of the 62 persons.    ",
      "18. We have considered the Annexures,  annexed to the writ petition, Annexure-A is the pres-  ident’s order No. 94 of 1972 by which Bangladesh  (freedom fighters) Welfare Foundation was created  for welfare of the disabled freedom fighters, and  dependants of shaheeds of war of liberation, it con-  tains among others in Rule 3(2) “(F) to sanction  pension to such beneficiaries as are unable to pursue  normal vocations”. Annexure-B is the Rules made  under Bangladesh (Freedom Fighter) Welfare  Foundation which has been promulgated to manage  the affairs of the Welfare Trust having regard to the  provision of PO 94 of 1972.    Rule 6 of Bangladesh (Freedom Fighters)  Welfare Trust Rules 1984.        ",
      "14. Mr JK Paul, the leamed Advocate for the  respondent No. 2 in disagreeing with the submis-  sions of the leaned Advocate for the petitioners has  submitted that the petitioners by suppressing the  facts obtained the Rule but the respondents have not  stopped the State Honorarium of the petitioners but  only stopped the honorarium of those who were  found to be fake freedom fighters after investigation  and of the petitioners, who have no disability after  medical test according to the regulation (circular)  2002 and also of those who did not appear before the  Medical Board and that the respondent performs                  their function as per provisions laid down PO  94/1972, Regulation of 1984 and 2002 and prayed  for discharging the Rule.    ",
      "13. The learned Advocate then refers to  Annexure-\"G1” to the writ petition, the judgment of  the Appellate Division passed in Civil Petition for  Leave to Appeal No. 1157-61 of 2007 which arose  from judgments and orders dated 7-6-2007 passed  by the High Court Division in writ petition Nos.  753/05, 31860/04, 2183/04, 3362/04 and 4339/04  and submitted that the judgments and orders passed  by the High Court Division were not interfered  rather affirmed by the Appellate Division.    ",
      "12. Mr Syed Haider Ali, the learned Advocate  appearing for the petitioners has placed the writ  petition and the Annexure so annexed with the writ  tition, affidavitinopposition filed by the respon-  dent No, 2, and the supplementary affidavit,  Aflidavit-in-reply filed by the petitioners and sub-  mitted that after examining all the required docu-  ments and in compliance of all required formalities  and after being satisfied, the petitioners were sclect-  edas disabled freedom fighters having regard to the  provision of PO 94 and 159 of 1972 and the rules  and procedure there under. The petitioners were  allowed State Honorarium and they had been receiv-  ing from 1995 which has been shown in the  Annexure-‘C’ to the writ petition and subsequent  BNP—Jamaat alliance Government had stopped the  honorarium from middle of 2003 (June 2003) with-  out giving any show cause notice and without hear-  ing the petitioners and thereby, violated the principle  of natural justice and as such, the order stopping the  honorarium be declared to have stopped arbitrarily,  unconstitutionally and without lawful authority. He  submitted further that the disabilities of the petition-  ers had been determined and confirmed and being  satisfied of their disabilities and after observing due  process of law paid state honorarium and in the  process, they acquired a vested right to their state  remuneration as freedom fighters and stopping the  payment unilaterally, the respondents have acted  arbitrarily and such arbitrary action be declared to  have been made without lawful authority and is of  no legal effect. The learned Advocate further sub-  mitted that the respondents have violated the princi-  ple of natural justice in stopping the State  Honorarium without letting them know of their fault    and as such, their malafide action needs be declared  to have taken illegally, without lawful authority and  is of no legal effect. He again submitted that stop-  ping of State Honorarium to the petitioners who are  freedom fighters is illegal and to have stopped vio-  lating the rights guaranteed under Article-27 and 31  of the Constitution and such action of the respon-  dents is liable to be declared to have been made  without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. He  submitted further that it is now well settled principle  that once the privilege is given, it can not be taken  away without due of process of law and thereby, the  respondents stopping the honorarium have acted  without lawful authority and the same is of no legal  effect. The learned Advocate has drawn our atten-  tion to the Annexure-G and submitted that one of the  Divisions of this Court on a similar matter declared  the actions inasmuch as stopping the “Rastrio  Sammani Bhata” of the petitioners was illegal and  without lawful authority and the Rule was made  absolute on 7-6-2007 in WP No. 2183 of 2004.    ",
      "11. One Mr Md Golam Mostafa posing himself  as freedom fighter has submitted an application for  being added respondent No. 5 in the instant writ  petition and accordingly, he was added respondent  No. 5 by order dated 25-11-2008 . He has not filed  any affidavitin-opposition. In the application, he has  annexed Annexure-X-X(10). In the application for                 addition of party the added respondent No.5 stated  that the writ petitioner No, 159 Md. Golam Nabi is  a fake freedom fighter which has been revealed  from the file of the respondent No. 2 inasmuch as a  note has been reproduced in the application to that  eftect. It has been stated further that the name of  petitioner No. 159 should be struck down from the  Roll of freedom fighters as he is a fake Freedom  Fighter.    ",
      "9. The respondent No. 2 also filed a supple-  mentary affidavit on 8-7-2009 quoting the ‘Regu-  lation’ (circular) 2002 . This Regulation indicates  that 6 members committee headed by Brigadier  General Ali Akbar had been formed for making rec-  ommendation for the disabled Freedom Fighters for  giving honorarium and also to fix the percentage of  disabilities who will be allowed honorarium having  regard to the Regulation 2002 . Which in verbatim is  reproduced to below : <br>  10.An affidavit-in-reply has been filed by the    petitioners against the affidavit-in-opposition filed  on behalf of the respondent No. 2 . The petitioners in    the reply denied the allegations and statements made  in the affidavit-in-opposition and stated that the  alleged disability at the rate of 0% shown is vague  and unspecified in respect of 62 petitioners and stat-  ed further that the petitioners Nos. 40, 110, 119, 134,  157, 206 and 207 are entitled to receive the  allowance at the rate of Taka 5,625 but these peti-  tioners were receiving allowance at the reduced rate  for their necessity before the issuance of Rule and  that petitioner No. 49 is receiving at the rate of Taka  6750 after issuance of Rule in the writ petition and  that there is no bar in receiving the allowance by a  pensioner and denied the allegation made in para-  graph No. 19 that the petitioners are not receiving  the allowance intentionally and urged to delete the  name of the petitioner shown at serial No. 129 as he  filed another writ petition; and that the petitioner  No. 203 is entitled to receive honorarium as the Title  Suit No. 142 of 2009 is not maintainable in law and  also submitted that the petitioner will withdraw the  suit. In the affidavit-in-reply, it has also been stated  that the petitioners had appeared before the authori-  ty in 1999 for medical check up as to their disabili-  ty and they were found disabled after examination  and accordingly, granted State honorarium benefit  and since then, they had been receiving the honorar-  ium till stoppage of the same during 2003 by the  BNP—Jamaat alliance Government and the respon-  dents most illegally reopened the so-called medical  proceeding with a view to deprive the petitioners  from the benefit though legally granted honorarium  from 1995 to 1999 . It has been further submitted  that the respondents have violated the principle of  natural justice in not giving an opportunity of being  heard before stopping the allowance and had most  illegally stopped the allowances in 2003 which is  not sustainable in law.    ",
      "8. The petitioners No. 129 Md Kamrul Islam  filed another writ petition No. 5825 of 2008 along  with others. Jamshed Ali the petitioner No. 203 of  this writ petition filed Title Suit No. 142 of 2009 in  the Court of Assistant Judge, 5th Court, Dhaka  which is pending. It has been further stated that the    Petitioners obtained the Rule suppressing the facts  HC 46    but the respondents never stopped the allow  the petitioners but stopped the allowances who have  been found fake freedom fighters and also those  who were found having no disability after medical  test, according to ‘Regulation’ 2002 and also who  did not appear before the Medical Board and that the  respondents are disbursing the allowance according  to the provisions laid down in PO 94 of 1972,  ‘Regulation’ 1984 and 2004 and the petitioners have  filed this writ petition with malafide intention for  obtaining allowances violating the provisions of  law.    ances of    ",
      "7. The petitioner No, 223 was absent in med-  ical test and as such, his allowance was stopped. The  petitioners intentionally are not receiving the allot-  ted allowance at the rate of Taka 1350 though 7 peti-  tioners have been receiving Taka 1350 of the same  category.    ",
      "6. In the affidavit in opposition, it has been stat-  ed that 62 petitioners such as 8, 17, 18, 27, 28, 30,  32, 34, 39, 41, 43, 45, 46,47, 50, 51, 52, 56, 59, 63,  64, 66, 69, 72, 76, 7, 80, 101, 102, 103, 104, 106,  123, 124, 125, 126, 132, 135, 141, 144, 149, 150,  152, 154, 155, 156, 158, 173, 175, 177, 178, 184,  188, 189, 191, 196, 204, 205, 219, 220, 222 and 229  were found 0% disability after medical test and that  petitioner No. 219 is shown twice that is the same  person is also shown at serial no. 229 with 0% per-  son disability. The petitioner Nos. 40, 110, 119, 134,  157, 206 and 207 having disability 1 % to 19 % are  receiving allowance at the rate of Taka 1350 per  month. Petitioner’s No. 44 having disability at 45%  has been receiving at the rate of Taka 6750 though  earlier he had received Taka 2004 per month. The  petitioner No. 66 after retirement from government  service is drawing pension and he is known as reha-  bilitated disabled freedom fighter, according to reg-  ulation 1984.    ",
      "5. The respondent No. 2 Bangladesh  Muktijoddha Kallayan Trust, represented by the  Managing Director submitted affidavitin-opposi-  tion.    ",
      "4. The petitioners, then filed several applica-  tions and representations before the tespondent No.  2 for payment of the honorarium/ remuneration but  the respondent No. 2 did not give any reply. The  petitioners, then realized that individually they shall  not be able to compel the Tespondents to pay their  honorarium, then they formed an Association in the  name of “Bangladesh Juddahato Muktijoddha |  Rashtrio Sommani Bhata Bastobayon Parishad” and  the president of the Association made several Tepre-  sentations before the respondent No. 2 and others                 for giving their remuneration w hich they had been  enjoying but the respondents did not consider the  representations and ultimately, the petitioners filed  this writ petition and after hearing the learned  Advocate for the petitioners, the Rule was issued as  aforesaid.    ",
      "3. In exercise of power under PO No. 94 of  1972 the Board of Trustees in charge with the man.  agement of the trust, promulgated Bangladesh  (Freedom Fighters) Welfare Trust Regulation in  1984 in order to regulate the affairs of the Trust con-  cerning the rehabilitation of disabled freedom fight-  ers through proper listing and ensuring payment of  benefits and allowance to them. The injured  Freedom Fighters applied for their enlistment as dis-  abled freedom fighters at different times during  1997 and 1998 and the authority, after proper scruti-  ny found the petitioners as Genuine freedom fight-  ers and also found them as disabled due to injuries  received at the time of Liberation War of 1971 and  thereafter, the respondents being satisfied started to  give the State Honorarium benefit to the petitioners  and the petitioners had been receiving their honorar-  ium from the date of granting honorarium of the  respective date. All on a sudden, in the middle pan  of 2003, the respondents without assigning any rea-  sons or asking the petitioners to show cause or serv-  ing in a notice the payment of honorarium was  stopped and since then, they have been depriving in |  getting the honorarium.    ",
      "2. In the writ petition, it has been stated that the  respondent No, 2 Bangladesh (Freedom Fighters)  Welfare Trust constituted for the Welfare of the free.  dom fighters and particularly the disabled (inca.  pable of pursuing any normal vocation because of  injuries suffered during the war of liberation) free.  dom fighters, their dependants and dependants of  the Martyrs of the War of Liberation and to provide  assistance for their livelihood and rehabilitation,    ",
      "1.    Principle of Natural Justice—Once the pri-  vilege is given that cannot be taken away without  due process of law and this principle is applicable  in this case as no opportunity was afforded to the  petitioners before curtailing the opportunity that  is the stopping of the state honorarium to the  petitioners.    Syed Haider Ali, Advocate-For the Petitioner.  JK Paul, Advocate-For the Respondent Nos. 2-4.    Mustafa Zaman Islam, Deputy Attorney-General-  For the Respondents.  <br>  Judgment <br>   Md Mamtazuddin Ahmed J: On the application  under Article 102 of the Constitution of the People’s  Republic of Bangladesh by 244 Freedom Fighters,  the Rule was issued on the following terms:  <br>  “Let a Rule Nisi issue calling upon the  respondents to show cause as to why the action  of the respondents stopping the State Honora-  rium of the petitioners should not be declared to  have been made without lawful authority and is  of no legal effect and why the respondents  should not be directed to give the State  Remuneration to the petitioners as per the  amount received by them as shown in Annexure-  ’C’ with effect from June, 2003 and/or such other    or further order or orders passed as to this Court  may seem fit and proper.”    *Writ Petition No, 5069 of 2008,    ",
      "31. However, there shall be no order as to  costs.    Let a copy of the judgment along with LCR be  sent down to the Courts below at once.   <br> Ed.  <br>  HIGH COURT DIVISION <br> (Criminal Miscellaneous Ju diction) <br>   Siddiqur Rahman afiqul Islam......Petitioner  Miah J  Md Abdul Hatiz J \"  Judgment State and anot   <br> February 23rd, 2009 . Opposite Parties ",
      "30. In the result, the Rule is made absolute.  The judgment and decree dated 22-6-2002 passed  by the learned Joint District Judge, 2nd Court,  Faridpur in Title Appeal No. 20 of 2001, allowing  the appeal and decrecing the suit, is hereby set aside  and the judgment and decree dated 29-10-2002  passed by the learned Assistant Judge in Title Suit  No. 33 of 1998, dismissing the suit, is hereby  restored and maintained.    ",
      "29. Upon apprising through evidence on record  and the judgment of the Courts below, this Court has  got no hesitation but to hold that the appellate Court  erroncously allowed the appeal and decreed the suit  when the plaintiff miserably failed to prove the  alleged Bainapatra as genuine document through  which he has allegedly obtained the possession of  the suit property and, as such, this Court finds suffi-  cient merit in the Rule which is required to be made  absolute.    ",
      "28. The learned Advocate Mr Shisir Kanti  Majumder heavily hammered on the point that onus  of proving the non-execution of Bainapatra by the                 defendant No. 1 lies on the shoulders of defendant  No. 1 which he failed to discharge. This is a noble  argument contrary to the age-old principle that the    plaintiff has to prove his own case. In a suit for  Specific Performance of Contract the execution of  Bainapatra, if denied by the defendant the alleged  executant, the onus probandi of genuine execution  of the same lies upon the shoulder of the plaintiff on  the principle that the plaintiff has to prove his own  case. Therefore, this Court finds no merit in the  argument of Mr Shishir Kanti Majumder. The  referred case of Zahid Ali Mondol vs Jamjini Kanta  Dey reported in 1987 BLD (AD) 156 being on the  point of benefit as provided in section 141(g) of the  Evidence Act, 1872 has no manner of application in  this case.    ",
      "27. It appears that law requires caveat emptor,  meaning thereby that the purchaser must be careful  about purchased property and the procedure through  which he purchased the property. The alleged  Bainapatra has been written on a single stamp paper  worth 0.75 Taka, but at the relevant time the stamp  duty for Bainapatra was fixed at Taka 1.50 . The  plaintiff said that the stamp paper had been supplied  by the defendant No. | and he did not enquire the  legality of writing the Bainapatra on an old dated  insufficient stamp. This indicates the forgery sur-  rounding the creation of the Bainapatra, because it js  very easy to procure an old dated stamp of any  denomination on any person's name with the collab-  orative of the corrupt stamp vendors and the goy-  ernment treasury employees. The circumstances  surrounding this case clearly proved that the plain-  tiff after procuring a antedated stamp paper man-  aged to write Bainapatra on it with the help of so-  called attesting witnesses, two of whom are his own  persons, admittedly the PW 3 is his nephew and PW  2 is a friend. Therefore, this Court finds that the  appellate Court considering the evidence on record  perversely, both oral and documentary, reversed the  judgment of the trial Court dismissing the suit and,  as such, this Court finds sufficient strength in the  argument of the learned Advocate Mr Jahangir Alam  that the impugned judgment passed in appeal is not  a proper judgment of reversal. In this respect the  case of Quazi Din Mohammad vs Al-haj Arjan Ali  reported in 47 DLR (AD) 48 and the case of Biplob  Chandra Das vs Biren Chandra Das reported in 52  DLR 586 are relevant, wherein their Lordships in the  Appellate Division and also in this Division held  that inadequacy of consideration sometimes should  be considered against the genuineness of the  Bainapatra and also in the case where Bainapatra is |  denied with the circumstances surrounding the exe-  cution of it, must be taken into consideration before  coming to decisive decision that the same is a gen-  uine one.    ",
      "26. It further appears that the plaintiff alleged  that he had purchased the suit property measuring  1.02 acres of land at a consideration of Taka 25,000  which the trial Court found that as the plaintiff  admitted that his own property, adjacent to the suit  property, is valued at Taka 1,00,000 and, as such, the  consideration, as alleged by the plaintiff, indicates  that the same is not a genuine one. This Court is in  agreement with the finding of the trial Court and  disagrees with the finding of the appellate Court that  the plaintiff casually said that his property, adjacent  to the suit property, is valued at Taka 1,00,000 . This  vital point regarding the consideration of the suit  property, in a suit for Specific Performance of  Contract, is one of the clements upon which the  genuneness of Bainapatra may be considered, spe-  cially when the defendant has categorically denied  that he has not executed the impugned Bainapatra in  favour of the plaintiff. Moreover, the appellate  Court upon appraising the evidence of DWs appar-  ently perversely came to the finding regarding the  hand over of possession of the suit property to the  plaintiff, although PW 2 and PW 3 failed to prove  that any such possession was handed over in their  presence, save and except the statement that the  defendant No. 4 forcibly dispossessed the plaintiff  from the possession of the suit property. Therefore,  on the admission of the plaintiff that the defendant  No. 3 and defendant No. 4 are in possession of the  suit property, albeit in part as alleged, the question  of handing over of possession of the suit property to  the plaintiff earlier at the time of execution of the  Bainapatra must have been considered by the appel-  late Court as not proved. Therefore, this Court finds  that the assertion regarding handing over of posses-    sion of the Baina land to the plaintiff is nothing but  a falsity.    ",
      "25. Upon scanning through the evidence on  record, it appears that the learned appellate Judge  fell into an error when apprising the evidence on  record as to the genuneness of the Bainapatra which  appears to this Court as based upon surmises and  conjecture. It appears that while considering the  date of the stamp paper, upon which the Bainapatra  Was written in a compact manner, the appellate  Court opined that it is unbelievable that the plaintif?  would keep a stamp paper worth Taka 0.75 in order  to write a Bainapatra after 16 years. This opinion of  the appellate Court is apparently perverse consider-  ation of the evidence, inasmuch as, the appellate                   Court did not consider that the alleged executants of  the Bainapatra, the defendant No. 1 Naimuddin  Mollah, was an admittedly landless person, having  no reasonable business to keep a stamp paper with  him for 16 years. The opinion of the appellate Court  is nothing but a surmise which is neither supported  by any evidence on record nor by the circumstances  surrounding the case.    ",
      "24. But the question remains whether the  appellate Court apprised the evidence on record to  come to a finding that the plaintiff could prove the  genuineness of the Bainapatra through the evidence  on record as adduced by the PWs and also through  the cross-examination of the DWs. It appears that  the PW 1 asserted that while the defendant No.!  Naimuddin Molla was a landless person in the year  1979, obtained the settlement of khas property from                     the government, defendant No.2, measuring an area  of 1.32 acres comprised in three plots which he in  the year of 1994, afier expiry of 15 years, when  offered to sell, the plaintiff accepted the offer to pur-  chase the same at a consideration of Taka 25,000.  The defendant No.1 in order to substantiate their  assertion that the impugned Bainapatra is a forged  one heavily hammered the point of consideration. It    appears that the trial Court found that the plaintiff    admitted that he has a piece of land adjacent to the  suit property of the same quantum which he admit-  ted ted at Taka 1,00,000, The trial Court upon  such fact disbelieved the consideration of Taka  25,000 for the same quantum of land adjacent to the  jand of the plaintif's ownership. But the appellate  Court on this point came to the finding that upon  such single assertion of the PW 1 the genuineness  of the Bainapatra cannot be ascertained. The plain-  tiff in his deposition asserted that in the presence of  PW 2 and PW 3 he negotiated the sale of the suit  property and after stipulating the price when he  demanded a Bainapatra, then and there, defendant  No. | disclosed that he has got a stamp paper, earli-  er purchased on 21-12-1978, upon which Bainapatra  may be written. The plaintiff allowed to write the  Bainapatra on the same stamp paper when defendant  No. 1 executed the same by putting his LTI and at  the same time PW 2 and PW 3 also put their signa-  tures in the Bainapatra as the attesting witnesses.  The trial Court on such fact of execution of the  Bainapatra in an insufficient and old dated stamp  found a reason to disbelieve the Bainapatra on the  ground, then the PW 1 admitted that he has not  questioned the legality and illegality of writing the  Bainapatra on an old dated stamp, nor he consulted  any lawyer on such point. The learned Advocate Mr  Shisir Kanti Majumder on this point submits that as  there was urgency from the part of the defendant  No, 1 to get the money immediately, upon selling  the land, he hurriedly supplied the stamp paper kept  in his custody and the plaintiff on bonafide belief  did not suspect any impediment for writing the  Bainapatra on the said old dated stamp paper. The  appellate Court on this point found that there is no  reason to disbelieve the assertion of the plaintiff,  since it is beyond all probable suggestion that the  plaintiff shall keep a stamp paper for last 16 years in  the name of the defendant No. 1 for writing a  Bainapatra on the same stamp paper after 16 years  and accordingly, the learned appellate Judge  believed that the stamp paper was genuine one upon  which the plaintiff, through scribe, wrote the  Bainapatra, It further appears that the plaintiff  asserted that on the date of execution of the  Bainapatra, he was given the possession of the suit  property in which he was in possession till he was  dispossessed by the defendant Nos. 3-5 on and from  9-8-1999 during the pendency of the suit. The trial  Court disbelieved such assertion of the plaintiff on  the ground that the PWs, on this assertion of the  plaintiff, could not prove the possession of the plain-  tiff in the suit property and, as such, the trial Court  did not believe the hand over of possession of the  suit property by the defendant No. | to the plaintiff.  On the other hand, the appellate Court came to the  finding that the plaintiff was in possession of the suit  property from which the defendant Nos. 3-5 dispos-  sessed him and accordingly, the appellate Court  found the possession of the plaintiff as genuinely  obtained through the impugned Bainapatra. In this  respect the appellate Court appraised the evidence  of DW 2 and came to the finding that the assertion  of the defendant Nos. 3-5 is false and the plaintiff's  Bainapatra having been sufficiently proved by the  evidence on record the appeal is entitled to be  allowed and the suit decreed.    ",
      "23. In the case before us, it appears that at the  relevant period the stamp duty for a Bainapatra  (deed of agreement for sale of land) was fixed at  Taka 1.50 but the impugned Bainapatra, dated 17-S-  1994, was written on a stamp paper of denomination  of Taka 0.75 . Finding such insufficiency of the   stamp duty of the Bainapatra the appellate Court  came to the finding that as the Bainapatra has been  proved by the plaintiff, the same is required to be  impounded under the provision of Order XII, rule §  of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and accord-  ingly, the appellate Court in the impugned judgment  passed an order for impounding the said Bainapatra  and allowed the appeal subject to payment of  impounded stamp duty by the plaintiff, which the  plaintiff has already paid. It appears that this lacuna  in the impugned Bainapatra for insufficiency of  stamp duty has been cured by the said impounding  order and in view of the provision of section 35 of  the Stamp Act, 1899 this Court finds that the  impugned Bainapatra was competent to be admitted  into evidence in this proceeding. Moreover, in view  of the provision of section 36 of the Stamp Act,  1899 and the decision of the case reported in 39  DLR 243, this Court finds that the appellate Court  correctly considered that the said Bainapatra as  admissible in evidence. Therefore, this Court finds  substantial force in the argument of Mr Shisir Kanti  Majumder that the impugned Bainapatra has been  correctly admitted into evidence by the trial Court as  well as appellate Court and the question of insuffi-  ciency of the stamp duty has been properly  addressed.    ",
      "22. In the case of Daulat Lid vs Pubali Bank  Ltd reported in 39 DLR (AD) 243 as relied upon by  Mr Majumder, a Division Bench of this Court while  considering the admissibility of insufficiently  stamped document into evidence, considered the  provision of section 36 of the Stamp Act, 1899 and  held as under;    \"The provision of section 36 of the Stamp  Act is mandatory and that once a document is  admitted in evidence it is not permissible for the  trial Court or the appellate Court or the Court of    Revision to reject it as evidence on the ground  that it has not been duly stamped,”    ",
      "21. The aforesaid provision indicates that  insufficiently stamped document can be admitted  into evidence if the same is impugned and the prop-  er stamp duty is paid in Court. This also indicates  that failure to pay the proper stamp duty only  attracts penalty which, being a curable lacuna, if  Properly cured by paying the impounded stamp  duty, the same becomes competent to be admitted  into evidence, section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899  does not say to throw out a document in limine for  want of stamp duty. It further appears from section  36 of the Stamp Act, 1899 that if any document,  insufficiently stamped, is admitted into evidence,  tightly or wrongly, the same would be immune from  challenge later. Section 36 of the Stamp Act, 1899  provides as follows;    Stamp Act; 1899 :   <br> \"Section: 36—Admission of instrument  where not to be questioned—When an instru-  ment has been admitted in evidence, such  admission shall not, except as provided in sec-  tion 61, be called in question at any stage of the  same suit or proceeding on the ground that the  instrument has not been duly stamped.\"    ",
      "20. At this revisional stage the defendant-  respondent-petitioner has assailed the impugned  Bainapatra and the impounding of the stamp duty of  it by the appellate Court and, in accordance with the    ‘argument of the defendant-respondent-petitioner,    the impounding of the stamp duty of the impugned  Bainapatra did not make it a proper document to be  admitted into evidence, although the plaintiff has  already, in accordance with the order of the appel-  late Court, paid the impounded stamp duty of the  Bainapatra. Contrary to such argument the plaintiff  appellant-opposite-party contends that a series of  decisions of this Court and the law itself provides  that once a document is admitted into evidence,  rightly or wrongly, the same cannot be discarded  ater, on the ground that the same has not been prop-  erly stamped.    Section 35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 categori-  cally provides the circumstances under which a doc-  ument cannot be admitted in evidence, which runs  as follows :   <br> Stamp Act, 1899 :   <br> \"Section 35—/nstruments not duly  stamped inadmissible in evidence, ete—No    instrument chargeable with duty shall be admit-  ted in evidence for any purpose by any person  having by law or consent of parties authority to  receive evidence, or shall be acted upon, regis-  tered or authenticated by any such person or by  any public officer, unless such instrument is  duly stamped:  <br>  Provided that—   <br> (a) any such instrument not being an instru-  ment chargeable with a duly of ten poisha  or five poisha only, or a bill of exchange or  promissory note, shall subject to all just  exceptions, be admitted in evidence on  payment of the duty with which the same  is chargeable, or, in the case of an instru-  ment insufficiently stamped, or the  amount required to make up such duty,  together with a penalty of five Taka, or,  when ten times the amount of the proper  duty or deficient portion thereof exceeds  five Taka, or a sum equal to ten times such  duty or portion :  <br>  (b) where any person from whom a stamped  receipt could have been demanded, has  given an unstamped receipt and such  receipt, if stamped, would be admissible in  evidence against him, then such receipt  shall be admitted in evidence against him  on payment of a penalty of one Taka by the    person tendering it; <br>   (c) where a contract or agreement of any kind  is effected by correspondence consisting  of two or more letters and any one of the  letters bears the proper stamp, the contract  or agreement shall be deemed to be duly    stamped. <br>   (d) Nothing herein contained shall prevent the  admission of any instrument in evidence in  any proceeding in a Criminal Court, other  than a proceeding under Chapter XII or  Chapter XXXVI of the Code of Criminal  Procedure, 1898.  <br>               (e) Nothing herein contained shall prevent the  admission of any instrument in any Court  when such instrument has been executed  by or on behalf of the Government, or  where it bears the certificate of the  Collector as provided by section 32 or any  other provision of this Act,”    ",
      "19. I have heard the learned Advocates, per-  used the impugned judgments, the materials on  record, specially the Bainapatra and the evidence as  adduced by the parties. I have also considered the  arguments advanced at the Bar.    ",
      "18. In reply the learned Advocate Mr Shisir  Kanti Majumder strenuously argued that the appel-  late Court correctly considered that the Exhibit  No.1, the impugned Bainapatra, has been admitted  correctly in evidence by the trial Court as a proved  document and accordingly, finding the same is in  insufficient stamp paper, impounded the same under  the provision of Order XIII, rule 8 of the Code of  Civil Procedure, 1908 and, as such, the appellate                 Court correctly came to the finding that the judg-  ment passed by the trial Court is liable to be set  aside and the suit is required to be decreed. In this  respeet, the learned Advocate Mr Shisir Kanti  Majumder relied on the decision of the case of  Daulat Lid vs Pubali Bank Ltd reported in 39 DLR  (AD) 243 in order to substantiate his argument that  the appellate Court correctly found that the Baina-  patra having been sufficiently proved by the plain-  tiff, the appeal is required to be allowed on collect-  ing the impounded stamp duty from the plaintiff and  as the plaintifT has already paid the impounded stamp  duty the judgment passed by the appellate Court is  not liable to be interfered with by this Court,    ",
      "17. The learned Advocate Mr Jahangir Alam  finally argued that the appellate Court committed  error while impounding the alleged Bainapatra with-  out considering the fact that the same cannot be  admitted in evidence and marked as Exhibit so as to  consider the same as evidence, since the same was  insufficiently stamped, as such, the same was not  required to be considered by the appellate Court as  a valid piece of evidence and therefore, the  impounding of the said stamp paper did not make it  a valid piece of evidence for which the judgment  passed in appeal decreeing the suit relying on inad-  missible evidence is a palpable illegality and erro-  neous on the facts and circumstances of the case  which is liable to be set aside by this Court.    ",
      "16. In reply to the 2nd count of argument of the  defendant-respondent-petitioner, Mr Sisir Kanti    Majumder argued, on behalf of the plaintiff-appel-  lant-opposite party, that since the plaintiff by the  PWs successfully proved the execution of the  Bainapatra by the defendant No.1 onus probandi  was shifted to the defendant No.1 to prove that he  has not executed the Bainapatra by putting his LT]  on the same and as such a bounden duty was cast  upon him to pray for examination of his LTI by  handwriting expert which as he failed, the plaintiff  obtained the order of the trial Court for such exami-  nation by the handwriting expert but the defendant  No.1 having apprehended that such an examination  will prove the execution of the Bainapatra as gen-  uine refrained from putting his specimen LTI,  despite the repeated orders of the trial Court and, as  such, the presumption under section 114(g) of the  Evidence Act, 1872 is applicable in this case which  shall come in benefit to the plaintiff. In this respect  the learned Advocate relied on the case of Zahid Ali  vs Jamini Kanta reported in 1987 BLD (AD) 156.    ",
      "15. The learned Advocate Mr Jahangir Alam,  on his next count of argument, assailed the judgment  passed in appeal on the ground that as the defendant  No.1 categorically, in his written statement, denied  the fact that he has not executed the alleged  Bainapatra by putting LTI, the onus probandi lies on  the plaintiff's shoulder to prove his case, that the  defendant No.1 executed the same, through making  a prayer before the Court for an examination of the  alleged LTI of the defendant No.1 by a handwriting  expert, which although the plaintiff prayed before  the trial Court, but did not take step to obtain the  specimen of LTI of the sick defendant No.1 through  Advocate Commissioner and, as such, his applica-  tion having been rejected by the trial Court, must be  treated that the plaintiff failed in discharge his onus  of proving his case. In this respect, the learned  Advocate Mr Jahangir Alam referred to the case of  Naimuddin Sarder @ Naimuddin Sarder vs Md  Abdul Kalam Biswas @ Md Abul Kalam Bashir-  uddin @ Abul Kalam Azad reported in 39 DLR (AD)  237 and also the case of Quazi Din Mohammad vs  Al-haj Arzan Ali reported in 47 DLR 48 and also the  case of Biplob Chandra Das vs Biran Chandra Das  reported in 52 DLR 586.    ",
      "14. On the other hand, the learned Advocate  Mr Shisir Kanti Majumder, while supporting the  impugned judgment, has taken this Court through  the entire reasons made by the appellate Court in  order to impress this Court that the appellate Court  correctly appraised the evidence on record and  strenuously argued that the impugned judgment is a  proper judgment of reversal as contemplated under  Order XLI rule 31 of the Code of Civil Procedure,  1908 . In accordance with the learned Advocate Mr  Majumder, the appellate Court correctly reversed  every finding of the trial Court on the basis of the  evidence on record and also on the basis of the  exhibited documents which the appellate Court  found that the trial Court passed the judgment in  slipshod manner and, as such, the appellate Court  correctly set aside the judgment of the trial Court.    ",
      "13. The learned Advocate Mr Jahangir Alam  has assailed the impugned judgment and decree  passed by the appellate Court on various counts,  specially on the ground that the appellate Court  committed error in the decision which occasioned  failure of justice, inasmuch as the appellate Court  did not categorically reverse the finding of the trial  Court who held that the Bainapatra is a forged one  which was written on 0.75 Taka stamp paper, pur-  chased in the name of the defendant No. | long 16  years ago which apparently proved that the same is  a forged document created by the plaintiff in order  to grab the defendant's property through the process  of Court. He further argued that the trial Court cor-  rectly came to the finding that although the PW 2  and PW 3 have asserted that the alleged Bainapatra  was executed in front of them but the circumstances  surrounding the alleged execution, the insufficient  stamp paper and the receiving of alleged earnest  money of Taka 20,000 from total consideration Taka  25,000 and making a condition of finalisation of the  sale after three years and also so-called handing  over of possession of the suit property to the plain-  tiff before the finalisation of the sale by executing .  and registering a saf-kabala clearly prove that the  said Bainapatra is a forged one and was not execut-  ed by the defendant No.1 . He contends that the dis-  crepancy of the evidence of PWs have not been con-  sidered by the appellate Court in its true perspective,  which if apprised by this Court shall unveil the fal-  sity embedded in it and in that case this Court will  find that the judgment passed in appeal is liable to  be interfered with by this Court.                 ",
      "12. Pursuant to the service of the Rule the  learned Advocate Mr Shisir Kanti Majumder  appeared on behalf of the plaintiff-appellant-oppo-  site party while the learned Advocate Mr Jahangir  Alam remains present on behalf of the learned  Advocate Mr Enayetur Rahim, appearing on behalf  of the defendant-respondent-petitioners and both the  Icarned Advocates argued on their respective cases,    ",
      "11. During the pendency of the Rule the defen-  dant No. 1, Naimuddin Molla, having died his other     sons and daughters were substituted on 31-1-2008 in  his place in the Rule.    ",
      "10. Being aggrieved with and highly dissatis-  fied by the judgment and decree passed by the  appellate Court the defendant-respondent preferred  the instant revisional application and obtained the  Rule,    ",
      "9. As against the said dismissal of the suit the  plaintiff preferred Title Appeal No. 20 of 2001  before the District Judge, Faridpur which was ulti-  mately heard by the leaned Joint District Judge, 2nd  Court, Faridpur who allowed the appeal upon find-  ing that the trial Court failed to consider the evi-  dence on record in its true perspective and erro-  neously dismissed the suit. The appellate Court  upon further finding that the Bainapatra being a gen-  uine one was written on insufficient stamp,  impounded the same and allowed the appeal,  decreeing the suit, on condition that the plaintiff pay  the impounded fee.    ",
      "8. The learned trial Judge upon framing pro-  per issues considered the evidence on record and  upon finding that the plaintiff miserably failed to  prove his case and upon finding that the alleged  Bainapatra is a forged one, dismissed the suit by his  judgment dated 29-10-2000,    ",
      "7. The defendant No. 1 examined one Bha-  bendra Nath Das as DW 1 and the defendant No. 4    Rowshan Ara examined herself as DW 2.  Sarwar Hoss    xamined as DW 3 Md Durjan  Bepari was examined as DW 4, and the DW 5 was  Gopal Chandra Karmaker. All of them were duly  amined by the plaintiff. The defendant  exhibited the deed of gift being No. 1368 dated 4-2-  1995, deed of gift being No. 3144 dated 21-12-1997,  deed of gift being No, 369 dated 4-2-1995 and the  suf-kabala being No, 382 dated 4-2-1995 . The rent  receipt and a copy of the plaint in Title Suit No. 34  of 1998 was duly marked as Exhibit in the suit.    ",
      "6. At the trial, the plaintitY examined himself  as PW I who was duly cross-examined by defendant  No, | and also by defendant No. 2, One Yunus Ali  Barkandas was examined as PW 2 . Plainti also  examined one Bablu Molla as PW 3 . Th be ol  the alleged Bainapatra Monnaf Mia was examined                   as PW 4, The alleged Bainapatra was exhibited    Exhibit No. 1 and the signature of the attesting wit-  nesses also marked Exhibit.    ",
      "5. The defendant No. 2 the government of  Bangladesh also contested the suit by filing written  statement admitting the settlement obtained by the  defendant No. 1 in 1.32 acres of land as mentioned  in the plaint and stating, inter alia, that the defen-  dant No. 1 upon violating the terms and conditions  of the deed of settlement, that he shall not sell the  settled property within 15 years from the date of  settlement, sold the same to the plaintiff through the  alleged Bainapatra as mentioned in the plaint. It has  been further asserted in the written statement by the  government that due to such illegal act of the defen-  dant No. 1, the government has already resumed the  settled property and none of the parties are in pos-  session of the suit property.    ",
      "4. After the filing of the written statement the  plaintiff amended his plaint and added defendant  Nos. 3-5 in the suit who are the aforesaid son's wife  and grandson of the defendant No. 1 . Later the  defendant Nos. 1, 4 and 5, by filing an additional  written statement, asserted that the defendant No. 3  Badsha Molla was missing for last two years and  there was a criminal case in between the Parties  pending and the defendant Nos. 4 and 5 upon con-  structing shop and dwelling house in the said Pprop-  erty let the same to the tenant and the plaintiff has  created a forged registered suf-kabala being No. 382  dated 4-2-1995 showing the sale of the suit proper-  ty in the name of his son Abdul Hakim Molla.    ",
      "3. The defendant No. 1 Naimuddin Mollah  contested the suit by filing written statement, deny-  ing all material allegations raised in the plaint and  admitting his right, title and possession in the suit  property but denied the execution of any Bainapatra  on 17-5-1994 in favour of the plaintiff upon accept-  ing Taka 20,000 as earnest money or any receipt of  Taka 5,000 later, towards the finalisation of the sale  of the suit property. He further asserted, in the writ-  ten statement, that neither he handed over the pos-  session of the suit property to the plaintiff nor plain-  uff got any interest pursuant to the said so-called  Bainapatra allegedly executed by defendant No. 1.  Further the defendant No. 1 asserted that he already  transferred 0.13 acres of land by registered deed of  gifi, dated 4-2-1995, in favour of his son Badsha  Molla out of suit plot No. 1193 who erected his res-  idential house and living therein. Later the defen-  dant No. | again on 4-2-1995 gifted away another  0.13 acres of land out of the suit property to his  aforesaid son Badsha Molla and further gifted away  0.06'/, acres of land to his grandson Miraj Molla on  1-2-1995 through registered deed of gift and handed  Over possession to them which was registered on 21-  12-1997, Later, the defendant No. | also sold 0.6',  acres of land to his son's wife Rowshan Ara Begum      on 4-2-1995 through registered deed. As such, his  son, son's wife and grandson are now owner in Pos-  session in 0.26 acres of land in the suit plots. The  defendant No. 1 categorically asserted that the  Bainapatra alleged to have been written on stamp  paper dated 21-12-1978 with denomination 0.75  Taka is a forged one and he did not execute the same  by putting his LTI on the same.    ",
      "2. The plaintiff Ibrahim Molla instituted Title  Suit No. 38 of 1998 in the Court of Assistant Judge,  Sadarpur, Faridpur on 28-4-1998, against the de  dant No. 1 Naimuddin Molla @ Naba Molla and the  Government of Bangladesh as defendant No. 2 pray-  ing for specific performance of contract, stating,  inter alia, that the defendant No. 1 Naimuddin  Molla had obtained settlement of a landed property  as a landless person on 17-1-1979 from the govern-  ment of Bangladesh, defendant No. 2, which was a  khas property recorded in khas khatian No. 1, mea  uring 1.32 acres of land comprised in Plot No. 1334  and 1193 within mouza Krishnapur, under Sadarpur  Upazila, Faridpur. The defendant No. | thereatter  mutated his name in the relevant record of right and  paid the rent and taxes to the government in his own  name and while possessing the same, he proposed to  sell a portion of the said property, hereinafter be  called the suit property, measuring an area of 1.02                   acres to the plaintiff at a consideration of Taka  25,000 . Thereafter a Bainapatra was executed in  between the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff on 17-  53-1994 upon payment of camest money of Taka  20,000 to the defendant No. 1 by the plaintiff and  delivery of possession of the suit property to the  plaintifY was made by the defendant No. 1 . It was  stipulated in the Bainapatra that after a period of 3  years the plaintiff will pay the balance consideration  money of Taka 5,000 and the defendant No. 1 will  execute and register the suf-kabala finalising the  sale. Later defendant No. 1, although received the  said balance consideration money of Taka 5,000  from the plaintiff, but refused to execute and regis-  ter the suf-kabala in favour of the plaintiff. In the  meantime the defendant No. 1 and his sons dispos-  sessed him from a portion of a suit property, hence  the suit.    ",
      "1.  Bainapatra has been proved by the plaintiff,    the same is required to be impounded under the  provision of Order XIII, rule 8 of the Code and  accordingly, the appellate Court in the impugned  judgment passed an order for impounding the  Bainapatra and allowed the appeal subject to  payment of impounded stamp duty which the  plaintiff has already paid. It appears this lacuna  in the impugned Bainapatra for insufficiency of  stamp duty has been cured by the said impound-  ing order and in view of the provision of section  35 of the Stamp Act, 1899 this Court finds that  the impugned Bainapatra was competent to be  admitted into evidence in this proceeding.  Moreover, in view of the provision of section 36 of  the Stamp Act, 1899 and the decision of the case  reported in 39 DLR 243, this Court finds that the  appellate Court correctly considered that the  said Bainapatra as admissible in evidence.  Therefore, the argument that the Bainapatra has  been correctly admitted into evidence by the trial  Court as well as appellate Court and the question  of insufficiency of the stamp duty has been prop-  erlyaddressed. aaa (23)    Naimuddin Sarder vs Md Abdul Kalam Biswas 39  DLR (AD) 237; Quazi Din Mohammad vs Arzan Ali 47  DLR 48; Biplob Chandra Das vs Biran Chandra Das 52  DLR 586; Zahid Ali Mondal ys Jamini Kanta Dey  *Civil Revision No. 4407 of 2002.  He 47    reported in 1987 BLD (AD) 156 and Daulat Lid vs P  Bank Ltd 39 DLR (AD) 243 ref,    ubali    Md Jahangir Alam, Advocate—For the Petitioners  <br>  Shisir Kanti Majumder, Advocate—For the Opposite  Parties.  <br>  Judgment <br>   AFM Abdur Rahman J: On an application,  under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure,  1908 this Rule was issued on 25-8-2002 at the  instance of the defendant-respondent-petitioner  Naimuddin Molla @ Naba Molla and two others  calling upon the plaintiff-appellant-opposite-party  Ibrahim Molla to show cause as to why the judg-  ment and decree dated 22-6-2002 (decree signed on  17-7-2002) passed by the learned Joint District  Judge, 2nd Court, Faridpur in Title Appeal No. 20 of  2001 allowing the appeal decreeing the suit after  setting aside the judgment and decree dated 29-10-  2000 (decree signed on 5-11-2000) passed by the  learned Assistant Judge, Sadarpur, Faridpur in Title  Suit No. 32 of 1998 dismissing the suit shall not be  set asides and or pass any other or further order or  orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.    ",
      "28. In the result, the Rule is made absolute and  the proceeding of Sessions Case No.1131 of 2007  arising out of Criminal Case No. 138 of 2007 under  section 128 of the Negotiable Instruments Act pend-  ing in the Court of learned Additional Metropolitan  Session Judge, Chittagong is hereby quashed.    Communicate the order to the Court of the  learned Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge,  Chittagong, forthwith.    Ed,    HIGH COURT DIVISION  (Criminal Revisional Jurisdiction)  <br>  Md Abdul Hye J. | Amanullah (Md).........00.., <br> Md Abdus Samad J} ...........04 Accused-petitioner  vs  State and another..........0..., <br> Opposite Party* <br>   Judgment <br> June 3rd, 2010.  ",
      "27. For the foregoing reasons, we have no  other alternative but to quash the proceedings. The  accused petitioner is, therefore, entitled to get the  relief as prayed for and, as such, the Rule should be  made absolute.    ",
      "26. Keeping these settled principles in view, it  can be said that the learned Additional Metropolitan  Sessions Judge most illegally and contrary to pre-  vailing law and established principles laid down in  the said decision of our Appellate Division had  wrongly continued with the proceeding.    ",
      "25. In view of the discussion as made above  and in the light of the facts and circumstances of the  case and law bearing to it, we are of the view that the  complainant committed wrong in two Courts firstly  he filed complaint after the expiry of statutory peri-  od of limitation and secondly, he filed a premature  complaint in contravention of section 138 Sub-sec-  tion (1) proviso (c) of the Negotiable Instrument Act  and accordingly the Court also took cognizance in  contravention of clause 141(b) of the Negotiable  Instruments Act.    ",
      "24. In the light of the above decision and con-  sidering the facts and circumstances of the case, we  are of the view that since the complainant opposite                 party No.2 filed the complaint after expiry of the  statutory period of 30 days from the date of issuance  of notice under proviso of section 138(1)(b) of the  Negotiable Instruments Act and as such taking cog-  nizance of complaint by the Magistrate was not  legal and since taking cognizance is illegal, so the  continuation of the proceeding will create a abuse of  the process of the Court.    ",
      "23. In this connection we may also profitably  refer the decision in the case of Ali Akkas vs Enayet  Hossain reported in 1997 BLD (AD) 44 = 2 BLC  (AD) 16 wherein their Lordships held:  <br>  \"the settled principle of law is that to ring a  case within the purview of section 561A for the  purpose of quashing a proceeding one of fol-  lowing conditions must be fulfilled:  <br>  (1)    Interference even at an initial stage may  be justified where the facts are so pre-  posterous that even on admitted facts no  case stands against the accused;    Where the institution and continuation of  the proceeding amounts to an abuse of  the process of the Court;  <br>  (2)    Where there is a legal bar against the ini-  tiation or continuation of the proceeding;  <br>  (3)    Ina case where the allegations in the FIR  or the petition of complaint, even if  taken at their face value and accepted in  their entirely, do not institute the offence  alleged; and  <br>  (4)    The allegations against the accused  although constituted an offence alleged  but there is either no legal evidence  adduced in support of the case or the evi-  dence adduced clearly or manifestly fails  to prove the charge.\"  <br>  (5)    ",
      "22. Now the question arises whether the  instant proceeding is liable to be quashed or not.    ",
      "21. In this connection we like to refer the deci-    Sion in the case of SM Anwar Hossain vs Md Shafiul    | dlam reported in 5] DLR (AD) 218 where in there  Lordships held :  <br>  \"Subsequent allegation will not save limi-  tation for prosecution-the requirement under  the law is that the complaint against non-pay-  ment of money has to be filed within one month  of the date on which the cause of action arises,  The High Court Division wrongly rejected the  application for quashing. The principle of the  above decision is quite applicable in our case. \"    ",
      "20. As per provision of section 138(1)(b) of the  Act, the opposite party No.2 had to file the case  within 30 days from the receipt of first notice  ecause once the opposite party No.2 gives a notice  under section 138(1)(b) of the Act, he foresight such  right and he cannot issue second notice. It is signif-  icant to note that clause (b) of section 141 gives ita  restrictive meaning is that, it refers to only one fact  which will give rise to the cause of action. Section  138 and 141 clearly postulates only one cause of  action and there is no legal scope for successive  cause of action. The combined reading of section  138 and 141 of the Act leave no room for doubt that  cause of action with the meaning of section 141(c)  arises and can arises only once. In the instant case,  such cause of action with arises within 30 days of  the receipt of first notice in accordance with  138(1)(b) of the Act. But the opposite party No.2,  Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd, filed the complaint on  24-7-2007 after expiry of 4 months 20 days from the  issuance of said notice and therefore initiation of the  impugned proceedings on the basis of second notice  is not legal and accordingly taking cognizance of the  Complaint by the Magistrate on 24-7-2007 is also  not legal. The continuation of the proceedings is  therefore, a abuse of he process of the Court.    ",
      "19. On perusal of the record, it appears that the  first notice for demand of money was issued on |-3-  2007 . There is nothing in the complaint when the                 said notice was actually served on the petitioner.  The case of the opposite party No.2 is that after get-  ting the notice, the accused petitioner came to bank  authority and verbally prayed for sometime and  accordingly sometime was given. But the accused  petitioner denied these facts. Actually there is no  record or evidence to believe such oral version of  the opposite party No.2 . The opposite party No.2  has created such story in order to save the limitation  in filing the complaint in due time. Since the oppo-  site party No.2 admits that the accused petitioner  came to the bank after getting the first notice which  clearly speaks that the first notice was duly served  on the accused petitioner.    ",
      "18. Now the question is whether the filing of  the complaint on 24-7-2007 and taking cognizance  of the complaint on 24-7-2007 is legal or not.    ",
      "17. It is undenying of the fact that the notice of  demand was issued on 1-3-2007 . As per section  138(1)(c) of the act, the accused petitioner will get  30 days, time from the date of receipt of the notice  to make payment of the said amount and thereafter  the cause of action of the case will arise. Once he  gives a notice under section 138(1)(b) of the Act, he  forfeits right to issue second notice. Herein this  case, the complainant opposite party No.2, Islami  Bank Bangladesh Ltd, issued two notices, firstly on  1-3-2007 and secondly on 21-6-2007 . The com-  plainant opposite party No.2 filed complaint petition  on 24-7-2007, the learned Magistrate took cog-  nizance on 24-7-2007 against the accused petitioner  under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments  Act, 1881.    ",
      "16. Now the point for determination is whether  the complainant opposite party No.2 has filed the  complaint as per the provision of section 138(1)(c)  and section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act  and whether the accused petitioner is entitled to get  any relief of the application under section 561A of  the Code of Criminal Procedure.    ",
      "15. On perusal of the above facts, it appears  that the complainant opposite party No.2 has ful-  filled two conditions this is, he presented the cheque  within the period of its validity and he has also made  a demand by giving notice in writing within 30 days  of the receipt of information from the bank regard.  ing the return of the cheque as unpaid.    ",
      "14. There is no denying of the fact that the  accused petitioner issued two cheques to repay the  money in favour of the opposite party No.2 Islami  Bank Bangladesh Ltd. On 20-2-2007, that com-  plainant placed the cheques for encashment to the  Agrani Bank on 20-2-2007 within 6(six) months or  within its validity but the cheques were dishonoured    on the same day due to insufficiency of fund and  that the complainant served legal notice in writing  on 21-6-2007 upon the accused petitioner within 30  days the receipt of information regarding return of  cheques unpaid as per section 138(1)(b) of the  Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.    ",
      "13. Now the point for determination is (i)  whether the petitioner filed the case satisfying the  provisions of law and (ii) whether taking cognizance  of the offence in this case is in contravention of law  and (iii) whether the continuation of the case is  legal.    ",
      "12. From the above provisions, we find the fol-  lowing three different propositions which have been  supported by our apex Court.  <br>  (i) acheque can be presented for encashment  on any number of occasions within the  period of its validity and its dishonour on  every occasion will give rise to a fresh  ‘Cause of action’ within the meaning of  clause (b) of section 141 of the Negotiable  Instruments Act so as to entitle the payee  to institute prosecution under section 138  on the basis of the last cause of action;  <br>  (ii) A cheque can be presented for encash-  ment on any number of occasions within  the period of its validity but there can be  only one cause of action under section  141(b) arising from its last dishonour and <br>  (iii) Only for the first dishonour and not sub-  sequent dishonour can a prosecution  under section 138 be instituted as per sec-  tion 138(c) read with section 141(b)  envisages only one cause of action in    respect of one and the same cheque.    ",
      "11. From the plain reading of the above section  it is manifest that a competent court can take cog-  nizance of a written complaint of an offence under  section 138 it is made within one month of the date  on which the cause of action arises under clause (c)  of the proviso of section 138 . — (emphasis supplied)     ",
      "10. Now let us see the provision of section 141  of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which runs as  follows : <br>   “141 . Cognizance of offences—Notwith-  standing any thing contained in the Code of  <br>  Criminal Procedure 1898.  <br>  (a) No court shall take cognizance of any  offence punishable under section 138  except upon a complaint, in writing,  made by the payee or, as the case may  be, the holder in due course of the  cheque;  <br>  (b) Such complaint is made within one  month of the date on which the cause of  action arises under clause (c) of the pro-  viso to section 138.  <br>  (c) no court inferior to that of a court of ses:  sions shall try any offence punishable  under section 138.\"                 ",
      "9. Ona careful analysis of section 138 of the  Negotiable Instruments Act, it is seen that its main  part creates an offence when a cheque is returned by  the bank unpaid for any of the reasons mentioned  therein, The significant fact however, is that the pro-  viso lays down three conditions precedent to the  applicability of the above section and, for that mat-  ter, creation of such offence and the conditions are:  (i) the cheque should have been presented to the  bank within’ six months of its issue or within the  period of its validity whichever is earlier; (ii) payee  should have made a demand for payment by regis-  tered notice after the cheque is returned unpaid; and  (iii) that the drawer should have failed to pay the  amount within 30 days of the receipt of notice. It is  only when all the above three conditions are satis-  fied that a prosecution can be launched for the  offence under section 138.    ",
      "8. In order to appreciate the submission made  by the leamed Advocates for the accused petitioner  and the opposite party No.2, let us now sce whether  the complainant opposite party No.2 has filed the  case before the leamed Magistrate strictly comply-  ing with the provision of law envisaged under sec-  tion 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act  and whether the proceedings under section 561A of.  the Code of Criminal Procedure is liable to be  quashed. Now let us see the section 138 of the  Negotiable Instrument act which reads as follows :  <br>  \"138 . Dishonour of cheque for insufficien-  cy, etc. of funds in the account (1)—Where any  cheque drawn by a person on an account main-  tained by him with a banker for payment of any  amount of money to another person from out of  that account is returned by the bank unpaid,  either because of the amount of money standing  to the credit of that account is insufficient to  dishonour the cheque or that it exceeds that  amount arranged to be paid from that account  by an agreement made with that bank, such per-  son shall be deemed to have committed an  offence and shall, without prejudice to any  other provisions of this Act, be punished with  imprisonment for a term which may extend to  one year, or with fine which may extend to  (thrice) the amount of the cheque, or with both;    Provided that nothing contained in this sec-  tion shall apply unless—  <br>  (a) the cheque has been presented to the  bank within a period of six months  from the date on which it is drawn or  within the period of its validity,  whichever is earlier;  <br>  (b) The payee or the holder in due course  of the cheque, as the case may be,  makes a demand for the payment of  the paid amount of money by giving a  notice, in writing, to the drawer of the  cheque, within thirty days of the  receipt of information by him from  the bank regarding the return of the  cheque as unpaid, and  <br>  (c) The drawer of such cheque fails to  make the payment of the said amount  of money to the payee or, as the case  may be, to the holder in due course of  the cheque, within (thirty days) of the  receipt of the said notice.    ",
      "7. The learned Advocate for the Opposite  party No.2 complainant on the other hand submits  that the chief Metropolitan Magistrate took cog-  nizance of the offence on the basis of complain-peti-  tion which had not filed in accordance with the pro-  visions of the Negotiable Instruments Act; that the  case was initiated on 24-7-2007 after the expiry of 4  months 20 days from issuance of first notice as the  accused petitioner verbally prayed for time and that  though the case was filed before one day before the  expiry of one month from the date of receipt of the  second notice, the proceedings cannot be quashed  readily when from the materials on record it appears  a prima facie case of committing offence against the  accused petitioner and as such the Rule should be  discharged.                 ",
      "6. He further submits that the second notice  was served upon the petitioner on 21-6-2007 and the    petitioner received the notice on 25-6-2007; that the |  petitioner will get 1(one) month's time from the >    date of receipt of the notice but the complainant  filed the instant case before expiry of one month. [t  is further submitted that cause of action arises one  month after the issuance of notice under clause of  the proviso to section 138 but complaint was filed  long after the statutory period and, as such, petition  under section 561A of the Code of Criminal  Procedure is liable to be quashed,    ",
      "5. Mr Shah Md Munir Sharif, the learneq  Advocate for the accused petitioner submits that  notice under section 138(1)(b) of the Negotiable  Instruments Act was issued on 1-3-2007 and that  there is nothing in complaint petition when the saiq  notice was actually served upon the petitioner and  that the instant proceeding was initiated on 24-7.  2007 afier expiry of 4 months 20 days from issuance  of the said notice which is against the provision of  law.    ",
      "4. The learned Magistrate on receipt of the  petition of complain took cognizance of the case  against the accused petitioner under section 138 of  the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 . The accused  petitioner surrendered before the court with prayer  for bail and he was enlarged on bail. There after the  case has been transferred to the court of the Learned  Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Chittagong who on  tum transferred the case to the court of the Learned  Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge. the  accused petitioner appeared before the court of the  learned Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge,  Chittagong who has been pleased to grant him bail  vide his order dated 27-11-2007,    There after the accused petitioner filed a mis-  cellaneous case before this court under section 561A  of the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained a    Rule in which the further proceedings have been  stayed.    ",
      "3. It is further stated that complainant on 20-  2-2007 placed the above mentioned cheques for  encashment to the Agrani Bank but the cheques  were dishonoured with a remark “#facet “tal  a1 GH ARI\" and that there after the complainant  served a legal notice dated 21-6-2007 upon the  accused to repay the money and the accused  received the legal notice on 25-6-2007 . The com-  plainant further stated that he took the shelter of the  court after failing to get the money. Hence the case.    ",
      "2. Necessary facts for the purpose of disposal  of this Rule is that, the complainant opposite party  No.2 Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited filed CR  Case No.138 of 2007 in the court of Chief Metro-  politan Magistrate, Chittagong under section 138 of  the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 stating inter  alia that the complainant opposite party allowed  Letter of Credit facilities in favour of accused peti-  tioner, Md Rafiqul Islam, which were expired on 22-  12-2005 and 1-5-2006; that the liability of the  accused stands at Taka 70, 63, 291 including profit  with compensation and the accused became default-  er borrower and that in this regard in order to repay  the money the accused issued to cheques amounting  to Taka 9,00,000 bearing cheque No. Gha 0629585  dated 20-2-2007 and amounting to Taka 2,00,000  bearing Cheque No. Gha 629586 dated 20-2-2007 in  favour of the complainant, which was drawn with    the Agrani Bank, Fishing Centre Branch EPZ  Chittagong.    ",
      "1.   Since the complainant filed the complaint  after expiry of the statutory period of 30 days  from the date of issuance of notice under proviso  of section 138(1)(b) of the Act and as such taking  cognizance of complaint by the Magistrate was  not legal and since taking of cognizance is illegal.  the continuation of the proceeding will create    abuse of the process of the Court. wvese(24)    SM Anwar Hossain vs Md Shafiul Alam $1 DLR  (AD) 218 and Ali Akkas vs Enayet Hossain 1997 BLD  (AD) 44 = 2 BLC (AD) 16 ref.  <br>  Shah Md Munir Sharif with AKM Nurul Alam, Md  Imran Jahangir and Abdul Momin Chowdhury, Advocates  —For the Petitioner.  <br>  Shahidul Islam, Deputy Attorney-General—For the  State.   <br><br> Mojibur Rahman Miah, Advocate—For the Opposite  Party No.2.   <br> Judgment  <br>  Siddiqur Rahman Miah J : This Rule on an  application filed under section 561A of the Code of  Criminal Procedure was issued upon the opposite  parties to show cause as to shy the proceedings in  CR Case No.138 of 2007 under section 138 of the  Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 now pending in the  court of the learned Additional Metropolitan  Sessions Judge, Chittagong should not be quashed.  <br>  *Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.2369 of 2008.

      "21. The order of stay passed at the time of issu-  ing of the Rule is vacated.    Let a copy of this judgment and order be sent to  the Court concerned at once of information.

",
      "20. In the result, the Rule is discharged.    ",
      "19. In view of the facts and circumstances of  the case as Stated above, we are inclined to hold that  there is no substance in the Rule and, as such, it is  jiable to be discharged.    ",
      "18. Court is to record the reasons for discharg-  ing the accused under section 241A of the Code, but  no such reasons are required to be recorded in farm-  ing charge against the accused as per provisions of                 section 242 of the Code, The learned Special Judge  framed charge against the accused-petitioner after  hearing both the parties and being satisfied that  there was ground for framing of charge. Therefore,  we find no illegality in framing of charge against the  accused-petitioner and there is no ground of setting  aside the impugned order.    ",
      "17. The contention of the learned Advocate for  the accused-petitioner is that a Sub-Inspector of  Police of Kafrul Police Station investigated into the  case in part and recorded the statements of some  witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure by violating the mandatory provisions of  Section 20 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act,  2004 and, as such, the proceeding is illegal. On  perusal of Annexure C series it appears that Md  Mazibar Rahman, Sub-Inspector of Police of Kafrul  Police Station, DMP Dhaka, recorded the statements  of witnesses Md Sanwar Hossain, Md Alauddin-al-  Masum, Md Mohin and Shahidullah under section  161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But the  accused-petitioner did not challenge the proceeding  of the case. In the instance case, the accused-peti-  tioner has challenged the legality of framing of  charge against him.    ",
      "16. On perusal of the impugned order dated 6-  7-2009 it appears that the learned Special Judge  observed all the legal formalities as stated in the  aforesaid section 241A and 242 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure in rejecting the application for  discharge and framing of charge against the  accused-petitioner.    ",
      "15. Section. 242 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure relates to framing of charge against the  accused which reads as under :  <br>  \"242 . Charge to be framed—If, after such  consideration and hearing as aforesaid, the  Magistrate is of opinion that there is ground for  presuming that the accused has committed an  offence, the Magistrate shall frame a formal  charge relating to the offence of which he is  accused and he shall be asked whether he  admits that he has committed the offence with  which he is charged.\"    ",
      "14. Section 241A of the Code of Criminal  Procedure relates to discharge of accused person  which reads as under :  <br>  \"241A—When accused shall be dis-  charged. When the accused appears or is  brought before the Magistrate, and if the  Magistrate, upon consideration of the record of  the case and the documents submitted therewith  and making such examination, if any, of the  accused as the Magistrate thinks necessary and  after giving the prosecution and the accused an  Opportunity of being heard, considers the    charge to be groundless, he shall discharge the  accused and record his reasons for so doing.”    ",
      "13. In order to appreciate the said point raised  by the accused-petitioner reference may be made to  the relevant provisions of law.    ",
      "12. The contention of the accused-petitioner is  that the First Information Report did not disclose  any offence punishable under section 165A of the  Penal Code and that the charge was framed without  having found any ground and materials on record  and that a Sub-Inspector of the Police recorded the  statements of some witnesses under section 161 of  the Code of Criminal Procedure which is violation  of the mandatory provision of section 20 of the Anti-  Corruption Commission Act and that no inquiry  held in the instant case which is violation of the  mandatory provisions of Rule 6 of the Anti-  Corruption Commission Rules and in the circum-  stances, the impugned order of framing of charge  dated 6-7-2009, rejecting the prayer for discharge  under section 241A of the Code of Criminal  Procedure is liable to be set aside.    ",
      "11. Ordinarily, criminal proceeding instituted  against an accused person must be tried under the  provisions of law and the said proceeding should not  be generally interfered with at an interlocutory stage.    ",
      "10. In the instant case the only point to be  decided in whether the impugned order of framing  of charge against the accused petitioner is liable to  be set aside.    ",
      "9. Perused the Revisional Application filed  under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Proce-                 dure, the Annexure annexed therewith, the impug-  ned order of framing of charge and the case record.    ",
      "8. Mr Khandker Modarresh Elahi (Tiru), the  learned Assistant Attorney-General appearing for  the State-Opposite Party No.1 has endorsed the sub-  missions made by the learned Advocate Mr Md  Khurshid Alam Khan for the Anti-Corruption  Commission-Opposite Party No.2.    ",
      "7. Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan, the learned  Advocate appearing for the Anti-Corruption  Commission-Opposite Party No.2 opposes the Rule  alleging, inter alia, that the first information report  has disclosed the offence punishable under section  165A/332 against the accused-petitioner and the co-  accused and that the Anti-Corruption Commission  has investigated into the case and submitted charge-  sheet having found prima facie case agianst the  accused-petitioner and the co-accused and consider-  ing the materials on record and having found suffi-  cient ground, the learned Special Judge has framed  charge against the accused-petitioner and the co-  accused and that there is no illegality in framing  charge and in the circumstances, the Rule is liable to  be discharged.    ",
      "6. Mr Syed Haider Ali, the learned Advocate  for the accused-petitioner submits that the accused-  petitioner is innocent and that’he has been falsely  implicated in this case and that the first information  teport did not disclose any offence of section 165A  of the Penal Code and that no inquiry was held as  per provisions of Anti-Corruption Commission  Rules and that the investigation of the case was not  held as per provisions of the Anti-Corruption Com-  mission Act, 2004 and Anti-Corruption Commission  Rules, 2007 and in the circumstances, the impugned  order of framing of charge dated 6-7-2009 is liable  to be set aside.    ",
      "5. Heard the learned Advocate Mr Syed  Haider Ali for the accused-petitioner, the learned  Assistant Attorney-General Mr Khandker Modar-  resh Elahi (Tiru) for the State-Opposite Party No.1  and Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan for the Anti-  Corruption Commission-Opposite Party No.2.    ",
      "4. The accused persons were put on trial  before the learned Special Judge, Court No.4,  Dhaka. The accused-petitioner moved an applica-  tion under section 241A of the Code of Criminal  Procedure for discharge. The learned Special Judge,  Court No.4, Dhaka, rejected the prayer for discharge  and framed charge against the accused-petitioner  and another on 6-7-2009 and being aggrieved by  and dissatisfied with the impugned order of framing  of charge the accused-petitioner has filed this  Revisional Application under section 439 of the  Code of Criminal Procedure for setting aside the  ‘mpugned order and obtained the instant Rule.    ",
      "3. After investigation the Anti-Corruption  Commission submitted a report against 2 (two)  accused persons including the accused-petitioner  under Rule 10 of the Anti-Corruption Rules, 2007  with a recommendation to stand their trial for the  offence punishable under section 165A/332 of the  Penal Code.    ",
      "2. In short, the facts relevant for disposal of  this Rule are as follows : <br>   One Md Ali Ahmed Masud (PPM), Sub-  Inspector of Police of Kafrul Police Station, DMP  Dhaka, being informant, lodged an ejahar on 11-10-  2007 with the Kafrul Police Station, DMP Dhaka,  alleging, inter alia, that on the same date at about 20-  00 hours he was recording the statements of accused  Md Amanullah and co-accused Swapon in his  Office in connection with a Memo No.D/3960/DC  (Mirpur Division) Dated 1-1-2007 when accused  Md Amanullah offered him Taka 3,800 as bribe in  order to act in their favour. The informant arrested  the accused-petitioner and seized the money by  preparing seizure list in presence of the witnesses,  but co-accused Swapon fled away.    ",
      "1.   Court is to record the reasons for discharg-  ing the accused under section 241A of the Code,  but no such reasons are required to be recorded  in farming charge against the accused as per pro-  visions of section 242 of the Code. The Special  Judge framed charge against the accused-peti-  tioner after hearing both the parties and being  satisfied that there was ground for framing of  charge. No illegality in framing of charge against  the accused-petitioner and there is no ground of  setting aside the impugned order.    Syed Haider Ali, Advocate—For the Accused-Peti-  tioner.    Khandker Modarresh Elahi (Tiru), Assistant Attor-  ney-General—For the State-Opposite Party No.1.    Md Khurshid Alam Khan, Advocate — For the ACC-  Opposite Party No.2.  <br>  Judgment  <br>  Md Abdus Samad J : This Rule, at the instance  of accused-petitioner Md Amanullah, was issued  calling upon the opposite-party to show cause as to  why the impugned order of framing of charge dated  6-7-2009 passed by the learned Special Judge, Court  No.4, Dhaka, rejecting the application filed for dis-  charge of the accused-petitioner under section 241 A  <br>  *Criminal Revision No.1451 of 2009.                 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Special Case  No.21 of 2009 arising out of Kafrul PS Case No.30  dated 11-10-2007 under section 165A of the Penal  Code should not be set aside and/or such other or  further order or orders passed as to this Court might  seem fit and proper.    ",
      "8. In the case of Sattya Narayan Podder vs  State reported in 53 DLR 403 their Lordships of a  Division Bench of this Court have held that if the  cause of action is matured during pendency of the  proceeding, the defect of pre-maturity of cause of  action could be cured and observed as follows : <br>   \"Though the case was filed before expiry  of 15 days time, the accused had the opportuni-  ty to make the payment within 15 days. Had  such payment been made within 15 days even  after filing of the complaint, in that case, the  proceeding could be quashed. As he failed to  make the payment, if now we hold that the case  cannot be maintained, the complainant cannot  file a fresh case because no Court will be able   ",
      "7. Their Lordships of our Appellate Division,  in the case of Nizam Uddin Mahmood vs Abdul  Hamid reported in 60 DLR (AD) 195, have held that  since the date of receipt of legal notice is a question  of fact to be ascertained at the time of trial non-dis-  closure of such fact in the complaint petition cannot  render the proceeding liable to be quashed to the  great prejudice of the complainant who is entitled to  prove his case on evidence. In view of this decision,  we hold that though the date of service of the legal  notice upon the petitioner has not been mentioned in  the petition of complaint, non-disclosure of the same  is not a ground for quashment of the proceeding as  it is a question of fact to be ascertained at the time  of trial. Therefore, the first ground raised by Mr  Hasan does not stand.    ",
      "6. We have heard the submissions of both the  sides and perused the application under section  561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure along with  the petition of complaint.    ",
      "403. He further submits that the case has been filed  in compliance with the legal requirements under  sections 138 and 141 of the Act and, as such, there  is no reason to quash the proceeding of the CR Case,  Thus, he concludes his argument by submitting that  the Rule is liable to be discharged.    ",
      "5. On the other hand, Mr AKM Foez, learned  Advocate appearing for the opposite party No.2 sub-  mits that whether or not the legal notice was served  upon the petitioner and non-disclosure of the date of  the notice in the complaint petition are questions of  fact to be ascertained at the time of trial. In support  of his submission he has referred to the case deci-  sion reported in 60 DLR (AD) 195 . As regards the  defect of pre-maturity of cause of action, the learned  Advocate submits that though the case was filed  before expiry of the time limit without affording the  petitioner an opportunity to pay the amount of the  dishonoured cheques, but the defect of pre-maturity  of cause of action has been cured during pendency    of the instant CR case. In support of his contention,  he has relied on the decision reported in 53 DLR  ",
      "4. Mr JBM Hasan, learned Advocate appear-  ing on behalf of the petitioner attacks the proceeding  of the CR case on two grounds. Firstly, he submits  that there is no disclosure of fact in the petition of  complaint that the legal notice was served upon the  petitioner and as such, cause of action has not aris-  en and the proceeding of the CR case was initiated  illegally which is liable to be quashed, He secondly  submits that the legal notice was issued on 12-4-  2007 and the case was filed on 30-4-2007 by not  giving thirty days time to the petitioner for payment  of the amount of the dishonoured cheques and as  such, the case was filed before cause of action has  arisen. Thus, he submits that the proceeding of the  CR case has been initiated in violation of mandato-  ry time limits prescribed under sections 138 and 141  of the Act and the continuation of the proceeding  would be a sheer abuse of the process of Court  which must be prevented by quashing the proceed-  ing of the case. Thus, he submits that the Rule is  liable to be made absolute.    ",
      "3. The relevant facts for disposal of the Rule  are that the opposite party No.2 Senoara Begum as  complainant filed the petition of complaint of the  above CR case in the Court of Chief Metropolitan  Magistrate, Chittagong on 30-4-2007 stating, inter  alia, that on 8-10-2006 the petitioner-accused Md  Solaiman took Taka 12,00,000 from her for his busi-  ness purpose on the condition that he would return  the money within a month. After expiry of that time,  the complainant demanded the said money and the  petitioner issued two cheques, both dated 8-3-2007.  one for Taka 2,00,000 and another for Taka  10,00,000 in favour of the complainant, who on 29-  3-2007 presented both the cheques for encashment  in the concerned bank, but the same were dishon-  oured on the same day for insufficient fund. He  thereafter sent a legal notice on 12-4-2007 to the  petitioner which was returned on 26-4-2007 . The  petitioner did not pay the dishonoured cheque  amount to the complainant in time and thereby com                 mitted the offence under section 138 of the Act. The  learned Magistrate took cognizance of offence  under section 138 of the Act and the petitioner sur-  rendered in the Court of Magistrate and he was  enlarged on bail, Thereatter, he has come to this  Court and filed this application under section 561A  of the Code of Criminal Procedure challenging the  proceedings of the CR case and obtained the Rule  and order of stay.    ",
      "2. By the Rule issuing order dated 9-3-2008,  all further proceedings of the above mentioned CR  case were stayed.    ",
      "1.   Since the cheques issued by the petitioner  were dishonoured for insufficient fund and he  failed to pay the amount of the dishonoured  cheques in time, offence under section 138 of the  Act has been disclosed agianst him. The facts  narrated in the complaint do constitute prima  facie offence under section 138 of the Act and as  such, question of quashing the proceeding does    not arise. eovese(10)    ——————————_—  *Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.3620 of 2008.   <br>   Nizam Uddin Mahmood vs Abdul Hamid 60 DLR  (AD) 195; Sattya Narayan Podder vs State 53 DLR 403  and Sattya Narayan Podder vs State 53 DLR 403 ref.
