    "section": "640. Now let us test the constitutionality of the Constitution (fifth amendment) Act, 1979 . This amendment Act sought to legalise the following among others : <br> (i) The seizure of office of President of Bangladesh by Khondaker Moshta- que Ahmed on August 15, 1975. <br> (ii) Change of Article 48, 55 and 142 of the constitution by Khondaker  Moshtaque Ahmed. <br> (iii) proclamation of Martial Law <br> (iv)Made the Constitution subordinate and subservient to the Proclamation of Martial Law. <br> (v) Ousted the jurisdiction of Court including the Supreme court <br> (vi)Nomination of Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem as President of Bangladesh on November 6, 1975 <br> (vii)Proclamation issued on November 8, 1975, and assumption of the powers of Chief Martial Law Administrator, <br> (viii) Dissolution of the National Assembly <br> (ix) Omission of the Bangladesh Colla- borators (Special Tribunal) Order, 1972,       <br> (x) Deletion of proviso to Article 38 of the Constitution, <br> (xi) Deletion of the amendments made by the Fourth Amendment of the Consti- tution, save and except the provisions in respect of the office of the President, the control and discipline of Subordinate Courts and also Article 116A. <br> (xii)Proclamation dated November, 1976, appointing Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc, the Chief of Army Staff, as the Chief Martial Law Administrator, <br> (xiii) Various Proclamation Orders, Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders <br> (xiv) Nomination of Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc., as the President of Bangladesh by an Order dated April 21, 1977. <br> (xv)Change of the Preamble and Article 6, &, 9, 10, 11, 25, 42, 93 and 142 of the Constitution and addition of Article 92A therein. <br> (xvi) Paragraph 3A to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, legalising all Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the actions taken thereon, which were kept out side the jurisdiction of the Court, <br> (xvii) The Referendum Order, 1977 (Martial Law Order No. | of 1977) dated May 1, 1977 and various other Proclamations, MLRs, MLOs etc. including Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 and the actions taken thereon, till the lifting of the Martial Law on April 7, 1979.  The election of the Second Parliament was con- ducted in February, 1979, during Martial Law. At that time, Lieutenant General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc., was the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator. <br> The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, was passed on April 6, 1979, legalizing all the Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations, Martial Law Orders and the actions taken thereon, some of which are mentioned above. <br> Any common man of ordinary prudence would say that the enormity of illegality sought to be legal- ized by this Act, would have shocked the Chief Justice Coke so much so that it would have left him dumb instead of saying that ‘when an Act of Parliament is against right and reason, or repugnant .......................... the common law will control it and adjudge that Act to be void’. <br> Perhaps, it would also leave the Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, out of his comprehension, if he would found that ‘after a formal written Constitution has been lawfully adopted by a compe- tent body and has been generally accepted by the people including the judiciary as the Constitution of the country’, an army commander can have the audacity to change the Constitution beyond recogni- tion and transfiguring a secular Bangladesh into a theocratic State. <br> Perhaps the US Supreme Court would have kept mum instead of holding that the guarantee of due process bars Congress from enactments that ‘shock the sense of fair play’.  But what duty is cast upon us, It is ordained that we must not keep our eyes shut, rather, we are bound by our oath that we must see and appreciate the facts and the law in its proper perceptive.   "

Coming back to Bangladesh, Mustafa  Kamal, CJ was emphatic in respect of the independ-  ence of Judiciary in Secretary, Ministry of Finance  vs Masdar Hossain 2000 BLT (AD) 234 where his  Lordship held at para 44, page-257-8 : <br> “44 . ..................The independence of the  judiciary, as affirmed and declared by Articles  94(4) and 116A, is one of the basic pillars of the  Constitution and cannot be demolished, whit-: tled down, curtailed or diminished in any man- ner whatsoever, except under the existing pro- visions of the Constitution. It is true that this independence, as emphasised by the learned  Attorney-General, is subject to the provisions  of the Constitution, but we find no provision in the Constitution which curtails, diminishes or  otherwise abridges this independence. ..... <br> His Lordship further held at para-60, pages-  263-4: “60....... When Parliament and the  executive instead of implementing the provi- sions of Chapter II of Part VI follow a different course not sanctioned by the Constitution, the higher Judiciary is within its jurisdiction to bring back the Parliament and the executive from constitutional derailment and give neces- sary directions to follow the constitutional course. This exercise was made by this Court in the case of Kudrat-e-Elahi panir vs Bangla- desh, 44 DLR(AD) 319 . We don't see why the High Court Division or this Court cannot repeat that exercise when a constitutional deviation is  detected and when there is a constitutional man- date to implement certain provisions of the Constitution.\" (The underlinings are mine) <br> Latifur Rahman J (as his Lordship hen was) also held so at para 76 page 271 <br> \"76 . The written Constitution of Bangladesh has placed the Supreme Court in the place of the guardian of the Constitution itself. It will not countenance to any inroad upon the Constitution. A referencee to Articles 94, 95, 96, and 147 of the Constitution clearly reveal the independent character of the  Supreme Court.\" (The underlinings are mine)   "

His Lordship then considers the powers of the Court in respect of the Constitutional measure at page-71 : <br> “I for my part cannot conceive of a situa tion, in which, afler a formal written Constitution has been lawfully adopted i A competent body and has been generally accept- ed by the people including the judiciary as the Constitution of the country, the judiciary can claim to declare any of its provisions ultra vires or void. This will be no part of its function of interpretation. Therefore, in my view, however solemn or sacrosanct a document. if it is not incorporated in the Constitution or does not form a part thereof it cannot control the Constitution. At any rate, the Courts created under the Constitution will not have the power to_declare_any_ provision of the constitution itself. as being in violation of such a document, If in fact that document contains the expression of the will of the vast majority of the people, then the remedy for correcting such a violation will lie with the people and not with the judici- ary ........ if it appears only as a preamble to the Constitution, then it will serve the same purpose as any other preamble serves, namely, that in the case of any doubt as to the intent of the law-maker, it may be looked at to ascertain the true intent, but it cannot control the substantive provisions thereof. This does not, however, mean that the validity of no Constitutional measure can be tested in the Courts. ‘if a constitutional measure is adopted in a manner different to that prescribed in the constitution itself or is passed by a lesser num- ber_of votes than those_specified in the Constitution then the validity of such a measure may well be questioned and adjudicated wpov. This, however, will be possible only in the case of a Constitutional amendment but generally                 not in the case of a first or a new Constitution, unless the powers of the Constitution-making date to  body itself are limited by some supra-Constitu-  tional document.” (The underlinings are mine)  We do not have any doubts about the correct-  ness of the Constitutional position so lucidly  explained above although stated in the back-ground  of the Interim Constitution of Pakistan, 1972, but it  is true, in general, of any written Constitution.

His Lordship further explains the nature of the power of the Court at page-70 : <br> “In exercising this power, the judiciary claims no supremacy over other organs of the Government but acts only as the administrator of the public will. Even when it declares a leg- islative measure unconstitutional and void, it does not do so, because, the judicial power is superior in degree or dignity to the legislative power, but because the Constitution has vested it with the power to declare what the law is in the cases which come before it. It thus merely enforces the Constitution as a paramount law whenever a legislative enactment comes into conflict with it because, it is its duty to see that the Constitution prevails. It is only when the Legislature fails to keep within its own Constitutional limits, the judiciary steps in to enforce compliance with the Constitution, This is no doubt a delicate task as pointed out in the case of Fazlul Quader Chowdhury vs Shah Nawaz, which has to be performed with great circumspection but it has nevertheless to be per- formed as a sacred Constitutional duty when other State functionaries disregard the limita- tions imposed upon them or claim to exercise power which the people have been careful to whithold from them.\"  "

It is true that like the Supreme Courts in the United States or in India, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has got the power of review of both leg- islative and executive actions but such power of review would not place the Supreme Court with any higher position to those of the other two Branches of the Republic. The Supreme Court is the creation of the Constitution just like the Legislature and the Executive. But the Constitution endowed the Supreme Court with such power of judicial review and since the Judges of the Supreme Court have taken oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, they are obliged and duty bound to                declare and strike down any provision of law which is Inconsistent with the Constitution without any fear or favour to any body, This includes the power to declare any provision seeking to oust the jurisdic ton of the Court, as ultra vires to the Constitution.

This Constitution may be termed as controlled or rigid but incontradistinction to a Federal form of Government, as in the United States, it has a Parliamentary form of Government within limits set by the Constitution. Like the United States, its three grand Departments, ‘the Legislature makes, the Executive executes and judiciary con- strues the law’ (Chief Justice Marshall), constituting a trichotomy of power in the Republic under the Constitution. But the Bangladesh Parliament lacks the omnipotence of the British Parliament while the President is not the executive head like the US President but the Prime Minister is, like British Prime Minister, However, all the functionaries of the Republic owe their existence, powers and functions to the Constitution. ‘We the people of Bangladesh’, gave themselves this Constitution which is con- ceived of as a fundamental or an organic or a Supreme Law rising lofty high above all other laws in the country and Article 7(2) expressly spelt out that any law which is inconsistent with this Constitution, to that extent of the inconsistency, is void. As such, the provisions of the Constitution is the basis on which the vires of all other existing laws and those passed by the Legislature as well as the actions of the Executive, are to be judged by the Supreme Court, under its power of judicial review. This power of judicial review of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is, similar to those in the United States and in India.  "

Since Marbury vs Madison (1803), the US Supreme Court went a long way in expounding the Constitution, a vigorous taproot, in the language of Woodraw Wilson, into a vast constitutional sys- tem. The process how the American Constitutional system has been developed can be understood from the oft quoted observation of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, as observed by Lord Denning : <br> “The rule in the United States is not con- tained in their Constitution itself. It is a judge- made rule. It was stated by Chief Justice Marshall in 1803 in the Marbury case. Later on Charles Evans Hughes, the tenth Chief Justice, in 1908 firmly declared : <br> ‘We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is and the judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty and our property under the Constitution.’ <br> Their Constitution nowhere provides that it shall be what the judges say it is. Yet it has become the most fundamental and far reaching principle of American constitutional Jaw.” (Quoted from Lord Denning : ‘What Next In The Law’ at page-318 of First Indian Reprint, 1993).  "

He further says, “what is necessary is to have Judges who are prepared to fashion new tools, forge new methods, innovate new strategies and evolve a new jurisprudence, who are judicial states- men with a social vision and a creative faculty and who have, above all, a deep sense of commitment to the Constitution with a activist approach and obliga- tion for accountability, not to any party in power nor to the opposition ..........0...00.0e. We need Judges who are alive to the socio-economic realities of Indian life, who are anxious to wipe every tear from every eye, who have faith in the constitutional val- ues and who are ready to use law as an instrument for achieving the constitutional objectives (at page 179). He quoted the eloquent words of Justice Krishna lyer ; <br> “Independence of the judiciary is not genv- flexion; nor is it Opposition to every proposition of Government, It is neither judiciary made to Opposition measure nor Government’s pleas- ure”,        <br>         There is no hesitation in saying that these are the words of wisdom handed down to us by the generations of Judges who very politely and meekly from the beginning of the civilisation Reminded the monarch that the King is not above the law but under the law. Some of them were beheaded, imprisoned or destroyed but the cherished theme ran like a refrain throughout the pages of the history.”  "

This point may now be considered. Independence of judiciary is not an abstract conception. Bhagwati, J, said “if there is one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it is the judici- ary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the Jaw and thereby making the rule of law a mean- ingful and effective’. He said that the Judges must uphold the core principle of the rule of law which says, “Be you ever so high, the law is above you”. This is the principle of independ- ence of the judiciary which is vital for the estab- lishment of real participatory democracy, main- tenance of the rule of law as a dynamic concept and delivery of social justice to the vulnerable sections of the Community. It is this principle of independence of the judiciary which must be kept in mind while interpreting the relevant pro- visions of the Constitution (SP Gupta vs President of India and others AIR 1982 SC at page 152).

Hamoodur Rahman, CJ in dealing with Martial Law provision in Asma Jilani’s case held at page -202 : <br> “However, as this question has been raised, regarding the validity of Martial Law Regu- lation No. 78, I must point out that it follows from what I have said earlier that it was made by an authority whose legal competence we have not been able to recognise on the ground of want of legal authority and the unconstitu- tional manner of arrogation of pwer.\" <br> His Lordship further held at page-204 : <br> “Reverting now to the question of the legality of the Presidential Order No, 3 of 1969 and the Martial Law Regulation No. 78 of 1971 it follows from the reasons given earlier that they were both made by an incompetent authot- ity and therefore lacked the attribute of legiti- macy which is one of the essential characteris- tics of a valid law. The Presidential Onder No.3 of 1969 was also invalid on two additional grounds, namely, that it was a Presidential Order, which could not in terms of the Provi- sional Constitution Order itself amend the Constitution so as to take away the jurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts under Article 98 and that it certainly could not, in any event, take away the judicial power of the Courts to hear and determine questions pertainingeven to their own jurisdiction and this power could not be vested in another authority as long as the Courts continued to exist.\" <br> Yaqub Ali, J, also held in the same vein at p -237 : <br> “As both President's Order No. 3 of 1969 and Martial Law Regulation 78 were intended to deny to the Courts the performance of their judicial functions an object opposed to the con- cept of law, Neither would be recognized by Courts as law,” <br> The moral is clear.

In that detention case, the High Court held that they had no jurisdiction to enquire into the matter because of an ouster clause in The Jurisdiction of Courts (Removal of Doubts) Order, 1969 (President’s Order No. 3 of 1969). In that premises, this is how Hamoodur Rahman, C J, dealt with the controversy in Asma Jilani s Case in setting her father, Malik Ghulam Jilani, free, at page-197- 199 ; <br> “This provision, as very appropriately pointed out by Mr Brohi, strikes at the very root of the judicial power of the Court to hear and determine a matter, even though it may relate to its own jurisdiction. The Courts undoubtedly                have the power to hear and determine any mat- ter or controversy which is brought before them, even if it be to decide whether they have the jurisdiction to determine such a matter or not. The superior Courts are, as is now W ell set- tled, the Judges of their own jurisdiction. This is a right which has consistently been claimed by this and other Courts of superior jurisdiction in all civilised countries .. .(Page-197)  Learned Attorney-General does not seri- ously dispute the correctness of the contention that “judicial power” is different from “jurisdic tion” * and so faras judicial power is concemed it must exist in courts as long as the courts are there. In fact, he has been bold enough, and I admire him for his boldness, in characterising these provisions of the Presidential Order No. 3 of 1969, which seek to take away the judicial power itself as “absurdities”. He frankly con- power itself as absurdities. He frankly con- cedes that the Courts have and must have the power to determine all questions of their own jurisdiction. It is a proposition so well-settled that no one can challenge it. <br> The learned Attorney-General has, howev- er, sought to contend that where there is a writ- ten Constitution the Courts are themselves crea- tures of the Constitution and have only such jurisdictions as the Constitution chooses to con- fer upon them. I have no cavil with this propo- sition, as I have myself is several cases indicat- ed that the constitution can confer or restrict the jurisdiction of even superior courts but this is not the same thing as saying that it can also restrict or curtail the judicial pwer because that in effect would be denying to the court the very function for which it exists. i.e. to decide a controversy even if it relates to its own jurisdic- tion. <br> In the view that I have taken of the President Order No. 3 1969 that it is a sub- constitutional legislation I cannot but hold that it could not have curtailed the jurisdiction that was given to the High Courts and to this Court by the Constitution of 1962, for, that jurisdic- tion was preserved even by the Provisional Constitution Order. <br> Looking at the matter, therefore, from any point of view, whether, from the strictly legal and constitutional side, or on the basis of the Principle of implied authority as suggested by Mr Manzoor Qadir, or even in terms of the so-called legal order purported to be created by the Provisional Constitution Order of 1969 itself, I cannot escape the conclusion that the Presidential Order No, 3 was an unconstitutional document. General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan according to me no authority to pass such legislation taking away the powers of the courts in his capacity as president under the provisional constitution order. The Martial Law introduced by him was illegal and therefore, even as Chief Martial Law Administrator he was not competent to_validly pass _such laws, and it certainly was in excess of the implied authority, if any, given to him by the letter of Field Marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan dated the 24th of March 1969.  The High Courts were, therefore, wrong in thinking that they had no jurisdiction to enquire into this matter.”  "

Normally, the matter would have been ended there but Chief Justice Marshall did not stop there, It was not necessary but he digged further, although, Marbury was only interested in his own commission and not in the least in the vires of the relevant clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789, but Marshall CJ, on examination of the relevant provi- sions found that a contradiction did in fact exist between the Constitution and the pertinent provision of the aforesaid Act.  Robert K Carr tried to visualize the mind-set of a great Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in its infancy in this manner : <br> “In other words, Marshall was invoking that power for the first time at just such a moment when the Fathers probably intended it should be exercised. Jefferson had become  president and his party had won control of Congress. The opposition had obtained com- plete control of the political branches of the government. Is_it_not obvious that_from_the point of view of the Founding Fathers and the Federalist party the time had come to point out that the Constitution as a higher law did place restraints upon congress at the Supreme court as guardian of the constitution had power to enforce those restraints?  In Marbury vs Madison we see Chief Justice Marshall suggesting that the Supreme Court was duty-bound as _a__matter of unescapable__principle to enforce __the constitution as as ol of restraint upon con-                gressional authority through the exercise of its power of Judicial review, ......., * (Quoted from Robert K. Carr on ‘The Supreme Court’ and Judicial Review\" at page-71), (The underlinings are mine)  This is how the review was made two hundred years ago in Marbury vs Madison:  \"If an act of the legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void does it notwithstand- ing its invalidity bind the courts and oblige them to give it effect? or in other words though it be not law does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law?   It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.   The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution.  Could it be the intention of those who gave this power, to say that in using it the constitu- tion should not be looked into? That a case aris- ing under the constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it rises?  This is too extravagant to be maintained. .... Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void: and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by_that_ instrument.” (Quoted from Professor  Noet T. Dowling on the ‘Cases on Constitutional Law Fifth Edition, 1954, at pages-95-97),  "

In ultimate analysis it would appear that it is the people which is the source of power of the Court because ‘We the people of the United States’ dreamt that they would have a Court which would be independent of both Congress and the Executive and cannot be brow-beaten by any. The people believe that inspite of all its short-comings, the Supreme Court is still the most trustworthy and at the same time dispassionate custodian of their nghts and liberties guaranteed under their own Constitution. That is why the famous Presidents like Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, inspite of their visible irritation towards many Rulings of the Supreme Court, dared not curb any of its constitu- tional prerogatives. There lies the real supremacy of the Supreme Court and although ‘scarcely any polit- ical question arises in the United States that is not resolved sooner or later into a judicial question’ (Alexis de Tocqueville, 1848). The Supreme Court neither approves nor condemns any legislative poli- cy, it declares whether the legislation is in accor- dance with or in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution, It is ‘the living voice of the Constitution’ (Bryce).  Now on the question of judicial review.  Chief Justice Coke in Dr Bonham’ Case (1610) went so far as to declare that the Court can even declare an Act of Parliament void.  Chief Justice Coke said : <br> “When an Act of Parliament is against right and reason, OF repugnant, OF impossible to be                performed, the common law will control it and adjudge that Act to be void.\" (Quoted from Lond Denning in ‘What Next In The Law\" page: 319),  His such views was supported by Hobart CJ, another contemporary Chief Justice, He held in Day vs Savage (1614), “... even an Act of Parliament made against natural equity, as to make a man judge in his own cause, is void in itself, for jura natural sunt immutabilia and they are leges legumes.\"(Quoted from Administrative Law by HWR Wade, Fifth Edition, 1982 at page-418).

    "section": "610. Alexander Hamilton in his Federalist 78 (1787-1788) examined the judiciary department of the proposed government thus :  “The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution, I under- stand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attain- der, no ex post facto laws, and the like.  Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of the courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void, Without this, all the reser- vations of particular rights or privileges would amount to NOTHING. ....... No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the constitution can be valid to deny this would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal: that the servant is above his mas!e6 that the representatives of the people are sups rior to the people themselves; that men, acting                by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.  It is far more Rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It must therefore belong to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; in other words, the constitution ought to _be pre- ferred to the statue the intention of the people to the intention their agents. ......... ” ( Quoted from Pater Woll on ‘American Government’, 1962) (The underlinings are mine).(page-265- 266).  It is apparent that the framers of the Constitu- tion envisioned that the Supreme Court shall exer- cise its power of judicial review.  The authority of the Supreme Court, in the lan- guage of Justice Robert H Jackson was, in his pro- posed Godkin lecture at Harvard in 1954, which he could never deliver on the topic ‘The Supreme Court as a Unit of Government’: <br> “What authority does the Court possess which generates this influence? The answer is its power to hold unconstitutional and judicial- ly unenforceable an act of the President of Congress or of a constituent state of the Federation. That power is not expressly granted or hinted at in the Article defining judicial power, but _res on logical implication. It is an incident of jurisdiction to determine what really is the law governing a particular case or contro- versy. In the hierarchy of legal values, if the higher law of the Constitution prohibits what the lower law of the legislative attempts, the latter is a nullity' otherwise, the Constitution would exist only at the option of Congress Thus it comes about that in a private litigation the Court may decide a question of power that will be of great moment to the nation or to a state,” (Quoted from the draft lecture notes of Justice Robert H. Jackson of US Supreme Court, published by Harvard University Press, 1955, at page-22) (The underlinings are mine)  "

We have already found that those Proclamations etc. were issued in complete viola- tion of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, notably, Articles 7, 21, 31 and 142 :  Article 7 : <br> (1) All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution, <br> (2) This Constitution is, as the solem\" expression of the will of the people                the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void. <br> Article 21: <br> (1) Itis the duty of every citizen to observe the Constitution and the laws, to main- tain discipline, to perform public duties and to protect public property. <br> (2) Every person in the service of the Republic has a duty to strive at all times to serve the people. <br> Article 31: <br> To enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being within Bangladesh, and in particular no action detri- mental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law.  But by the Proclamations etc, the Martial Law Authorities, specially Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc, changed the basic feature and structure of the Constitution so much so that secular Bangladesh had been deformed into a theocratic State.  We have already found that the Constitution which is the supreme Jaw of Bangladesh, was made subordinate and subservient to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs, by the Martial Law Authorities, which had no legal basis thereby betrayed and insulted the entire population of Bangladesh with its three million martyrs.  We have also found that Khondaker Moshtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc, had no authority or jurisdiction either to declare Martial Law in Bangladesh or to govern Bangladesh by such Martial Law Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. We have further found that rule by Martial Law is a negation of liberty and independence for which nearly three million Bangalees laid down their lives.  Paragraph 18 to the Fourth Schedule, was thrust into the Constitution by the Fifth Amendment, sought to legalise all those arbitrary and illegal Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. As such, the Court is not only entitled but it is imperative on its part to break open the veil of enactment and to bring those Proclamations etc. to open which the said amendments illegally sought to ratify, confirm and validate and which would certainly ‘shock the sense of fair play’ of any reasonable person.  We have also noticed the last limb of Para -18 to the Fourth Schedule : <br> “18 . All Proclamations -made during the period between the 15th August, 1975, and the 9th April, 1979............ ..................all orders made, acts and things done,.......be called in question in or before any Court tribunal or authority on any ground whatsoever.  This kind of ouster of jurisdiction clause is negation of fair play, and devoid of confidence on the part of the dictators and almost always is employed to shun away from the scrutiny of a Court of law. This is what we term as the breach of the principle of rule of law.  Thus, in enacting the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, a colourable legislation, a fraud was committed upon the people of Bangladesh,  This is the worst case of violation of rule of law known to us, comparable possibly only to the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1986 . As such, we are of the opinion, that the Parliament had no rational basis in enacting the Fifth Amendment, in violation of the various provisions of the Constitution, notably, the Third Paragraph of the Preamble and Articles 7, 21 and 31, and also 142,               <br> Part XXX Role of the Supreme Court and Its Power of Judicial Review <br> We have noticed above that Paragraph 18 to the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution sought to oust the jurisdiction of the Court.  Article 55(2) of the Constitution of Bangladesh vests the executive power of the Republic on the Prime Minister while under Article 65(1), the leg- islative powers are vested on the Parliament which is the House of the Nation. Similarly, Article 94(1) provides for the establishment of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Article 114 provides for the subordi- nate courts.  "

In Bachan Singh vs Punjab AIR 1982 SC 1325, Bhagwati, J expounded the heart of rule of Jaw in this manner at pages 1336-1337 : <br> \"10..... it is clear that the rule of law permeates the entire fabric of the Constitution                and indeed forms one of its basic features. The rule of law excludes arbitrariness; its postulate is ‘intelligence without passion’ and ‘reason freed from desire’. Wherever we find arbitrari- Ness or unreasonableness there is denial of the rule of law. That is why Aristotle preferred a government of laws rather than of men. ‘Law’, in the content of the rule of law, does not mean any law enacted by the legislative authority, howsoever, arbitrary or despotic it may be. Otherwise, even under a dictatorship it would be possible to say that there is rule of law, because every law made by the dictator, howso- ever, arbitrary and unreasonable has to be obeyed and every action has to be taken in con- formity with such law. In. such a case too even where the political set up is dictorical. it is law that governs the relationship between men and men and between me e State. But still it is not rule of law as understood in modern jurisprudence, because in jurisprudential terms the law itself in such a case being an emanation from the absolute will of t dictator it is in effect and substance the rule of man and not of law which prevails in such a situation. What is a necessary element of the rule of law is that the law must not be arbitrary or irrational and it must satisfy the test of reason and the demo- cratic form of policy seeks to ensure this ele- ment by making the framers of the law account-  able to the people. ............ ”  "

AV Dicey in his ‘An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution’, 10th Edition (1959), explained the meaning of the Rule of Law which has profound influence on the thoughts in this branch of discipline in Constitutional Law. Dicey summed up at pages-202-3 : <br><br> “That “rule of law,” then, which forms 4 fundamental principle of the constitution, 2 three meanings, or may be regarded from three different points of view. <br>               It means, in the first place, the absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power, and excludes the existence of arbitrariness, of pre- rogative, or even of wide discretionary authori- ty on the part of the government. Englishmen are ruled by the law, and by the law alone; a man may with us be punished for a breach of law, but he can be punished for nothing else.  It means, again, equality before the law, or the equal subjection of all classes to the ordi- nary law of the land administered by the ordi- nary law courts; the “rule of law” in this sense excludes the idea of any exemption of officials or others from the duty of obedience to the law which governs other citizens or from the juris- diction of the ordinary tribunals; ...........-  The “rule of law,” lastly, may be used as a formula for expressing the fact that with us the law of the constitution, the rules which in for- eign countries naturally form part of a constitu- tional code, are not the source but the conse- quence of the rights of individuals, as defined and enforced by the courts; that, in short, the principles of private law have with us been by the action of the courts and Parliament so extended as to determine the position of the Crown and of its servants; thus the constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land.”  "

It reached the height of prosperity in science, arts, culture, philos- ophy and in all other disciplines. The King was French and so also his subjects. But the despotism of Louis XVI left the people helpless. The writings of Voltaire, Montesquicu, Rousseau, Abbe Raynal, Quesnay, Turgot etc. roused the people to revolution with a battle cry for equality, liberty and fraternity. although as a nation, they were independent. Afier deposing the King, the National Assembly made the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens. Some of the rights as declared were as follows: <br> ‘I, Men are born, and always continue. free, and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility. <br> “II ............................ <br> ‘III. The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, or ANY BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it.  ‘IV.

The exercise of the natural rights of every man, has no other limits than those which are necessary to secure to every other man the free exercise of the same rights; and these limits are deter- minable only by the law.

The law of adverse possession has got no application in case of uncon- stitutional acts and events. One must not loose sight that the Constitution is supreme and every person in the Republic, be he is a servant of the Republic or an ordinary citizen, owe his unquestionable, unquali- fied and absolute loyalty to the Constitution. Any attempt to deface the Constitution or to make it sub- servient tantamounts to the offence of sedition of worst kind. The Fifth Amendment sought to legalise such offences committed by the Martial Law Authorities and the learned the Advocates for the respondents submitted that it cannot be questioned, because those Proclamations etc, were made by the Martial Law Authorities, that the Fifth Amendment itself provided that the ratification, confirmation and the validation of those Proclamations etc. and the actions taken thereon cannot be questioned before any Court, that it is beyond question because no body challenged those in all these years, as such, deemed to be waived or acquiesced. Those argu-                ments are neither legal nor logical, Those arguments would not have been accepted even before the Star Chamber not to speak in the dawn of 21st century.  "

It appears that the legality of either the Martial Law Proclamations or that of the Filth Amendment was not finally decided in the Order summarily rejecting the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994 . Such summary rejection does not debar chal- lenging of those provisions in a subsequently filed Writ petition, on the principle of res judicata, since no such issue had been raised therein or heard and finally decided by the said Court, The sine qua non for application of the principle of res judicata is the finality of a decision in an earlier action, Since no rule was issued in the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994, the summary order passed in the said writ petition in the absence of the respondents therein, do not oper- ate as res judicata in the present Writ petition.  508, Besides, the vires of the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act No. | of 1979), was not under challenge in the Writ Petition No, 802 of 1994, This will also be apparent from the obser- vation of Mustafa Kamal, CJ, in dismissing the Civil Appeal No. 15 of 1997:  \" ............Also, the vires of Act No, 1 of 1979 is not under challenge in this appeal.” <br>                In the present writ petition No. 6016 of 2000, the cause-title reads as follows: \"In the matter of  Paragraph 18 of the Fourth Schedule under Article 150 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh added by the Constitu- tion (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act 1 of 1979) purported to ratify and confirm.

The Court summarily rejected the petition praying for handing over the concemed property in favour of the petitioner-company. But no Rule was issued and no issue could be said to be finally decided in the said writ petition, either in respect of the aforesaid notifi- cation or any of the Martial Law Proclamations etc. and its ratification, confirmation and validation by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979.

This postponement of holding of the National Assembly had serious repercussions all over Pakistan specially in the erstwhile East Pakistan, The Army Rulers of Pakistan unleashed a reign of terror and a genocide on the unarmed people of the erstwhile East Pakistan. Consequently, Indepen- dence of Bangladesh was declared on the March 26. 1971, as a Sovereign Independent Republic.  "

Firstly because the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, whatever its political merits or demerits, it was brought about by the representatives of the people by an overwhelming majority members of a sover- eign Parliament. Secondly, however undemocratic, the Fourth Amendment may appear to an army com- mander, the amendment of the Constitution, could not be made even by the President or the CMLA or  any person, how high so ever, but only by a Parliament. Thirdly, Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc being an usurper to the Office of the President and in the Office of the legally non-exis- tent Chief Martial Law Administrator, had no authority to change the Constitution. As an Officer of the Defence Services, he took oath to protect the Constitution of Bangladesh, but instead, on April 23. 1977, only two days after assuming the office of President, he illegally and without any lawful authority amended the various provisions of the Constitution which were the fundamental basis for the struggle for Liberation, by the Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, and made the secular Republic of Bangladesh, a theocratic State, thereby the cause of the Liberation War of Bangladesh was betrayed.

As such, the Bangalees although retained their entity through their literature and cul- tural heritage but always governed by the people other than Bangalees. That is one of the reasons, Bengal voted so much in favour Muslim League in 1946 election on the Pakistan issue but even after independence from British yoke, in no time, their enthusiasm got a jolt when Mr Jinnah declared at Dhaka in 1948 that Urdu would be the only state- language of Pakistan. This was followed by a long history of conspiracies to cripple the majority East Pakistan economically, politically and also to destroy their cultural heritage and above all their pride the Bangalee Nationalism but instead, with the rise of oppression, Bangali nationalism got new exu- berance. The Pakistani Military Janta instead of sct- tling the issues politically unleashed the worst geno- cide in the history of mankind. One of their prime objectives was to destroy and sweep away our Bangalee nationalism from root, once for all and make the Bangalees a hundred percent Pakistani.

In their lighter moments they laugh as a Bangalee, in their despair they cry as a Bangalee, they record their feelings in Bangla, their history, their philosophy. their culture, their literature are all in Bangla. These finer features of life and intellects gave them an identity as a race in India for more than thousand years. This was so recorded in the memoirs of Hiuen Tsang, Ibn Batuta and many other travellers. Even during the reign of Emperor Akbar, this part of his empire was known as ‘Sube Bangla’. As such, this identity as a Bangalee was not a mere illusion or frivolous idiosyncrasy but has a definite character which separated them from other races in Pakistan. The identity of Punjabees, Pathans etc might have faded away in their new identity as Pakistanees but the Bangalees consciously kept their separate entily in their culture and literature inspite of their                Pakistani citizenship. This was their pride. Their such entity as Bangalee blooms in their weal and woe. This sentiment may not have strict legal value but this very sentiment of Bangalee nationalism paved the way to the ultimate independent Bangla- desh which has a very definite legal existence. As such, nobody, how high so ever, must not ignore or under-value the words ‘Bangla’ or ‘Bangalee’ hecause since 1952, beginning with the martyrs of language movement, thousands of Bangalees gave their lives for their right not only to speak Bangla but also to live as such Bangalee.

According to Thomas Paine, the purpose of the Constitution is : <br> \"A Constitution is not the act of govern- ment, but of a people constituting a _govern- ment, and a government without a constitution is power without right......A constitution is a thing antecedent to a government; and a _gov- ernment is only the creature of a constitution.” (1792) (Quoted from Hilaire Barnett on Consti- tutional And administrative Law, Fourth Edi- tion, 2002, Page-7).  (The underlinings are mune)  According to O Hood Phillips, the purpose of the Constitution is : <br> “The Constitution of a State in the abstract sense is the system of laws, customs and con- ventions which define the composition and powers of organs of the state, and regulate the relations of the various state organs to one another and to the private citizen. A “Constitution” in the concrete sense is the doc- ument in which the most important laws of the                 constitution are authoritatively ordained.\" (Quoted from O. Hood Phillips’ Constitutional and Administrative Law, Seventh Edition, 1987, at page-5). (The underlinings are mine)  From the discussions made above on the con- cept of written Constitution it would appear that this instrument is predominantly for the purpose of reg- ulating the rights and obligations of the people vis- d-vis the State and vice versa but it has got nothing to do with the religious beliefs of its people.

A Constitution upholds and guarantees such dignity to the people of the Republic with its own rights and also its obligations to the Republic in a broader sense but the religion of a particular section or sec- tions of people shall neither required to be high- lighted nor be interfered with in an ideal and model democratic form of Republic. The Constitution of such a Republic would never contain or refer to a particular faith but would leave such faculties with the people themselves. Bangladesh was dreamt of as a secular country and came into being as a secular country, as such, its Constitution was framed on that ideal, but any change from such a basis would con- stitute a change of the basic structure of the Constitution.

Before we conclude our discussions on the supremacy of the Constitution we would like to quote from the treatise; ‘American Jurisprudence’ second Edition (1998) Vol 16 published by West Group, USA at pages: 344 to 349: <br> “1 . Definition and nature of “constitu- tion” and “constitutional law,” generally <br> 5 . Generally The United States is a constitutional democracy. The constitutional form of govern- ment as it exists in the United States is based on the fundamental conception of a supreme law, expressed in written form,’ in accordance with which all private rights must be determined and all public authority administered.  Constitutional government by the people represents the greatest and grandest struggles of humanity for its betterment, and in its accom- plishment marks the uttermost political accom- plishment of the human race, The limitations imposed by the American system of constitu- tional law on the action of the governments, both state and national, are deemed to be essen- tial to the preservation of public and private rights, notwithstanding the representative char- acter of our political institutions. In the United States, the right of sovereignty is vested in the people and is exercised through the joint action of the federal and state governments.  From the above rather lengthy discussions it is firmly and undeniably established that: <br> (i) The Constitution is the supreme law in Bangladesh; (ii)All great Institutions of the Republic, namely the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary are the creations of the Constitution; <br> (iii) All functionaries of the Republic are the the creatures of the Constitution; <br> (iv)The services of the Republic including the defence services are the creatures of the Constitution; <br> (v) As such, all the Institutions, functionaries and the services of the Republic, owe its existence to the Constitution and whol- ly and fully bound by its edicts.  <br> (vi)The existence of the country as a Republic is dependent on its Constitution.

He observed: <br> “In such a case we would hardly call the Government Constitutional Government. The real justification of Constitutions, the original idea behind them is that of limiting Government and of requiring those who govern to conform to the law and usage. Most Constitutions as we have been seen do purport to limit the Gvernment “and_if_in turn a constitution imposes restriction upon the powers of the insti- tution it must _be said” then the courts must decide whether _their actions transgress those restrictions and in doing so, the Judge must say what the Constitution means.”  Professor Wheare was quoted further;  “The substance of the matter is that while it is the duty of every institution established under the authority of a Constitution and exercising powers granted by Constitution, to keep within the limits of those words, it is the duty of the Court from the nature of their function to say what these limits are? and that is why courts come to interpret a Constitution”.

Similar question had also been faced by Hamoodur Rahman, CJ in the case of Asma Jilani vs                Government of Punjab PLD 1972 SC 139, This is how his Lordship dealt with the problem at page- 202-03 : <br> “The learned Attomey-General however, insists that even this regime had received the legal recognition of this Court and, therefore, It had also acquired de jure authority to make laws. Reference in this connection has been made to two decisions, The first was in the case of Muhammad Ismail vs State (1) in which the judgment was delivered again by myself. The only question raised in this case was as to whether after the promulgation of Martial Law on the 25th of March 1969, and the enactment of the Provisional Constitution Order on the 4th of April 1969, this Court continued to retain the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Constitu- tion of 1962 to entertain petitions for special leave to appeal in criminal proceedings in view of the fact that the Provisional Constitution Order did not specifically provide for any appeal by special leave. No question was raised in this case as to the validity of the Martial Law or of the Provisional Constitution Order. The only question argued was whether on a proper construction of the language of this order an appeal for special leave in criminal proceedings was still within the competence of this Court. The Court held that upon a proper construction of the terms of the Order the Jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals by special leave in criminal matters had not been taken away and that the jurisdiction given to it by Article 58 of the 1962-Constitution remained unaffected. There was no question, therefore, of any con- scious application of the mind of the Court to the question of the validity of the regime or the legality of the Provisional Constitution Order nor was this Court called upon to give any deci- sion thereon as the latter order had manifested no intention to alter that jurisdiction and there was no conflict between the two. It is not cor- rect, therefore, to say that this decision in any way constitutes a conscious recognition in law of the new regime. The next case referred to is that of Mian Fazal Ahmad vs State (2). In this case, which was a petition for special leave from an order of the Lahore High Court dismissing an applica- tion under section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashment of certain criminal proceedings pending investigation by the police;_the High Court had admitted the any challan in any Court. The police did not do so but instead of submitting a challan before a Criminal Court placed the matter before a Military Court and the latter convicted the peti- tioner. Thereupon the petitioner moved the High Court, for taking action against the DSP in contempt for disobedience of its order. The High Court dismissed the application of the petitioner and this Court by a very brief order dismissed the petition for special leave observ- _ ing that “when the Military Court took cog- nizance of the offence and imposed a penalty on the petitioner learned Judge in the High Court was right in dismissing the petitioner’s applica- tion under section 56l-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure” No other reason was given for the order.  Again, this does not show that the legality of the order of transfer of the case to the Military Court was over challenged, The High Court’s order was upheld possibly on the ground that the proceedings which were sought to be quashed by the original petition having . been terminated by the transfer of the case to the Military Court, there was no further need of its quashment, and no question of commitment of the DSP in contempt arose, as he had not vio- lated the order of the High Court. In these cir- cumstances, it can hardly be urged that this con- stitutes a conscious legal recognition of the mil- itary regime of 1969 . Questions in dispute in these cases were it entirely different and had nothing whatever to do with the question now before us. It is incorrect, therefore, to say that this Court had given any legal recognition to the                regime of General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan,  The question, therefore, is still at large and has for the first time now been raised before this Court in this specific form. The learned Attorney-General's contention that even the tacit approval given by this Court by not ques tioning suo motu the various Martial Law Regulations made by the regime concemed dur- ing this period of 2 1/2 years is it self sufficient to preclude this Court from going into this ques- tion now, is not in my opinion, tenable. The Courts, as I have already indicated are not called upon to suo motu raise a controversy and then decide it, They can only do so if a litigant  raises the controversy in a concrete form, as it has now been done before us. “The Court”, says Mr Eaton Drome, “has authority to expound the Constitution only in cases presented to it for adjudication. Its Judges may see the President usurping powers that do not belong him, Congress exercising functions it is forbidden to exercise, a State asserting rights denied to it. The Court has no authority to interfere until its office is invoked in a case submitted to it in the manner prescribed by law.” (Vide Marriot English Political Institutions, 1938 Edn, P, 293).  We have seen from the opinions of our Apex Court given in the cases of Halima Khatun, Haji Joynal Abedin, Kh. Ehteshamuddin, Nasiruddin and Anwar Hossain Chowdhury that the Martial Law Proclamations etc, made the Constitution a bunch of worthless sheaf of papers.  "

After considering the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and also the Constitution including Article 7, Fazle Munim, J (as his Lordship then was), observed at para-18 : <br> \" ....................... what appears from the Proclamation of August 20, 1975 is that with the declaration of Martial Law in Bangladesh on August 15, 1975, Mr Khondker Moshtaque Ahmed who became the President of Bangladesh assumed full powers of the                 Government and by Clause (d) and (e) of the Proclamation made the Constitution of Bangladesh, which was allowed to remain in force, subordinate to the Proclamation and any Regulation or order as may be made by the President in pursuance thereof. In Clause (h) the power to amend the Proclamation was pro- vided. It may be true that whenever there would be any conflict between the Constitution and the Proclamation or a Regulation or an Order the intention, as appears from the language employed, does not seem to concede such supe- riority to the Constitution. Under the Proclama- tion which contains the aforesaid clauses the Constitution has lost its character as the Supreme law of the country. There is no doubt, an express declaration in Article 7(2)of the Constitution to the following effect : “This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void.” Ironically enough, this Article, though still exists, must be taken to have lost some of its importance and efficacy. In view of clauses (d), (e) and (g) of the Proclamation the supremacy of the  Constitution as declared in that Article, no longer unqualified. In spite of this Article, no Constitutional provision can claim to be sacro- sanct and immutable. The present Constitutional provision may however, claim superiority to any law other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation.”  However unpalatable it may appear to us Fazle Munim, J, very crudely narrated that the Consti- tution of Bangladesh was made subservient and sub- ordinate to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs.

In highlighting the basic structure doctrine SB Majumder, J., observed at para - 32: <br> \"'32.It is true, as submitted by leaned  Senior Counsel, Shri Dwivedi for the appellant  State that under Article 16(4) the State is  enabled to provide for reservations in services.  But so far as “Judicial Service™ is concerned, the Governor,  such reservation can be made by in exercise of his rule-making power only after  consultation with the High Court But so long as it is not done, the Legislature cannot,  by an indirect method, completely by passing the High Court and exercising its legislative power, circumvent and cut across the very scheme of recruitment and appointment to the District Judiciary as envisaged by the makers of the Constitution. Such an exercise, apart from being totally forbidden by the constitutional  scheme, will also fall foul on the concept relat- ing to “separation Of powers between the   Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary” as well as the fundamenta| concept of an “inde- pendent Judiciary™ Both these concepts are now elevated to the level of basic structure of the Constitution and are the very heart of the  constitutional scheme”(Page - 683 - 4).

This is a  rigid or controlled and an organic  _ instrument. <br> (ii) “The pith and substance of a legislation’ s crucial. It is for the Court to probe  whether it is legal or invalid and ‘the Court must not decline to open its €yes to the truth’. <br>  (iii) The Constitution clothes the Parliament with the general power to legislate on  any matter but this is subject to the fun- damental limitations formulated in the  Constitution and the specific procedure stipulated therein.                             (iv) The President or any body else has got no power to amend the Constitution. <br> (v) Parliament may amend a provision of the Constitution following the neces- sary procedure but can neither abrogate it nor suspend it or change its basic fea-  ture or structure. <br> (vi)  The power to destroy is not a power to amend. <br> (vii) The ‘law’ in Article 7 is conclusively d to include an amending law. An amending law becomes part of the Constitution but an amendment, cannot be valid if it is inconsistent with the  Constitution. <br> (viii) Article 142 merely  confers the enabling power for amendment but cannot swal- low the constitutional fabrics. <br>  (ix) The fabrics of the Constitution cannot be dismantled even by the Parliament which is a creation of the Constitution  itself.   <br>     (x) The amendments of the Constitution  must be tested against Article 7 since such power of the Parliament is given by the Constitution itself, as such, must reside  within the ambit of the Constitution and itself not beyond it.  (xi) The power to amend under Article 142   is wide but is not that wide to abrogate the Constitution or to transform its democratic republican character into one of dictatorship or monarchy or 10 legalise illegalities.  (xii) Sovereignty of the people, supremacy of the Constitution, Rule of Law, Democracy, Republican form of Government, Unitary State, Separation of powers, Independence of the judiciary. Fundamental Rights, Secularism, aré the basic structures of the Constitution.  (xiii) The Court has got power to undo an amendment if it transgresses its limit and alters a basic structure of the Constitution, If an Act of Parliament conflicts with the Constitution, it has the duty to say that the Act is not law.

With regard to the amending power of the parliament, Badrul Haider Chowdhury, J (as his Lordship then was), held at para — 165-166: <br> 165.The Attorney-General argued that the amending power is a constituent power. It is not a legislative power and therefore, the Parliament has unlimited power to amend the Constitution invoking its constituent power.  166.The argument is untenable. The Attorney-General argued this point keeping an eye on Article 368 of the Constitution of India which says that “Parliament may in exercise of its constituent power amend” etc. which was inserted by amendment following certain obser- vations in the Golak Nath case. The amendment therefore recognised the distinction between an ordinary law and 2 constitutional amendment. It will not be proper to express any opinion as to the merit of any constitutional amendment made in Constitution of another country. It will be enough that our Constitution does not make  such distinction. Secondly, our Constitution is not only a controlled one but the limitation on legislative capacity of the Parliament is  enshrined in such a way that a removal of any plank will bring down the structure itself , For  this reason, the Preamble, Article 8, had been  made unamendable—it has to be referred to the  people! At once Article 7 stares on the face to say: “All power in the Republic_belongs to the people , and more, \"their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under and by the authority of this Constitution\" To dispel any doubt it says: \"This Constitution is as the solemn expression of the will of the people\" The  Preamble says ‘it is our sacred duty t0 safe-  guard, protect, and defend this Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh”.  If Article 26 and Article 7  are read together the position will be clear. The exclusiduary provision of the kind incorporated in Article 26 by amendment has not been incor- porated in Article 7 . That shows that the ‘law’  in Article 7 is conclusively intended to include an_amending law. An amending law becomes part of the Constitution but an amending law cannot_be valid if it is inconsistent with the Constitution, The contention of the Attorney- General on the non-obstante clause in Article  142 is bereft of any substance ‘because that clause merely confers enabling power for  amendment but by interpretative decision that clause cannot be given the status for swallow-  ing_up_the constitutional fabric. It may be noticed that unlike 1956 Constitution or Sree  Lanka Constitution there is no provision in our Constitution for replacing the Constitution.”                 "

If the meaning is the same, Article 368 can only be amended so as not to change its identity completely. Parliament, for instance, could not make the Constitution uncontrolled by changing the pre- scribed two thirds majority to simple majority. Similarly it cannot get rid of the true meaning of the expression “Amendment of the Constitution™ so as to derive power to abrogate fundamental rights.” <br> “410....... . Under__Article 368 Parliament can amend every article of the Constitution as long as the result is within the  imits already laid down by me.

It was the common understanding that fundamental rights would remain in substance as they are and they would not be amended out of existence. It seems also to have been a com- mon understanding that the fundamental <b> fea- tures of the Constitution, manely, secularism, democracy and the freedom of the individual would always subsist in the welfare state. </b>  294 .

Applied to fundamental rights, it would mean that while fundamental rights can- not be abrogated reasonable abridgments of fundamental rights can be effected in the public  interest.                           298, It is of course for Parliament to decide whether an amendment is necessary.

In over-ruling the earlier decisions in Shankari Prasad’s and Sajjan Singh’s case, the majority of the Court reached the following conclu-  sion at para = 53: <br> \"(53) The aforesaid discussion leads to the  following results: <br> (1) The power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution is derived from Arts. 254, 246 and 248 of the Constitution and not from Art. 368 thereof, which only deals with procedure. Amendment is a legislative process. <br> (2) Amendment is ‘law’ within the mean- ing of Art. 13 of the Constitution and, therefore, if it takes away or abridges the rights conferred by part 111 thereof, it is void. <br> (3) The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, and the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, abridge the scope of the fundamental rights. But, on the basis of ear- lier decisions of this Court, they were valid. <br> (4) On the application of the doctrine of ‘prospective overruling’, as explained by us earlier, our decision will have only prospective operation and, therefore, the said amendments will continue to be valid. <br> (5) We declare that the Parliament wij] have no power from the date of this decision to amend any of the provisions of part I of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights enshrined therein. <br> (6) As the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act holds the field, the validity of                the two impugned Acts, namely, The Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act X of 1953, and the Mysore Land Reforms Act X of 1962, as amended by Act X1V of 1965, cannot be ques- tioned on the ground that they offend Arts, 13, 14 or 31 of the Constitution,”  "

On consideration of the relevant provi-      sions, his Lordship held at page-709-712:   <br>   “Narrow constructions were placed by   colonial judges upon the instruments creating   constitutions in colonial Legislatures. Causes of   friction multiplied, and soon 4 conflict   emerged, analogous to that which is the subject   of discussion to-day, between those who insist-   ed that the constitutions conceded to the   colonies could be modified as easily as any      other Act of Parliament, and those who affirmed   that the statute defining such constitutions was                      “fundamental” or ‘organic“and that therefore,   the_constitution_was_controlled, .......We      observe, therefore, the Legislature in this isolat-   ed section carefully selecting one special and      individual & case in_which_limitations_are   imposed upon the power of the Parliamant of    Queensland to express and carry out its purpose   in the ordinary way, by a bare majority\"      His Lordship concluded at page -714;   <br>   “The Legislature of Queensland is the mas-   ter of its own house hold, except in so far as its   powers have in special cases been restricted. No   such restriction has been established, and none   in fact exists, in such a case as is raised in the   issues now under appeal. It follows, therefore,   that s. 6 of the Industrial Arbitration Act, 1916,   was not ultra vires. The Legislature was fully   entitled to vary the tenure of the judicial office.”   <br>   The importance of Mc Cawley’s case is   that the Privy Council recognized that special   procedure for amendment of the Constitution   Act, 1867, may be made and unless such special   procedure’s are prescribed, amendment of a   provision of the Act may be made in the same   way as any other legislation. This brings fore   the theory of the distinction between the flexi-   ble and the rigid Constitution in actual practice.   <br>   Next we shall consider the case of   Attorney-General for New South Wales vs   Trethowan 1932 AC 526 . In the said case, the   Constitution Act, 1902 of New South Wales,      \" was amended by the Act of 1929, adding sec-      tion 7A. The said provision provided that no bill   to abolish that Legislative Council or repealing   section 7A, should be presented for Royal   Assent until approved by the electors in accor-   dance with that section. But in 1930, without   complying with the requirements of section 7A,   two bills were passed one repealing section 7A   and the other abolishing the Legislative council.   The question arose whether the Parliament of   New South Wales has power to abolish the   Legislative Council of the State, or to alter its      constitution or powers, or to repeal section 7A   of the Constitution Act, 1902, except in the   manner provided by the said section 7A. Lord   Sankey LC, found at page -539-41:   <br>   ............. The question then arises,   could that Bill , a repealing Bill after its passage   through both chambers, be lawfully presented   for the Royal assent_ without having first   received the approval of the electors in the pre-   scribed_manner? In their Lordships’ opinion,      the Bill could not lawfully be so presented. The   proviso in the second sentence of s.5 of the Act   of 1865 states a condition which must be _ful-   filled before the legislature can validly exercise   its power to make the kind of laws which are   referred to in that sentence. In order thats. 7A   may be repealed (in other words, in order that   particular law \"respecting the constitution   powers and procedure” of the “legislature   may be validly made) the law for that purpose      must have bee in the manner required   by s. 7A, a colonial law for the time being in   force in New South Wales.”      Then his Lordship held at page -541:   <br>   “In the result, their Lordships are of opin-   ion that s. 7A of the Constitution Act, 1902, was   valid and was in force when the two Bills under   consideration were passed through the Legis-   lative Council and the Legislative Assembly.      Therefore these Bills could not be presented to   the Governor for His Majesty’s_assent_unless   and_until_a majority of the electors voting had         "

In this case, the appointment of Mc   Cawley as a Judge of the Queensland Supreme   Court, under section 6 of the Industrial Arbitration   Act, 1916, passed by Queensland Parliament, was      challenged on the ground that the said provision was   contrary to sections 15 and 16 of the Constitution   Act, 1867 .

Although as a matter of fact, the   people never frames a Constitution but the   Constitution must, of necessity, reflects their ideals,   their hopes their aspirations in general, otherwise, it   will not come from the people, rather it would tan-   tamount to imposing upon them, necessitating   enactment and adoption of one Constitution after   another. In the language of K.C. Wheare in the   ‘Modern Constitutions’ at page - 67:   <br>   “CONSTITUTIONS, when they are   framed and adopted, tend to reflect the domi-   nant beliefs and interests, or some compromise   between conflicting beliefs and interests, which   are characteristic of the society at that time.   Moreover, they do not necessarily reflect polit-   ical or legal beliefs and interests only, They   may embody conclusions or compromises upon   economic and social matters which the framers   of the Constitution have wished to guarantee or      to proclaim. A Constitution is indeed the result-   ant of a parallelogram of forces political, eco-   nomic and social-which operate at the time of   its adoption” <br>      As such, when a Constitution is framed it com-   mands veneration and highest respect from all   because, il is the supreme law of the land and the   Government and all other Institutions are subordi-   nate to the Constitution. The people in that view of   the matter regards their Constitution as their guaran-   tee of their own rights, duties and obligations   towards the state and vice versa, as such, they would   regard it as their own Constitution. Generally the   people would not like any unilateral lighthearted   attempt to change the Constitution, rather, would   like to preserve it against all odds even against a   usurper.      "

Earlier   even after the Fourth Amendment, no fund would      have been available to the President without having   the budget passed by the Parliament. But Article   92A unilaterally authorized the President to with-   draw money from the Consolidated Fund for a peri-   od of 120 days even without the approval of the   Parliament so that the President after dissolving a   dissident Parliament might elect a new Parliament.   Even James | or Charles I in early 17th Century did   not have such power in violation of the provisions of   Magna Carta. Lieutenant-General Oliver Cromwell   even purged the Parliament but could not get the   badly needed funds from the Commons for his army.      "
