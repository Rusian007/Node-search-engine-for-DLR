      "  Sections 120A/34        There is no substantial difference between    conspiracy as defined in section 120A and acting    on a-common intention in section 34. In the for-    mer the gist for the offence is bare agreement and    association to break law even though illegal act    does not follow while the gist of an offence under    section 34 is the commission of a criminal act in    furtherance of a common intention of all the    offenders which means that there should be a    unity of criminal behaviour resulting in    something for which an individual will be    punishable if it is done by himself alone. (Per Md    TafazzulIslamJ).. acs (261)    ",
      "  Section 120B        A conspiracy is a matter of inference    deduced from certain criminal acts of the parties    accused done in pursuance of apparent criminal    purpose common between them. A criminal cons-    piracy consists not merely intention of two or    more, but in the agreement of two or more to do    an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful    means. When two agree to carry it into effect the    very plot of the act itself, and the act of each of    the parties capable of being enforced, if lawful,    possible if for a criminal object or for the use of        criminal means. (Per SK Sinha J). wwe ef 594)    ",
      "      Section 120 B        Conspiracy—In order to constitute the    offence of conspiracy, there must first be a com-    bining together of two or more persons in the    conspiracy; secondly, an act or illegal omission    must take place in pursuance of that conspiracy    in order to the doing of that thing. It is not    necessary that the abettor should concert the        Masor Baziun Hupa vs STATE          offence with the person who commits it. It is Suf.        ficient if he engages in the conspiracy in    pursuance of which the offence is committeg,    Therefore, 1 find that each conspirator plays his    separate part in one integrated and united effory    to achieve the common purpose.

      "      Sections 378 & 429    Hearing of the case by a Third Judge—        The language used in sections 378 and 429 of the    Code is almost identical. It is said that in hearing    a reference or an appeal if the Judges are equally    divided in opinion thereon, the case with their    opinions shall be laid before a third Judge for    hearing, and the third Judge after hearing ‘as he    thinks fit? would deliver his opinion, and the    judgment and order would follow such opinion.    The expressions “as he thinks fit” used in both    the sections are significant. It is the third Judge    to decide on what points or in respect of whom he              shall hear arguments, This postulates that the    third Judge is completely free in resolving the    difference as he thinks fit. If he does not think to    near the arguments in respect of any accused of    whom the Judges are not divided in their    opinions, he may decline to do so. The use of the    words “equally divided” in both the sections    means the Judges differ in their opinions, in    respect of complicity of an accused or on the    charge framed against him or them or on any    particular point it can be inferred that they are    equally divided but in a case where the Judges    concur each other in respect of a particular    accused and in respect of the offence charged, it    can not be said that Judges are equally divided in    respect of the accused charged with.        One view is that the Third Judge is required to    examine the whole case independently and that he is not    bound by the two opinions of the two Judges comprising    the Division Bench even if there is no difference in respect    of any one of the accused persons. The other view is that    it is the discretion of the Third Judge to decide on what    points he shall hear the arguments, if any, and he is    completely free in resolving the difference.

      "    Section 31(a)(b)(c) and (d)        Clause (a) of section 31 of the Army Act rela-    tes to the substantive offence of mutiny and in-    subordination, while other three sub-clauses (b),    (c) and (d) relate to the abetment of the offence of    mutiny. In order to bring an offence of mutiny    within the ambit of the Act, there must be        MaJor BazLut Hupa vs STATE 3        evidence of overthrowing or resisting lawful    authority of the armed forces or disobeying the    authority in such circumstances as to make the    disobedience subversive of discipline or to    impede the performance of any duty or service in    the armed forces of Bangladesh. There is nothing    on record to show that the appellants and other    accused have collectively insubordinated or    defied or disregarded the authority in the armed    forces or refused to obey authority in order to    bring their act within the ambit of mutiny or    abetment for mutiny. (Per SK Sinha J).      ",
      "    Section 8(2)        Plea of ‘mutiny’—Since the prosecution wit-    nesses did not say anything in support of the plea    of mutiny, the defence ought to have made out a    case at least by way of suggestion to the witnesses    that the army officers involved in the mutiny    submitted their charter of demands to the    authority in the armed forces and that as their        .demands were not redressed, they revolted.        Secondly, if there was rebellion as claimed the        rebellious force would have attacked their com-        manding officer, and if the commanding officer    was involved, they would have attacked the Chief    of army staff but they did not attack them, rather    killed the President which proved that it was not    a mutiny. (Per SK Sinha J)  <br>      Rule of Law—The concept of rule of law is    recognised all over the world, and our founding    fathers of the Constitution also adopted that    principle, but we failed to apply the same in the        case of the killing of our Father of the Nation.

      "382. In the case of State vs Tajul Islam repon-    ed in 48 DLR 305, commenting on section 34 of the    Penal Code Md Badruzzaman, J observed as under:      <br>  “Section 34 does not create any distinct    offence. This section is intended to meet a case    where members of a party acted in furtherance    of the common intention of all but it was diffi-    cult to prove exactly the part played by each of    them, It means that if two or more persons    intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the    same as if each of them had done it individual-    ly, Common intention within the meaning of    this section presupposes a prior concert. There    must be prior meeting of minds to form pre    arranged plan to commit an offence. A common    intention with meeting of minds to commit a\"    offence in furtherance of the common intention    invites the application of section 34 of the Penal    Code. In offences involving physical violenc*    normally presence at the scene of the offence °    the offender sought to be rendered liable on tH    Principle of joint liability is necessary but such  is not the case in respect of other offences  where offence consists of diverse acts which  may be done at different time and place,”    ",
      "381. In the instant case it has been submitted    on behalf of the appellants Lieutenant Colonel Syed    Farugue Rahman (Lancer), Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant    Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (2nd Artillery) were not    physically present in the house of the then President    at Road No.32, Dhanmondi during the occurrence    between 4-30 to 5-30 in the early moming of 15th    August, 1975 . In this context it would be pertinent    to consider the case of Tukaram Ganpat Pandare vs    State of Maharashtra reported in AIR 1974 SC 5] 4,    where some articles were stolen from the godown        and carried away by a lorry which stopped at a    weigh bridge. There was no evidence about the pres-    ence of the appellants at the scene of offence but he    was found in possession of a duplicate key of the        burgled godown and he was    Hs present at the Weigt    Uridge. R Krishna Lyer, J held— -    <br>    “Mere distance from the scene of cr;    bed        cannot exclude culpability under sectio, :    which lays down the rule of joint Tesponsibjt:,    for a criminal act performed by a plurality 2    persons, In Barandra Kumar Ghosh ys Kin    Emperor, (1924) 52 IA 40 = AIR 1925 Pc | ‘    Judicial Committee drew into the crimina| fe    those ‘who only stand and wait.’ This doe; not    mean that some form of presence, near ,,    remote, is not necessary, or that mere Presence    without more, at the spot of crime, spells culpa    bility. Criminal sharing, overt or covert, by    active presence or by distant direction, makin,    out a certain measure of jointness in the com,    mission of the act is the essence of section 34    The act here is not the picking the godown lock    but house-breaking and criminal house trespas;,    This crime is participated in by those operating    by remote control as by those doing physical    removal. Together operating in concert, the    criminal project is executed. Those who supply    the duplicate key, wait at the weigh bridge for    the bread-in and bringing of the booty and later    secrete the keys are participes criminis.”    [emphasis added]        ",
      "380. Inthe case of Rasod Bux vs State report-    ed in 22 DLR (SC) 297, one of the accuseds fired his    gun towards the victim but the appellant fired two    shots in the air. It was contended that the. appellant    had no intention to commit any murder. The judg-    ment and order of conviction and sentence was    affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. While    passing judgment Hamoodur Rahman, J observed in    the following manner:    “There is‘no doubt that to bring a case    within the ambit of section 34, PPC, it is neces-    sary that some overt act .or acts must be established                      to Jead to the inference that the participa-    tors in the crime acted in pre-concert oF under    some pre-arranged plan but this does not ee    that every participant in the crime must be    shown to have committed the same kind of act.    It is sufficient to show that they joined together    in the commission of a particular act, for then    they must all be deemed to have intended the    natural and inevitable consequences of that act    even if some of them did nothing but merely    helped by their presence the commission of the    act.”    <br>    In the case of Tunu vs State of Orissa reported    in 1988 CriLJ 524, BK Behera, J held—    <br>    “Common intention is to be gathered from        the acts and conduct of the accused persons pre-    ceding, attending and succeeding the occur-    rence. No doubt, the petitioner, who had stood    on the road and blocked it had not participated    in the actual assault, but his conduct in blocking    the road and forcing PW 14 to stop the car and    thereby facilitating the other two persons to    attack PW 14 would undoubtedly show that he    had shared the common intention with the other    two petitioners to attack and assault PW 14 . It is    not necessary that to attract section 34 of the    Code, every person must have assaulted and    caused hurt.” i        ",
      "379. Section 34 of the Penal Code being a rule    of evidence and not a substantive offence, it is com-    mitted when two or more persons intentionally    commit a criminal act jointly in furtherance of a    common intention of all. Common intention pre-    supposes a prior concert or pre-arranged plan    between the persons participating to commit an    offence. Common intention under section 34 can be    established as an inference from the fact of partici-    pation in the commission of the offence.        ",
      "378. Matters relating to section 34 of the    Penal Code, 1860= Acts done by several persons in    furtherance of common intention.        It has been asserted by Mr Khan Saifur Rahman    and Mr Abdur Razaque Khan that accused    Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman (Lancer),    Licutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan    and Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Artillery) having not been present at the time of    killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman    and his family members, they cannot be convicted    under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code    because they were not physically present at the    place of occurrence. In this context, it appears that    the accused appellants were separately deployed in    different places, according to their pre-plans and    pre-design in furtherance of the common intention    of all the accused persons, those who were physical-    ly present and those who were not present at House    No. 677, Road No.32, Dhanmondi but the deploy-    ment was done as per their pre-plan‘at various places    in furtherance of their common intention and, as    such, they are also equally guilty of the offences    under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code.        ",
      "377. In view of the aforesaid decisions we are        of the view that even if the acts of the accused have    gone beyond the stage of conspiracy and the sub-    stantive offence is committed in pursuance thereof,    both the specific charges of substantive offence    along with the charge of conspiracy can be simulta-    neously maintained, inasmuch as either conspiracy    or a substantive offence or both may be proven on    the same fact. Just because a conspiracy is culmi-    nated into a substantive criminal offence does not    render the act of conspiracy a separate and distinct    offence, vitiated or nullified. The act of conspiracy,    having once been committed, crystallises into an    offence under section 120B of the Penal Code,    Which continues to be a criminal offence, notwith-    Standing the subsequent events, if any. Offence    under section 120B, Penal Code is generally co-    extensive with any substantive offence committed    Subsequently. Accordingly, in the instant case,    charge under section 302 and section 120B of the    Penal Code was rightly maintained against the    accused appellants in all the appeals.            ",
      "376. Having considered the decision in the    case of Leo Roy Frey vs Superintendent, District    Jail Amiritsar reported in AJR 1958 SC 119, SR    Das.C.J. explained the offence of conspiracy vis-a-    yjs the substantive offence in the following terms:        “The offence of a conspiracy to commit a    crime is a different offence from the crime that    is the object of the conspiracy because the con-    spiracy precedes the commission of the crime    and is complete before the crime is attempted or    completed, equally the crime attempted or com-    pleted does not require the element of conspira-        cy as one of its ingredients. They are, therefore,    quite separate offences.”        ",
      "375. ‘In the case of State vs Nalini (1999) ;        SCC 253, Quadri, J held that it is not necessary \"    all the conspirators should participate from t                      inception to the end of the conspiracy; some may    ! : the conspiracy after the time when such inten-    os was first entertained by any one of them and        ye others may quit from the conspiracy. All of    0\" m cannot but be treated as conspirators. Where in    guance of the agreement the conspirators commit        ences individually or adopt illegal means to do a    iecall act which has a nexus to the object of conspir-    cyvall of them will be liable for such offences even    a come of them have not actively participated in the    vomnmission of those offences. . femphasis added]        ",
      "374. In the case of Suresh Chandra Bahri vs Sate of Bihar reported in AIR 1994 SC 2420, while confronted with contention that there is no direct illegal evidence against the appellants for their involvement in conspiracy.     “Where the conspiracy alleged is with    regard to commission of a serious crime of the    nature as contemplated in section 120B reaq        with the proviso to sub-section (2) of section        120A of the IPC then in that event mere proof    of an agreement between the accused for com-    mission of such a crime alone is enough to    bring about a conviction under section 120B        _ and the proof of any overt act by the accused or    by-any one of them would not be necessary. The    provisions in such a situation do not require that    each and every person who is a party to the con-        spiracy must do some overt act towards the ful-    filment of the object of conspiracy, the essential    ingredient being an agreement between the con-    spirators to commit the crime and if these    requirements and ingredients are established    the act would fall within the trapping of the pro-    visions as contained in section 120B since from    its very nature a conspiracy must be conceived    and hatched in complete secrecy, because other-    wise the whole purpose may be frustrated and it    is common experience and goes without saying    that only in very rare cases one may come    across direct evidence of a criminal conspiracy    '0 commit any crime and in most-of the cases !    is only circumstantial evidence which is avail    able from which an inference giving rise to the    conclusion of an agreement between two °    more persons to commit an offence may    legitimately drawn,” [emphasis added,        ",
      "373. In the case of Kehar Singh vs State        (Delhi Admn) reported in AJR 1980 SC 1983,    K Jagannatha Shetty, J observed as follows:    <br>    “Generally, a conspiracy is hatched in    Secrecy and it may be difficult to adduce direct    evidence of the same. The prosecution will    often rely on evidence of acts of various parties    to infer that they were done in reference to their    common intention. The prosecution will also    more often rely upon circumstantial evidence.    The conspiracy can be undoubtedly proved by    such evidence direct or circumstantial. But the    Court must enquire whether the two persons are    independently pursuing the same end or they    have come together to the pursuit of the unlaw-    ful object. The former does not render them    conspirators, but the latter does. It is, however    essential that the offence of conspiracy required    some kind of physical manifestation of agreement.

      "372. In the case of Sanjaya Gandhi vs State    (Delhi Admn) reported in AIR 1980 SC 1382 the    Supreme Court of India observed—        pre it is well settled that in order to    prove a criminal conspiracy which is punish-    able wander section 120B of the Indian Penal    Code, there must be direct or circumstantial    evidence to show that there was an agreement    between two or more persons to commit an    offence. This clearly envisages that there must    be 2 meeting of minds resulting in an ultimate    decision taken by the conspirators regarding the    commission of an offence. It-is true that in most    cases it will be difficult to get direct evidence of    an agreement 10 conspire but a conspiracy can    be inferred even from circumstances giving rise    to 2 conclusive or irresistible inference of an    agreement belween two or more persons to    commu! an offence.”        ",
      "374. In the case of Suresh Chandra Bahyj 7\"    State of Bihar reported in AIR 1994 SC 2429, While    confronted with the contention that there is no direc    illegal evidence against the appellants for their    involvement in conspiracy, the Supreme Cour of    India observed:        ",
      "371. Sardar Sardul Singh Caveeshar vs State    of Maharashtra reported in AIR 1965 SC 682 the    Supreme Court of India held:        <br>        “The essence of conspiracy is, therefore,    that there should be an agreement between per-    sons to do one or other of the acts described in    the section, The said agreement may be proved    by direct evidence or may be inferred from acts    and conduct of the parties.”        ",
      "370. In the earlier case of Barindra Kumar    Ghose vs Emperor reported in CWN 1/14, Jenkins, J        observed as follows:    <br>    “A conspiracy consists not merely in the    intention of two or more, but in the agreement    of two or more to do an unlawful act, or to do a    lawful act by unlawful means. Though to:estab-    lish a charge of conspiracy there must be agree-    ment, there need not be proof of direct meeting    or combination, nor need the parties be brought    into each other’s presence, The agreement may    be inferred from ciroumstances raising a. pre-    sumption of a common concerted plan to carry    out the unlawful design. Nor is it necessary that    all should have joined in the scheme from the    first; those who come in at a later stage are        equally guilty, provided the agreement be    proved.” [emphasis added]                      some kind of physical manifestation of are    ment. The express agreement, however, need    not be proved, Nor actual meeting of two Ne    sons is necessary. Nor it is necessary to Prov,    the actual words of communication. The evi    dence as to transmission of thought sharing the        unlawful design may be sufficient.”        ",
      "369. The offence of conspiracy like any other    offence can be proved by direct evidence or by cir-    cumstantial evidence but in practice it is extremely    difficult to get direct evidence in proof of conspira-    cy. In the decision of the case of Nur Mohammad    Mohd. Yusuf Momin vs State of Maharashtra report-    ed in AJR 1971 SC 885 LD Dua, J held:      <br>  “A conspiracy from its very nature is gen-    erally hatched in secret. It is, therefore,    extremely rare that direct evidence in proof of    conspiracy can be forthcoming from wholly    disinterested quarters or from utter strangers.    But, like other offences, criminal conspiracy    can be proved by circumstantial evidence.    Indeed in most cases proof of conspiracy is    largely inferential though the inference must be    founded on solid facts. Surrounding circum-    stances and antecedent and subsequent conduct,    among other factors, constitute relevant materi-    al. In fact, because of the difficulties in having    direct evidence of criminal conspiracy, once    reasonable ground is shown for believing that    two or more persons have conspired to commit    an offence then anything done by any one of    them in reference to their common: intention    after the same is:entertained becomes, accord-    ing to the law of evidence, relevant for proving    both conspiracy and the offences. committed    pursuant thereto.”        ",
      "368. The offence of criminal conspiracy is    committed where there is an agreement by the two    Or more persons to do an illegal act or an act by ille-        gal means in furtherance of their common design.    AD 13        ",
      "367. It appears that learmed Judges of the    pivision Bench having examined the judgment and    ondet passed by the leamed Sessions Judge and also    evidence of 16 prosecution witnesses, namely, PW    43, PW 11 . PW 12 . PW 14, PW 21, PW 22, PW 24,    pw25, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW 39, PW    40, PW 41 and PW 44 found that the prosecution    successfully proved the charge of conspiracy under    section 120B of the Penal Code. Moreover, the sec-    ond leamed Judge having found the confessional    statements made by the accused appellants, namely,    Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,    Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan    znd Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Anillery) true and voluntary admitted the same as    legal piece of evidence and rightly convicted the    accused appellants under section 120B of the Penal    Code and, as such, no interference is called for by    this Hon’ble Court.        Section 120A and 120B of the Penal Code,    1860-Conspiracy:        “120A. When two or more persons agree to    do, or cause to be done,—      <br>  (1) an illegal act, or  <br>      (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal    means, such an agreement is designated a crim-    inal conspiracy: Provided that no agreement    except an agreement to commit an offence shall    amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some    act besides the agreement is done by one or    more parties to such agreement in pursuance    thereof.”        ",
      "366. According to the briefings of Lieutenant    Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman troops under the    command of the officers were deployed at the house    of Sheikh Fazlul Haq Moni, Abdur Rob Shemiabal,    Hon’ble Minister of Bangladesh, the radio station.    the Cantonment, distance to the Headquarters ol    Rakkhi Bahini and some were also deployed '    resist BDR; Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) was se\"    to terrorise the house guards in the residence of the    then President and also to resist the Rakkhi Bahin''!    so required, and Major Bazlul Huda, Major AKM    Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Aziz Pasha went over     the residence of the President and Resalder Mosle    Uddin went to the house of the then Preside\"    Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This sho”    that the said deployment of troops at the houses °    Fazlul Huq Moni. Abdur Rob Sherniabat, the\"    station, the corner of the Race Course, near the\"                      Teignon Airport, Mirpur Road, Kalabagan Lake    side were made not haphazardly but as a result of a    ‘yell-laid and pre-planned conspiracy in order not     to kill the then President with his family mem-    put also to ensure that no resistance to their    ‘ies was raised and no help could be rushed to    she place of occurrence to save the life of the then    acident of Bangladesh with members of his fami-    jyand others.          ",
      "365. The second learned Judge having consid,    ered the submissions advanced on behalf of the    accused appellants and respondent rightly found that    PW 25, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW 39, py,    40 and PW 41 had corroborated each other in Prov.    ing conspiracy and participation by the accused per.    sons. All the witnesses also stated in their evideng,    that the accused appellants, namely, Lieutenan    Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colone,    Abdur Rashid and Lieutenant Colonel Sharify    Haque Dalim having addressed the troops of the    Amny indoctrinated them to engage in conspiracy    and launch the operation in furtherance of their    common intention to achieve the ultimate goal in the    early morning of 15th August, 1975 . The accused    persons went to different places as per deployment    by Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and    his associates and assembled in those places in order    to commit the illegal act by illegal means and all of    them committed the offence under section 120B of    the Penal Code. It also appears from the evidence of    witnesses that First Bengal Lancer Regiment and        - Two Field Artillery Regiment were indoctrinated        and instigated to do a “special urgent duty in the    interest of the country”.        ",
      "364. From a careful scrutiny of the evidence    of the prosecution witnesses and also from the con-    fessional statement made by aforementioned three    accused appellants it appears that the conspiracy    started in the month of March,1975 at BARD,    Comilla, then in the month of June/July, 1975 in the    house of Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed at Doudkandi,    Comilla which was also attended by Lieutenant    Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Khondaker Abdur    Rashid, Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed,    Taheruddin Thakur and others. Thereafter the con-    spiracy continued in the house of Khondker    Moshtag Ahmed in Agha Masi Lane, Ramna Park,    and subsequently in Balurghat parade ground on the    following night of 14th August, 1975, PW 11, PW    12 and PW 14 in their evidence gave detailed    descriptions about the night parade held on the night    following on 14th August, 1975 . At the end of the    night parade, there was conference and briefings by    the accused Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque    Rahman and others. After midnight all the accused    persons and others who were assembling in the    parade ground of the Lancer Regiment and after giv-    ing final task to their conspiracy First Bengal Lancer    Unit with tanks and troops from 2nd Field Artillery    Regiment with cannons and light arms were    deployed in different places in the city ending at        Road No.32, Dhanmondi, Dhaka to commit the    offence. The second learned Judge of the Division    Bench has also considered the evidence of PW 21        PW 22, PW 24, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW    39, PW 40, PW 42 and PW 44 proving conspiracy    against the accused persons. The evidence of PW 21    manifests the preparation in 2nd Field Artillery    Regiment, the evidence of PW 22 shows the Prep,    ration for onslaught and the evidence of pw ,,    shows a retired Resalder of Ist Bengal Lance    Regiment directly participated in the conspiracy, t        ",
      "363. Inthe case of Mohd. Usman Mohammad    Hossain Maniyar vs State of Moharashtra reported    in AJR 1981 SC 1062, at page 1067 para 16 Baharul    Islam, J observed:    <br>    “It is true that there is no evidence of any    express agreement between the appellants to do                      or cause to be done the illegal act. For an    offence under section 120B the prosecution    need not necessarily prove that the perpetrators    expressly agreed to do or cause to be done the    illegal act; the agreement may be proved by    necessary implication. In this case, the fact that    the appellants were possessing and selling    explosive substances without a valid licence for    a pretty long time leads to the inference that    they agreed to do and/or caused to be done the    said illegal act, for, without such an agreement    the act could not have been done for such a long    time.”        ",
      "362. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, the learned    Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant    Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan,    has placed the relevant portion of the evidence and    submitted that the learned Judges of the Division    Bench erred in law in failing to find out that the    learned Sessions Judge relying on extraneous facts    and circumstances found the accused appellant    guilty under section 120B of the Penal Code without    any specific finding in respect of the said offence,    rather the trial Court relied on inadmissible evi-    dence. He has submitted that there was no legal evi-    dence against the appellant showing his complicity    in the offence of conspiracy. It appears that PW 43    had seen accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan attending in a meeting    at the house of Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed in the    month of June/July, 1975 . After the meeting at the    premises of a Madrasa at Daudkandi the accused    Shahriar, Faruque, Khondker Abdur Rashid also    attended a secret meeting with Khondker Moshtaq    Ahmed, Taheruddin Thakur and others. It is well    established that conspiracy is always hatched in    secrecy. In most cases it is impossible to adduce    direct evidence in proof of conspiracy. In the case of    Shivnarayan Laxminarayan Joshi vs State of    Moharastra reported in AIR 1980 SC 439, Fajal Ali,    J observed that a conspiracy is always hatched in    secrecy and it is impossible to adduce direct evi-    dence of the same. The offence can be only proved    largely from the inferences drawn from acts or ille-    gal omission committed by the conspirators in pur-    suance of a common design.        ",
      "361. In reply to the submission of Mr Khan    Saifur Rahman, the learned Advocate for the    accused appellant, the leamed Attorney-General has    submitted that the confessional statement made by    the accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed    Feruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Sultan    Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant Colonel    Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) are true and voluntary    and, as such, those statements should be taken into    consideration. The learned Attorney-General has    further submitted that on the evidence of witnesses,    namely PW 51 and PW 61 and also from the case    record it appears that the findings of the first learned    Judge in respect of section 10 was totally based on    misreading of evidence on record, All of them made    confessions voluntarily. The non-filing up of some    of the columns of the forms of confession by the    recording Magistrate is not fatal. In support of this    Contention he has referred to the case of State vs    Nolini reported in (1999) 5 SCC 353 and the case of    State vs Lalu Miah reported in 39 DLR (AD) ! 17 . In  reply to the submissions of learned Advocate for the    appellants to the effect that when a conspiracy has    Bone beyond the stage of conspiracy and offence Is    Committed in pursuance thereof, then conspiracy        becomes irrelevant i.e. no conviction can be award-        MAaJor BAZLUL Hupa vs STATE (MM Hossain J 95        ed for conspiracy if substantive offence is commit-    ted in pursuance thereof. To substantiate his argu-    ment, he has also referred to the decision in the case    of the State of Andhra Pradesh vs Kandimalla    Subbaiah reported in AJR 1961 SC 1241, State of    Kerala vs Sugathan reported in AJR 2000 SC 3323,    Kehar Singh vs State (Delhi Admn) reported in A/R    1988 SC 1883.        ",
      "360. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, Mr Abdur    Razaque Khan and Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the    learned Advocates for the appellants have submitted    in unison that the evidence and materials on record    will only show that there was no case of criminal    urder but the case of criminal con-    spiracy to commit mutiny to change the then Mujib    Government. Hence, the conviction and sentence of        accused appellants is liable to be set aside. They    have submitted that the allegation of mutiny carries    y within the defini-        with it the existence of conspirac    tion of the offence of mutiny. Having drawn our    attention to the evidence of witnesses, Mr Khan    Saifur Rahman has submitted that there was a con-    spiracy for mutiny and.not to commit murder of    President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with members of    his family. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman has also    referred to the opinion of the Third learned Judge    and submits that the Third learned Judge comment-    ed on the event of 15th August as revolting one and    the said findings of the Third learned Judge is a find-    ing of the situation as a mutiny obtaining in course    of the occurrence. He has submitted that there is no    direct evidence to the effect that the murder was    intended to be committed by the appellants. He has    also submitted that the places of deployment of    occurrence in the house of Abdur Rab Sherniabat    and Sheikh Fazlul Hug Moni are not included in the    charge and in the fact of the case and in the instant    case there is no account of conspiracy by any of the    co-accused of the case and thereby those places    added to the case events in the course of same trans-    action extending the facts of the case beyond its    place of occurrence are illegal merging of unrelated    evidence with the case and embellishing the case    with unrelated evidence and, as such, the conviction    and sentence of the accused appellants for commit-    ting murder and also for committing criminal con-    spiracy for murder are not tenable in law, Referring    to the decision in the case of Md Shamsul Haque vs    State reported in 20 DLR 540, he has submitted that    when a conspiracy has gone beyond the stage of    conspiracy and offence is committed in pursuance    thereof, then conspiracy becomes irrelevant i.e. no    conviction can be awarded for conspiracy if sub-    stantive offence is committed in pursuance thereof.    Mr Anisul Hug, the learned Advocate for the respon-    dent State, and Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned    Attorney-General, have submitted in unison that in conspiracy of m    the instant case the accused appellants have f,,    rightly convicted under section 120B of the Penal    Code as the charge against them for the gay,    offence of criminal conspiracy was proved beyong    reasonable doubt. Mr Mahbubey Alam has Submit.    ted that in the charge framed against the ACCUsey    appellants, nothing was mentioned about the con,    spiracy to commit the mutiny rather the charge    framed was conspiracy to commit murder, In reply    to the learned Advocate for the appellants, the    learned Attorney-General has submitted that the ey;.    dence of PWs as referred to by the learned defence    lawyer is of two-fold, one is relating to the circum.    stances prior to the occurrence and another is relat.    ed to the circumstance after the occurrence and thys    submitted that the evidence quoted by the learneg    defence Counsel cannot be taken to be an evidence    of mutiny rather it is the evidence of murder which    shall be taken into consideration in deciding the    case. According to the submission of learned    Attorney-General, the evidences on record and cir-    cumstances showed that the first object of the con-    spiracy was to kill Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur    Rahman and members of his family and, according-    ly, the convicts with pre-plan and pre-design came    out to kill Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman    and members of his family at House No.677, Road    No.32, Dhanmondi and to this end they mobilised    force for capturing radio station and other areas of    the city. The learned Attorney-General also asserted    that in the case of conspiracy in most cases direct    evidence is not normally found and it is proved by    the inference drawn from the circumstances and the    acts committed by the perpetrators in pursuance (0    their common design. He has referred to the deci-    sion of Shivnarayan Laxminarayan Joshi vs State of    Moharashtra reported in AIR 1980 SC 439 and    Mohd. Osman Mohammad Hossain Maniyur 8    State of Moharastra reported in AIR 1981 SC 1062.    In reply to the contention of the appellants, that al    the three learned Judges of the High Court Divisio\"    discarded the applicability of section 10 of M    Evidence Act and thus prosecution failed to prov’    the existence of criminal conspiracy through    application of section 10 of the Evidence Act, bot    the learned Attorney-General and Mr Anisul 104    have in unison submitted that section 10 of n    Evidence Act only makes certain fact relevant .    the purpose of conspiracy. On a clear reading section                              10 it appears that it is a Rule of evidence which    makes certain fact i.e. anything said, done or written    by any one of such persons (conspirator) in refer-    ence to their common intention after the time when    such intention was entertained as a relevant fact. In    the case of State of Maharashtra vs Damu Gopinath    shinde reported in AIR 2000 SC 1691, the Supreme    Court of India held that section 10 renders anything    said, done or written by anyone of the conspirators    in reference to their common intention as a relevant    fact, not only as against each of the conspirators but    for proving the existence of the conspiracy itself.    Further, the said fact can be used for showing that a    jcular person was a party to the conspiracy. The    only condition for application of the rule in section 10    is that there must be “reasonable ground to believe    that two or More persons have conspired together to    commit an offence.” The Supreme Court further held    that the basic principle which underlies in section 10    of the Evidence Act is the theory of agency and hence    every conspirator is an agent of his associate in car-    rying out the object of the conspiracy.        ",
      "359. In the case of Major EG Barsay vs State    of Bombay reported in AJR 1961 SC 1762, the    Supreme Court of India observed as follows:    <br>    “The scheme of the Act therefore is self-    evident. It applies to offences committed by    army personnel described is section 2 of the    Act; it creates new offences with specified pun-    ishments, imposes higher punishments to pre-    existing offences, and enables civil offences by    a fiction to be treated as offences under the Act;    it provides a satisfactory machinery for resolv-    ing the conflict of jurisdiction. Further it    enables, subject to certain conditions, an    accused to be tried successively both by Court    Martial and by a criminal Court, It does not    expressly bar the jurisdiction of criminal Courts    in respect of acts or omissions punishable under    the Act, if they are also punishable under any    other law in force in India; nor is it possible to    infer any prohibition by necessary implica-    tion.”                      ",
      "358. From the definitions of mutiny as con-    tained in section 35 of the Navy Ordinance, 1961.    we do not find that the prosecution has made out a    case of mutiny or there was any sign of failure of    command leading to mutiny rather from the evi-    dence of the witnesses both the Courts below, i.e.    the Court of Sessions and High Court Division, con-    currently found that the accused persons have com-    mitted conspiracy and murder. But both the Courts    have found that it is a case of murder and not a case    of mutiny leading to murder.        ",
      "357. We find that before pronouncement of    the judgment, the learned Sessions Judge vide his    order dated 24-3-1997 had served notice to con-    cerned authorities and the Army Headquarter as per    Provisions of Criminal Procedural Rules (Military    Offenders) 1958 vide Office Memo dated 2-4-1997    notifying that there is no bar to trying retired army    personnel in the criminal Court and thereby com-    plied with section 94 of the Army Act. So we do not    find any illegality as to the holding of trial before    criminal Court. (i.e. Sessions Court)        ",
      "356. Chapter 7 of the Penal Code provides for    offences relating to the Army, Navy and Air Force    and specifically, section 139 of the Penal Code pro-    yjges that persons subject to the aforesaid three    services are not subject to punishment under the    penal Code for any of the offences defined in    Chapter 7 . Section 5 of the Penal Code makes it    clear that any of the provisions of the Penal Code    does not intend to repeal, vary, suspend or affect any    of the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny        and desertion of officer, soldier or airman in the    service of Republic. So it appears that section 139 of    the Penal Code makes it abundantly clear that none    of the provisions of the Penal Code will repeal, vary    or affect the provision of any other law for punish-    ing mutiny. There is no difficulty for trial for mutiny    by the Court Martial if there is any such necessity. It    is well established that forum of trial is governed by    a procedural Jaw and the procedure followed by a    civil Court is much fairer and transparent then those    followed in the Court Martial and therefore there is    no chance of any prejudice to be caused to the    accused appellant. In the decision of the case of    Jamil Hug vs Bangladesh reported in 34 DLR (AD)    125 at page 138, paragraph 37 the Appellate    Division of the Supreme Court has quoted with    approval the observations of Prof. Holland pub-    lished in Law of Court Martial (Current Legal    Problem 1950 at page 193) which reads as follows:    <br>    “It is clear that present attitude of the    Courts whether justified by authority or not is in    favour of abdication controlling authority.    There is accordingly I suggest strong case for    the further reform I would accord-    ingly suggest that the jurisdiction of Court    Martial should be statutorily confined to the    offences against discipline and all the jurisdic-    tion over civil offences should be taken away    except where it is reasonable and impracticable    to arrange for a civil trial.”        ",
      "355. It also appears from the written State.    ment that none of the convict appellants, namely,    Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid    Khan, Mohiuddin (Artillery) at the time of examing.    tion under section 342 of the CrPC had made any    averment that the murders were committed in course    of mutiny. The evidences adduced in this case do not    show that the murders were committed in the course    of mutiny rather there was a conspiracy for commit.    ting murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur    Rahman and the members of his family and rela-    tions and that if anything had happened in the Army    it was after the commission of murder. The offence    of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal    Code is not an offence under the Army Act rather it    is a civil offence as defined in section 8(2) of the    Army Act. Sub-section (2) of section 59 of the Army    Act envisages that a person subject to this Act com-    mits an offence of murder, culpable homicide not    amounting to murder or rape in relation to the per-    son not subject to the Army Act shall not be guilty    of an offence against the said Act and shall not be    dealt with under this Act unless he commits any of    the said offences while on active service or at any    place outside Bangladesh or at a frontier post speci-    fied by the Government. When a Criminal Court and    Court Martial have concurrent jurisdiction to try 4    civil offence then under section 94 of the Army Act    it is the discretion of the prescribed Officer to decide    before which Court the proceedings shall be inst!-    tuted, If he decides that it should be instituted before    a Court Martial, then he can direct that the accused    shall be detained in military custody. But in the    instant case, the prescribed officer has neither exe    cised his jurisdiction nor instituted the proceedings    before the Court’ Martial. Furthermore, the convict    appellants did not even raise any objection before    the criminal Court during trial. It is only for the prescribed                       officer to decide as to the forum of trial and,    4S guch, in the instant case, neither the prescribed    jcer nor the accused appellant challenged the    fort of the trial, rather in the Appellate Division,    at pelated stage, such a challenge is not tenable in    jaw. Since in the instant case, trial of a civil offence    pefore a criminal Court is found to be legal and valid        gas such, the argument advanced by the defence    is not tenable in law,        ",
      "354. From careful scrutiny of the aforesaid    statements of the PWs, it appears that the killing for    which the convict appellants and others were con-    victed and sentenced were not done in course of    mutiny. From the judgment of the first Hon'ble    Judge of the Division Bench, we found that there    was no mutiny in the Army in the night following            14th/early morning of 15th August, 1975 . The This    learned Judge also came to the same conclusion an    observed as under:        “From all this aforesaid evidences Of the    persons in authority and Army, Navy, Air Fotce    BDR, Police and Rakkhi Bahini having owed    the allegiances and no chain of command Wan    ever disturbed, there was no mutinous situation,    as contemplated in the aforesaid section.        ",
      "352. It has been well settled by the Appellate    Division of the Supreme Court in the case of Haider                      Ali Khan vs State reported in 1994 BLD (AD) 270 =    47 DLR (AD) 47 that the jurisdiction of Court below    cannot be challenged in appeal at a belated stage.    The learmed Attorney-General during the course of    his submission has also drawn our attention to the    cases where appellant Syed Faruque Rahman chal-    lenged the shifting of the Court in Writ Petition    No.2032 of 1997 which was reported in 49 DLR    (AD) 157 and the case of Sultan Shahriar Rashid    Khan and Syed Faruque Rahman which went upto    the Appellate Division reported in 3 BLC (AD) 89    where the accused appellant never challenged the    jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that the mur-    ders were committed in the course of mutiny.                ",
      "351. In the case of Balbir Singh vs Punjab    n 1995 1 SCC 90, the accused persons    the active service of the Air Force were        convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge under    sections 302 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code. It    was contended on behalf of the accused that since he    was in active service, he should be tried before the    Court Martial, The Supreme Court dismissed. the    appeal and observed as follows:  <br>      “When a criminal Court and Court-Martial    each have jurisdiction in respect of the trial of    the offence, it shall be the discretion of the offi-    cer commanding the group, wing or station in    which the accused in serving or such other offi-    cer as may be prescribed, in the first instance, to    decide before which Court the proceedings    shall be instituted and if that officer decides that    they should be instituted before a “Court    Martial”, to direct that the accused persons shall    be detained in Air Force custody. Thus, the    option to try a person subject to Air Force Act    who commits an offence while on “active serv-    ice” is in the first instance with the Air Force    Authorities. The criminal Court, when such an    accused is brought before it, shall not proceed    to try such a person or to inquire with a view to    this commitment for trial and shall give a notice    to the commanding officer of the accused, to    decide whether they would like to try the    accused by a Court Martial or allow the crimi-    nal Courts to proceed with the trial. In case, the    Air Force Authorities decide either not to try    such a person by a Court Martial or fail to exer-    cise the option when intimated by the criminal    Court within the period prescribed by Rule 4 of    the 1952 Rules, the accused can be tried by the    ordinary criminal Court in accordance with the    Code of Criminal Procedure. On the other hand,    if the Authorities under the Act opt to try the    accused by the ‘Court Martial’, the criminal    Court shall direct delivery of the custody of the    accused to the Authorities under the Act and to    forward to the authorities a statement of the    offence of which he is accused. It is explicit that    the option to try the accused subject to the Act    by a Court Martial is with the Air Force    Authorities and the accused has no option or    right to claim trial by a particular forum.”        ",
      "350. Thereafter the Judge handed over the    “ed to the Naval Authority which was chal-    gel 4, Supreme Court held that the Judge was cor-    lente handing over the accused persons to the    reo Authority after receiving reply from the    Nie anding Officer. In the case of Joginder Singh    a machal Pradesh reported in AIR 1971 SC 500    \" accused, a Lance Naik, raped a ten years old girl.    a was convicted under section 376 of the Indian    penal Code. The conviction was challenged before    the Appellate Court on the ground that section 549    of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been    complied with. While dismissing the appeal the    Supreme Court of India observed as under:        “In respect of an offence which could be    tried both by a criminal Court as well as Court    Martial, sections 125, 126 and the Rules have    made suitable provisions to avoid a conflict of    jurisdiction between the criminal Courts and the    Court Martial. But it is to be noted that in the    first instance, discretion is left to the officer    mentioned in section 125 to decide before    which Court the proceedings should be institut-    ed. Hence, the officer commanding the army,    army corps, division or independent brigade in    which the accused person is serving or such    other officer as may be prescribed will have to    exercise his discretion and decide under section    125 in which Court the proceedings shall be    instituted. It is only when he so exercises his    discretion that the proceeding should be insti-    tuted before a Court Martial, that the provisions    of section 126(1) come into operation, If the    designated officer does not exercise his discre-    tion and decide that the proceedings should be    nstituted before a Court Martial, the Army Act    Would not obviously be in the way of a criminal    Court exercising it’s ordinary jurisdiction in the    manner provided by law.”        ",
      "349. From the aforesaid provisions of sections    94 and 95 of the Army Acct it appears that in the case    of murder there is concurrent jurisdiction by both    the Court Martial and the ordinary criminal Cour.    But section 59(2) of the Army Acct stipulates that a    case of murder cannot be tried under the Army Act    if the victims are not subject to the Army Act unless    the accused commits the offence while on active    service or at any place outside Bangladesh or at a    frontier post specified by the Government. It also    appears that application of section 59(1) is also lim-    ited by section 92(2) of the Army Act which pro-    vides that trial shall commence within 6 months    after he had ceased to be subject to this Act. It tra    spires that in the instant case there is concurrent    jurisdiction, the Sessions Court had complied with    all formalities necessary under sections 94 and 95 of    the Army Act and section 549 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure by sending notice to the Chief    of Staff, Army under Rule 2 of Criminal Procedure    Rules (Military Offenders) 1958 with regards to th?    trial of the accused persons as evidenced by ° i\"    No.12 dated 3-4-1997 . In the case of MSK /bral™    Commander in Chief, Royal Pakistan Navy repo    in 8 DLR (SC) 128 the accused, an official a    Pakistan Navy, was charged with theft and was     produced before the Special Judge who addressed vi    ter to the Commanding Officer, in accordance with                      section 549 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,    <oction whether the appellant was to be tried by a    eng’ \"Martial or the Judge himself.        ",
      "348. It is also necessary to reproduce section    549 of the CrPC which reads as under:    <br>    “549 . Delivery to military authorities of    person liable to be tried by Court Martial, (1)    The Government may make rules consistent    with this Code and the Bangladesh Army Act,    1952 (XXXIX of 1952), the Bangladesh Air    Force Act, 1953 (VI of 1953), and the    Bangladesh Navy Ordinance, 1961 (XXXV of    1961), and any similar law for the time being in    force as to the cases in which persons subject to    military, naval or air force law, shall be tried by    a Court to which the Code applies, or by Court    Martial, and when any person is brought before        a Magistrate and charged with an Offer    which he is liable, to be tried either b Nee ig    to which this Code applies or by Court yoo\"    such Magistrate shall have regard to sug Arti)    and shall in proper cases deliver him,\"    with a statement of the offence of which Bethe,    accused, to the commanding officer Of the Cis    ment, corps, ship or detachment, to Which    belongs, or to the commanding officer of e    nearest military, naval or air force Station, as the    case may be, for the purpose of being tried :    Court Martial. y      <br>  (2) Apprehension of such persons.

      "347. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned    Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respon-    dent, has submitted that in the instant case the    offence of murder has been tried and no charge of    mutiny has been brought against the accused appel-    Jants. The learned Judges of the Division Bench as    well as the Third learned Judge upon consideration    of evidence and materials on record have not found    any case of mutiny rather they found the case of    murder and accordingly, they have awarded their    verdict. He has argued that raising the issue of    mutiny by the defence to challenge the jurisdiction    of the trial Court at the appellate stage for the first    time is not tenable in law. He has referred to the case    of Haider Ali Khan vs State reported in 1994 BLD    (AD) 270 = 47 DLR (AD) 47 and the case of    Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto vs State reported in PLD 1979    SC 53 . Mr Attorney-General having referred to the    Writ Petition No.2032 of 1997 filed on behalf of the    appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque    Rahman, challenging the sitting of the Court to    Nazim Uddin Road which has gone upto the    Appellate Division having been reported in 49 DLR    (AD) 157 and also the Writ Petition submitted on    behalf of the appellant Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan    and Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,    challenging the vires of the Indemnity Repeal Act,    1997 in the High Court Division which has gone        Upto the Appellate Division reported in 3 BLC (AD)    89 has submitted that the accused appellant had    never challenged the jurisdiction of the Court on the        round that it was a case of mutiny leading to mur-    der not a case of murder simplictter and, as such the    appellant’s contention that the civil Court has no    jurisdiction to try the offence of murder is not ten-    able in law. The learned Attorney-General has    drawn our attention to the refusal of the first Judge    in granting leave to make submission on the point of    mutiny since the prosecution has no case of mutiny    but a case of murder committed in the fateful night    of 14th August and the early hours of 15th August,    1975 . Mr Mahbubey Alam has also referred to the    conclusions and observations made by the Third    learned Judge. The learned Attorney-General having    drawn our attention to the written statements made    by the convict appellants, namely, Lieutenant    Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar    Rashid Khan and Mohiuddin (Artillery), have sub-    mitted that none of the appellants made any aver-    ment to the effect that murders were committed in    course of mutiny. He has also reiterated the submis-    sions made by Mr Anisul Hug to the same effect that    since in the instant case neither any discretion was    exercised in taking a decision by the prescribed offi-    cer under section 94 of the Army Act nor any ques-    tion was raised by the convict appellants in the trial    Court as to the forum of trial and, as such, the con-    vict appellants are not entitled to challenge the    forum of trial for the first time in the Apex Court. In    this context Mr Attorney-General has referred to the    case of Major EG Barsay vs State of Bombay    reported in AJR 1961 SC 1762 . Having referred to    the case of Jamil Hug vs Bangladesh reported in 34    DLR (AD) 125, he has submitted that forum of trial    being governed by a procedural law and the proce-    dure followed in Civil Court is much fairer and    transparent than that the procedure followed in    Court Martial, the question of prejudice to the con-    vict appellant does not arise at all. The offence of    mutiny has not been defined in the Army Act, 1952.    But section 31 of the Army Act provides for punish-    ment for the offence of mutiny and insubordination.    However, mutiny is defined under section 35 of the    Naval Ordinance, 1961 . According to section 94 of    the Army Act, a criminal Court under Court Martial    has jurisdiction in respect of a Civil offence and the    prescribed officer has discretion to decide as to    which Court the proceedings shall be instituted and    if that officer decides that the proceedings shall be                      instituted before the Court Martial then he will    direct that the accused persons shall be detained in    military custody. Sections 94 and 95 of the Army    Act, 1952 and section 549 of the CrPC set out the    procedure in the case of concurrent jurisdiction of    Court Martial and Criminal Court. In this context it    Will be profitable to quote sections 94 and 95 of the    Army Act which are as follows:    <br>    “04 . When a criminal Court and a Court    Martial have each jurisdiction in respect of a    civil offence, it shall be in the discretion of the    prescribed officer to decide before which Court    the proceedings shall be instituted and, if that    officer decides that they shall be instituted    before a Court Martial, to direct that the    accused person shall be detained in military    custody.      <br>  95.(1) When a criminal Court having juris-    diction is of the opinion that proceedings ought    to be instituted before itself in respect of any    civil offence, it may, by written notice, require    the prescribed officer, at his option, either to    deliver over the offender to the nearest magis-    trate to be proceeded against according to law, or    to postpone proceedings pending a reference to    the Government. (2) In every such case, the said    officer shall either deliver over the offender in    compliance with the requisition or shall forth-    with refer the question as to the Court before    which the proceedings are to be instituted for the    determination of the Government, whose order    upon such reference shall be final.”        ",
      "346. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Advocate    appearing for the respondent has submitted that the    present case not being a case of mutiny rather a case    of murder simpliciter, no illegality was committed    by trying the accused appellants in the Criminal    Court because, even if for the sake of argument,    though not conceding, along with mutiny there was    also murder, Mr Huq has submitted that in case o!    civil offence like murder there was a concurrent    jurisdiction both in the Court Martial and Criminal    Court as per provisions of sections 94 and 95 of the    Army Act and the formalities required thereunder    along with section 549 of the CrPC have been fully    complied with and, as such, no illegality is commit    ted by holding the trial of the case in a crim    Court. Mr Anisul Huq has submitted that the a    ment in the leave granting order No.3 to the     that ‘“‘whether there is mutiny leading to murder or                      murder simpliciter” is misconceived because for    murder like the present case there is concurrent    jurisdiction under section 59(2) of the Army Act,    952 . He then has submitted that in the instant case    ore being concurrent jurisdiction the Sessions    court having fully complied with the provisions of    eections 94 and 95 of the Army Act and section 549    of the CrPC as evidenced by the Sessions Court's    rdet dated 24-3-1997 and 3-4-1997 held the trial    and, such, no illegality is committed in holding    the trial. In this context he has referred to the deci-    <jons in the cases of MSK Ibrat vs Commander-in-    chief Royal Pakistan Navy reported in 4 DLR (SC)    128, Balbir Singh vs Punjab reported in 1995 1 SCC 90.        ",
      "345. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned    Asvocate appearing for the appellants in Criminal    Appeal Nos.56 and 58 of 2007, submits that on a    clear analysis of the evidence and materials on    record it appears that the instant case is a case of    mutiny leading to murder of the President,    Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and mem-    bers of his family and relations and not a case of    murder simpliciter and, as such, the conviction of    the accused appellants by a normal criminal Court    instead of Court Martial has vitiated the trial. Mr    Khan has argued that series of events, activities,    briefings, exercises and happenings, having had    happened in Dhaka Cantonment in the night preced-    ing the fateful event occurring in the House No. 677,    Road No. 32, Dhanmondi, clearly constituted    mutiny and it does not indicate any case of murder    simpliciter. The place of occurrence includes the    cantonment and the cantonment activities, briefings    and exercises include the fact of the case and as    such, no case of agreement or pre-arranged plan,    pre-concert, common intention, criminal conspiracy    or object for common intention within the scope of    section 34 or section 120A of the Penal Code can be        lawfully inferred. Mr Khan then submits that killing    of persons in the course of mutiny is triable by a    Court Martial and in this context he has referred to    section 59 of the Army Act, 1952 and submits that    since the accused persons were in active service at    the time of the commission of offence, they should    have been in all fairness tried before a Court Martial    instead of criminal Court: In this context he has    referred to the case of Jamil Huq vs Bangla)    reported in 34 DLR 161 (AD) 125 and sub its be    for the mutiny which took place in the     29th/30th May, 1981 resulting in death of 7; of    Rahman, President of Bangladesh trial Was ete    exclusively by a Court Martial as per Provision    section 31 of the Army Act and, as such, the tire    of the President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on the    fateful night of the 15th August by the Army per-    sonnel who were in active service should have been    tried by a Court Martial instead of a criminal Court    and, as such, the conviction and sentence Of the    accused appellant is not tenable in law. Mr Khan hag    argued that the severity of penalty in case Of mutiny    and in case of murder not being the same and the    difference is to the advantage of the appellants in a    trial by Court Martial since in the case of Punish.    ment for murder there is only one alternative of    death penalty to imprisonment for life. He has    argued that under section 31 of the Army Act any    sentence alternative to death sentence carries much    lesser punishment as mentioned in the Army Act,    1952 . Mr Khan Saifur Rahman has submitted that    the plea of concurrent jurisdiction by the respondent    for the trial of the case by criminal Court or the    Court Martial basing on the provisions of sections    91 and 92 of the Army Act, 1952 had lost its force in    view of the proviso to section 92(2) of the Army Act    and that the question of concurrent jurisdiction of    trial of the case is misconceived.        ",
      "344. Mahim Mondal vs State reported in 15    DLR 615 . In this case the appellant, Mahim Mondal,    along with other accused persons were tried under    sections 304 and 148 and various other sections. of    the Penal Code. Mahim Mondal was convicted    under sections 304 and. 148 of the Penal Code and    sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five    years and one year respectively. Accused Asab    Mondal was convicted under section 323 of the    Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigorous impris-    onment for six months, Appellant Mohim Mondal    preferred an appeal against the conviction and sen-    tence passed against him. Upon admission of the    appeal, a Division Bench issued a suo motu Rule    asking to show cause as to why the conviction and    sentence passed against the accused under the said    Code should not be set aside. The revision case aris-    es out of the Rule which was issued by the same    Court. After hearing the appeal and the revision case    a Division Bench differed in their opinion as to                      whether the accused Mahim Mondal could have    been convicted of rioting. Consequently, the matter    was laid before the Third Judge, Morshed, J under    section 429 of the CrPC In his judgment Morshed, J    held that the whole case is required to be laid before    the Third Judge and it is his duty to consider all the    points involved before he delivers his opinion upon    the case. State vs Abul Khair reported in 44 DLR    284 . In this case two Judges of the Division Bench    differed on the validity of conviction and sentence    of two appellants but agreed in respect of conviction    of one accused, namely, Abul Khair. The case was    laid before the Third Judge. The Third learned Judge    only dealt with the case of the two accused, namely,    Mosharraf and Moinuddin i.e. with regards to whom    the Judges had differed.        ",
      "343. In the case of Granade Venkata vs    Corporation of Calcutta reported in 22 CWN 745    the accused was prosecuted and convicted under    section 495A(1) of the Calcutta Municipal Act for    selling adulterated ghee. The Magistrate allowed the    defence to rely on this evidence which was obtained    by cross-examination of the Assistant Analyst to the    Corporation who applied certain processes of analy-    sis to the sample of ghee in question and obtained    certain results from which he made the deduction    that the ghee had been adulterated with certain per-    Centages of foreign fat. No other witness has been    ¢xamined on either side and the defence contended    that according to the standard works on the subject    no such deduction could be made. Defence cross-    examined the analyst. The Magistrate allowed the    defence to rely on this evidence, dealt with it as    being the evidence in the judgment. The Rule,    against the conviction was heard before two Judges,    both of whom agreed that the conviction could not    stand. Chitty, J was for a retrial on the ground that    there was no satisfactory investigation and Smither,    J held otherwise. The matter was laid before the    Third Judge Woodroffe, J who held that in a case    referred under. section 420, CrPC, a Third Judge    would not differ upon a point on which both the    referring Judges were agreed unless there were    Strong grounds for doing so. In the case of    Muhammed Shafi vs Crown reported in 6 DLR (WP)    /04 the full Bench of the High Court held that nei-    ther section 378 nor section 429 prevents the obtain-    ing of the decision of the full Bench upon a question    of law or subsequent delivery of the opinion of the    Third Judge upon the whole case. The Third Judge    before whom the case is laid under section 429 of    the Criminal Procedure Code exercise the authority    of a Bench of Judges and therefore, he should be    considered not as a single Judge, but as a Bench.    The case is not one which is dealt with in fact by a    single Judge, but one which is dealt with by three    Judges, even though the Third Judge is dealing with    it at a later stage then the two disagreeing Judges.        ",
      "342. When the appeal as a whole is heard by    the Third Judge, he not only has an option of deliy-    ering his opinion but, under the proviso to section    302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he may    require the appeal to be re-heard and decided by a    larger Bench of Judges. This was an option which,    under the proviso, was also open for any one of the    two Judges, namely, BN Katju and Rajeshwar    Singh, JJ to exercise, but they chose not to do so,    What is clearly evident is that the appeal is finally    disposed of by the judgment and order which fol-    lows the opinions of the Third Judge. This being so    special leave petition could only have been filed    afier the appeal was disposed of by the High Court    yield its final order dated 19-5-1988 . Even though    the said order purports to relate only to ten out of    thirty-two accused the said order has to be read    along with the earlier order of 15-4-1987 and, in    law, the effect would be that the order dated 19-5-    1988 will be regarded as the final order whereby the    appeal of the State was partly allowed, with only    two of the thirty-two accused being convicted under    section 325 read with 34 IPC, while all the other    accused were acquitted.”        ",
      "341. In the case of State of UP vs Dan Sing    reported in (1997) 3 SCC 747 32 accused persons    were charged under sections 147, 302/ 149, 43 6iige    307/149 of the Indian Penal Code and under se    tions 4(iv), (x) and section 5.7 of the Protection, *    the Civil Rights Act, 1955 . The Sessions Jud  acquitted all the 32 accused persons including Dan    Singh and others. State preferred appeal before the    High Court, Allahabad. Katju, J convicted two    accused, namely, Jit Singh and Kishan Sing unde,    sections 325 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code ang    sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for    five years and acquitted 30 accused Persons. By a    separate opinion Rajeshwar Singh, J convicteg six    accused men and four ladies and acquitted 2)    accused persons. The first order was of the Division    Bench regarding the acquittal of 22 accused persons.    Thereafter the case was laid before the Third learned    Judge. The Third learned Judge Mathur, J after hear-    ing the appeal of ten accused to which the two    learned Judges differed, agreed with Katju, J con.    victing two accused, namely, Jit Singh and Kishan    Sing and acquitted 30 accused persons. One special    leave petition was filed by the State against all the    32 accused persons. Leave was not granted in the    case of 4 ladies and accordingly their acquittal has    become finality and leave was granted against 28    accused persons. Supreme Court of India observed    as under:        “According to this section if there is a dif-    ference of opinion amongst the Judges of the    Bench, then their Opinions are laid before        another Judge. It is only after the Third Judge    gives his opinion that the judgment or order fol-    lows. It is clear from this that the judgment of    order which can be appealed against, undet    Article 136 of the Constitution, is only th!    Which follows after the opinion of the Lat    Judge has been delivered. What BN Katju an                       Rajeshwar Singh, JJ. wrote was not their judg-    ments but they were their opinions, Due to dis-    agreement amongst them, section 392 of the    Code of Criminal Procedure required the appeal    as a Whole to be laid before the Third Judge (vs    Pp Mathur, J in this case) whose opinion was to    prevail. The first order of 15-4-1987 was clear-    ly not contemplated by section 392 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure and is, therefore, non est.        ",
      "340. In the case of Nemai Mondal ys State of    West Bengal reported in AJR 1966 . Calcuting 194    there were ten appellants. Both the learned Judges of    the Division Bench were unanimous that the con-    viction of the appellant Nos.1, 9 and 19 sh    set aside. Therefore appellant Nos.1, 9 and |    been set at liberty and there is no difference of has    ion about them. The difference of opinio Din,    comes up for decision is with respect to appt at    Nos.2-8 were dealt by the Third Judge. Mukhags.    held that the case with the differing Opinion she    be placed before the Third Judge.         ",
      "339. In the case of Sarat Chandra Mitra vs    Emperor reported in ILR 38 Cal 2002 the learned    Judges of the Division Bench are equally divided in    respect of one of the accused, Sarat Chandra Mitra    and the matter was laid before the Third Judge. The    Supreme Court of India held that in the case of two    prisoners, regarding the guilt of one of whom only    the Judges of the Appellate Court are divided in    opinion, it may be that what has to be laid before    another Judge is the case of such prisoner alone, But    where they are equally divided as the guilt of one    accused, though in certain aspects they may be    agreed, the whole case as regards the accused is laid    before the Third Judge, and not merely the point or    points on which there is difference of Opinion, and it    is his duty to consider all the points involved before    . delivering his opinion upon the case,        ",
      "338. In Radha Mohan Singh vs State of UP    (2006) 2 SCC 450 five accused persons were con-    victed under sections 147, 148, 323, 324 and 302    read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and    imposed sentence of various terms of imprisonment    includingNife imprisonment under section 302 read    with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The    accused appellant preferred appeal in the Allahabad    High Court. In the Division Bench, first learned    Judge Agarwal, J allowed the appeal and set aside    the conviction and sentence imposed thereunder but    the second Judge Mishra, J dismissed the appeal and    thereby upheld the conviction and sentence passed    by the leamed Sessions Judge. The matter was    referred to the Third Judge who upheld the convic-    tion for all. On appeal, the Supreme Court held that    the Third learned Judge is under no obligation to    accept the view of one of the Judges holding in    favour of acquittal of the accused either as a rule of    prudence or on the scope of judicial etiquette. It is    not possible to accept the contention raised by the    appellant.        ",
      "337. In the case of Mattar vs State of UP    (2002) 6 SCC 460 two accused persons were con-    victed under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian Penal    Code, one of the accused died during the pendency    of the appeal before the High Court. In High Court    first Judge acquitted the appellant and the second    Judge convicted him. The matter was referred to the    Third Judge who dismissed the appeal and convict-    ed the accused appellant. The Supreme Court of    India held that the Third learned Judge, under these    circumstances, was required to independently examine                      the matter and express his opinion. It is not per-    missible to only or merely indicate the agreement    with one or the other view without giving reasons    therefor.        ",
      "336. In the case of Sajjan Singh vs State of    MP reported in (1999) 1 SCC 315 at page-324 para-    10 the Supreme Court held that it is the Third Judge    whose opinion matters; against the judgment that    follows therefrom that an appeal lies to the Supreme    Court by way of special leave petition under Article    136 of the Constitution or under Article 134 of the    Constitution or under section 379 of the Code.        ",
      "335. Mr Justice GN Ray observed as under:        “In, Babu vs State of Uttar Pradesh, (AIR    1965 SC 1467), it has been held by Constitution    Bench of this Court that where the Third Judge    did not consider it necessary to decide a partic-    ular point on which there had been difference of    opinion between the two Judges, but simply    indicated that if at all it was necessary for him    to come to a decision on the point, he agreed    with all that had been said about by one of the    two Judges, such decision was in conformity    with law. That the Third Judge is free to decide    the appeal in the manner he thinks fit, has been    reiterated in, Hethubha vs State of Gujarat,    (AIR 1970 SC 1266) and Union of India vs BN    Anantha Padma Nabiah, AIR 1971 SC 1836 . In    State of A. PV PT Appaiah, AIR 1981 SC 365, it    has been held by this Court that even in a case    when both the Judges had held that the accused    was guilty but there was difference of opinion    as to the nature of offence committed by the    accused, it was open to the Third Judge to    decide the appeal by holding that the accused    was not guilty by considering the case on    merit.”        ",
      "334. In the case of Tanviben Pankajkumar    Divetia vs State of Gujarat reported in AJR 1997    SCC 7156 the accused appellant was convicted    under section 302 read with section 34 of the Indian    Penal Code against which he preferred appeal    before the Gujarat High Court. A Division Bench of    the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by    the State against the acquittal of the appellant of the    charges levelled under section 302 read with section    120B of the Penal Code and section 302 of the    Indian Penal Code. One Judge acquitted the accused    and the other Judge convicted the accused, The mat-    ter was referred to Third Judge. The Third learned    Judge upheld the conviction of the appellant under    section 302 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, the    appeal of the appellant was dismissed by the High    Court. On appeal, the Supreme Court of India held    that:    “it is for the Third Judge to decide on. what    points he shall hear arguments, if any, and it    necessarily postulates that the Third Judge is    free to decide the appeal by resolving the dif-    ference in the manner he thinks proper.”        ",
      "333. In the case of State of Andhra Pradesh vs    PT Appaiah reported in AJR 1981 SC 265 . two    accused persons were convicted under sections 302    and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced     of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life. \"    appeal the Division Bench Judges differed the    nature of the offence that was committed by '    accused in causing the injury. Madhava Reddy’    held punishable under section 304 Part of     Penal Code and Sriramula, J dismissed the appeal                      holding that the Sessions Judge rightly convicted the    accused under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian    Penal Code. But the Third Judge Ramchandra Raju,    J acquitted both the accuseds. Supreme Court held    that the Third Judge before whom the case was laid    for opinion is competent to deal with the whole case    and he is not bound to confine his judgment only to    the matter conceming difference of opinion between    the other two Judges. The Supreme Court have    relied with observations made in the case of Union    of India vs BN Anantha Padma Nabiah reported in    AIR 1971 SC 1836 which runs as follows:      <br>  “This question came up for consideration    in the recent unreported decision in Hethubha    vs State Of GujfArdt    This Court held that the Third learned Judge    could deal with the whole case. The language of    section 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure    is explicit that the case with the opinion of the    Judges comprising the Court of Appeal shall be    laid before another Judge of the same Court.    The other noticeable feature in section 429 of    the Code of Criminal Procedure is that the judg-    ment or order shall follow the opinion of the    Third learned Judge.”        ",
      "332. In the case of Union of India vs BN    Anantha Padma Nabiah reported in AIR 1971 SC    1836 there was difference of opinion regarding all    the accused persons. Reference was made to the    Third Judge. In this case Supreme Court considered    the case of Bhagat Ram vs State of Rajasthan report-    ed in (1972) 3 SCR 303 where the Third Judge held    that Bhagat Ram was guilty of the offence under    section 389 and also sections 120B, 218 and 347 of    the Indian Penal Code. It has been held that it was    not permissible for the Third Judge to re-open the    matter and convict Bhagat Ram of the offences    under section 120B and 218 of the Indian Penal    Code as the Division Bench comprising the first and    second Judge confirmed the acquittal of Bhagat    Ram in respect of charge under sections 347, 218,    389 and 120B of the Penal Code. In the case 4,    entire matter relating to acquittal of conviction ang    sentence of Bhagat Ram had not been left ope,    because of difference of opinion between the two    Judges. The Supreme Court of India in the case gf    Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in AIR 1979    SC 1266 observed that the scope of section 429    CrPC was not confirmed in Bhagat Ram’s case, No    question was raised whether the Judges of the    Division Bench restrict the power of the Third Judge    under section 429 nor the notice of the Court    appears to have been drawn to three earlier dec).    sions of the Court on the point, namely, in the case    of Babu vs State of UP reported in AIR 1966 sc    1467, Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in 4/p    1970 SC 1266 and Union of India vs BN Anantha    Padma Nabiah reported in AJR 1971 SC 1836 which    was unreported when Bhagat Ram’s case was decid-    ed. Having considered all these three cases the    Supreme Court tried in the case of Babu vs State of    UP reported in AIR 1966 SC 1467 held that section    429, CrPC contemplates that it is for the Third Judge    to decide on what points he shall hear arguments, if    any, and that postulates that he is completely free in    resolving the difference as he thinks fit. In the case    of Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in AIR    1970 SC 1266 the Supreme Court having considered    the decision reported in AJR 1965 SC 1467 held that    two things are noticeable in section 429 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure: firstly, the case shall be laid    before another Judge, and, Secondly, the judgment    and order will follow the opinion of the Third    learned Judge. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held    that the Third learned Judge can or will deal with the    whole case and that the Third learned Judge    whom the case was referred under section 429 has    not overstated the limits in deciding the case as @    whole. The appeal was dismissed accordingly.        ",
      "331. In the case of Babu vs State of the UP    reported in AJR 1965 SC 1467, the appeal was    against conviction and sentence’ of four accused    appellants under sections 304 and 34 of the Indian    Penal Code. First learned Judge dismissed the    appeal disbelieving some part of the evidence and -    the second learned Judge allowed the appeal. The    Supreme Court of India held that section 429 of the    Code of Criminal Procedure contemplates that it is    for the Third Judge to decide on what points he shall    hear arguments if any and that postulates that he was |completely free in resolving difference as he thinks     fit. In the case of Hethubha vs State of Gujarat    reported in AIR 1970 SC 1266 the trial Court acquit-    ted all the three accused persons under sections 302    read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code but    convicted all the accused persons ‘for the offences                      punishable under sections 304 Part-2 read with sec-    tion 34 and sentenced them to suffer rigorous    imprisonment for five years. Accused No.1-    Hethubha and No.2-Ranubha were convicted for the    offences punishable under section 323 and accused    No.3-Malubha was convicted for the offence pun-    ishable under section 323 read with section 34 of the    Indian Penal Code. The accused Nos.1 and 2 were    sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three    months while accused No.2 was sentenced for two    months and all the sentences were to run concur-    rently, All the accused preferred appeals against    their convictions before the Division Bench in the    Hich Court of Gujarat. Divan, J held that accused    No.1 was guilty for the offence under section 302    and accused Nos.2 and 3 were found guilty under    section 324 read with section 34 . Shelat, J acquitted    all the accused because he was not satisfied with the    evidence of proof of the identity of the accused. The    case was placed before the Third learned Judge    Mehta, J under section 429 of the Code who found    accused No.1 guilty under section 302 and accused    Nos.2 and 3 guilty under section 302 read with sec-    tion 34 and all of them were sentenced to suffer rig-    orous imprisonment for life. The conviction of    accused Nos.] and 2 under section 323 and of the    accused No.3 under section 323 read with section 34    was upheld. The conviction of all the accuseds    under section 304 Part-2 was altered as stafed above.    On appeal, the Supreme Court of India held that the    Third Judge was competent to deal with the whole    case.        ",
      "330. During the course of hearing the learned    Advocates from both sides have made elaborate    submissions on the scope and jurisdiction of the    Third learned Judge. It has come to our notice that    Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned Advocate in    Criminal Appeal Nos.56 of 2007 and    Whose arguments have been adopted by the learned    Advocate for the other appellants, has referred to the    case reported in 1999 SCC (CRI) 44, ILR 38 Cal    202, 1970 (1) SCC (Cr) 280, 1971 SCC (Cri) 535,    15 DLR 615 and he has also submitted that the    expression “as he thinks fit” does not qualify the    word “hearing” and there is no co-relation between    “hearing” and “as he thinks fit” and accordingly he    has submitted that for breach of the provisions of    section 377 of the Code for not signing the judgment    by two Judges, there is no judgment in the eye of    law. As such the judgment and order of conviction    and sentence is not tenable in law. From our careful    scrutiny we have found that the same cases are also    relied on by the respondents in support of their con-    tentions. It would be profitable for us to examine the    relevant decisions in this context. In the case of    Dharam Singh vs State of UP reported in 1964 (1)    CrLJ 78, there was difference regarding all the    accuseds. In this case trial Judge convicted ten    accused persons under sections 302 and 149 of the    Indian Penal Code and acquitted two accused per-    sons. The State appealed against acquittal and ten    accused persons preferred appeal against convic-    tion. A Division Bench of the High Court differed in    their opinions and the matter was laid before the    Third learned Judge who concurring with one of the    Judges upheld the conviction of ten appellants and    set aside the acquittal of one accused, where the    judgment and order of the Court has followed the    opinion of Third learned Judge.        ",
      "329. From the above expressions we find that    the words “of the same Court” after the words    “nother Judge” and the. expression “if any” after    the expression “such hearing” do not exist in section    378 . By adding these two expressions in section 429    of the Code the legislature intended to say that when    the Judges of the Division Bench are equally divid-    ed in opinion while disposing appeal, the case with    their opinions thereon shall be laid before another        Judge of the same Court. Thereby meaning a Judge.        of the appellate Court who is “completely free” to.    decide on what points he shall hear arguments if any    and that Third learned Judge is free to decide the    appeal by resolving the differences in the manner he    thinks proper.        ",
      "328. Mr Ajmalul Hossain, the learned    AGvosate appearing for the respondent-State as spe-    cial prosecutor, has referred to. us Chapter XXVII of    the CrPC which contains the provisions in respect of    the submissions of sentence for confirmation and    also Chapter XXXI under Part 7 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure which contains provisions of    eppeals arising out of the judgment and order of    cnminal Court. He has submitted that from the    scheme of the law Chapter XXVII of the Code con-    lains detailed provisions for submissions of the pro-    ceedings to the High Court Division when the Court    of Sessions passes the death sentence and the sen-    tence of death shall not be executed unless it is con-        firmed by the High Court Division, Referring to the    Scheme of the        mitted that by laying down the eave with thoi a        Jone Wefore the ‘Third learned Judge of the he    Court means appeal has to come to a linvality | Hi    High Court Division \\nlons WO Judes Hive t    eonsent and that the Third learned Judge jy ree ih    the expresalon “such hearing (iP any) ay he thin    tit refers to the situation where itis up to the 4    learned Judge's discretion to decide ag tg hoy ut    will hear the case as he thinks fit and that POstily,    that the Third Judge is completely free jp resolv    the decision as he thinks fit, In other Words i    Hossain has strived hard to argue that g¢    read with section 429 of the CrPC contem    it is for the Third Judge to decide on what Points p,,    shall hear the arguments if any, Accordingly, he has    asserted that there is no illegality in the Pinion py        nounced by the Third learned Judge in de    consider the case of the aforesaid six CONVict pep    sons about whom there was difference of Opinion    Without hearing the other convict appellants jp    detail. Chapter XXVII of the Code of Criming    Procedure provides for submission of sen    confirmation. Section 374 of the Code    that where the Sessions J udge passes the sentence      unless it is confirmed by the High Cour    Division. So it is mandatorily required to submit the    proceedings before the High Court Division for con.    firmation of death sentence, Section 377 of the Code    contemplates that the confirmation of sentence shall    be made and signed by at least two Judges of the    High Court Division. But when the Judges of the    High Court Division are equally divided in their    opinion, according to provision of section 378 of the    Code, “the case with their opinions thereon shall be    another Judge and such Judge after    such hearing as he thinks fit shall deliver his opinion    nent and order shall follow such opin-    1e scheme of the law it appears thal    XI under Part VII of the CrPC contains        ccused person convicted on a trial held |                      is a well established principles of law that once a    criminal appeal is admitted it must be decided on    verits and cannot be dismissed for non prosecution    yen if the appellant or his Advocate remains absent    in the Court at the time of hearing of the appeal, the    p ellate Court cannot avoid its responsibility or    uty from perusing the record of the case and giving    reasons in deciding the matter on merit. When the    rudges of the Divition Bench as the Court of appeal    e equally divided in opinion, ‘the case with their    opinions thereon shall be laid before another Judge”    of the same Court and such Judge after such hearing    ‘any as he thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and    the judgment and order shall follow such opinion.    From 2 careful reading of the provision of section    378 vis-a-vis section 429 of the Code it appears that    though the provisions in both these sections are    identical in nature, when the Judges of a Division    Bench are equally divided in their opinion yet sec-    tion 429 envisages that “the case, with their opinions    thereon shall be laid before another Judge of the    same Court and such Judge after such hearing (if    any) as he thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and the    judgment and order shall follow such opinion”.

",
      "326. He has argued that in case of split judg-    ment, the question of signing of the judgment by at    least two Judges as provided in section 377 is not    applicable in view of the decision of the case of    Babu vs State of UP reported in AIR 1963 SC 1467.    As regards power and jurisdiction of the Third    learned Judge the learned Attorney-General has    referred to the decision of the case of Sarat Chandra    Mitra vs Emperor reported in 15 CWN 18 = ILR 38    Cal 202, Ibrahim vs State reported in PLD 1959    (WP) Lahore 715, the case of Mahim Mondal vs    State reported in /5 DLR. 615, Sajjan Singh vs    Modhya Pradesh reported in AIR 1998 SC 2756 and    the unreported decision in our jurisdiction in the    case of State vs Md Foysal Alam Ansari and others    in Death Reference No.81 of 2003 with Criminal                      Appeal no this point the learned picid    ad uhert istons of superior Court.        ",
      "325. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned    Attorney-General, has also made identical submis-    sion like Mr Anisul Huq in respect of the scope and    jurisdiction of the Third learned Judge. He has sub-    mitted that when the Judges of a Division Bench are    equally divided in opinion and not concurrent the    provisions of sections 378 and 429 of the CrPC are    applicable, and accordingly, he referring to the pro-    visions of section 378 of the CrPC has submitted    that when the Judges of the Division Bench are    divided in their opinion, the case with their opinions    thereon shall be laid before another Judge of the    same Court and such Judge after such hearing as he    thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and the judgment    and order shall follow such opinion and thereby the    opinion of the Third learned Judge shall reach to its    finality becoming the judgment of the Court.        ",
      "324. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Advocate    sgring for the respondent-State, has referred to    ihe provisions of sections 377, 378 and 429 of the    pc and has submitted that the decided cases of    pangladesh, Pakistan and India demonstrate that the    Third learned Judge has been endowed with wide    giscretion to decide how to deal with the case and    that it is completely the Third learned Judge’s dis-    cretion as to how he will hear the case, (and in the    manner) as he thinks fit. He then submits that where    there are more than one accused in the case and the    jeamed Judges of the Division Bench are equally    divided on their opinion then the case of the accused    as to whom the Judges are equally divided on their    point shall be laid before the Third leamed Judge    and, on the other hand, when the learned Judges are    equally divided with regard to all the accuseds then    the whole case with regard to the accuseds is    referred to the Third learned Judge. In this context    Mr Hug has argued that the cases of the Sub-    Continent are divided into two groups, firstly, where    there are difference of opinion in respect of all the    accuseds and the cases where there are difference of    opinion either on evidence or on points of law relat-    ing to conviction or acquittal regarding some of the    accuseds. In this context Mr Huq has referred to the    decisions of the cases of Dharam Singh vs State of    UP reported in 1964 (1) CrLJ 78, Babu vs State of    UP reported in AIR 1965 SC 1467, Hethubha vs    State of Gujarat reported in AIR 1970 SC 1266,    Union of India vs BN Anantha Padma Nabiah    ported in AIR 1971 SC 1836, State of Andhra    Pradesh vs PT Appaiah reported in 147 AIR 198!

",

",
      "317. Since my learned brother has stated the    facts of this case in detail in his judgment and order,    I would not repeat the same. The above appeals have     arisen out of the gruesome and brutal murder of the    President and Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu    Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and members of his fami-    ly in the early hours of 15th August, 1975 at the offi-    cial residence of the then President at House    No.677, Road No.32, Dhanmondi, Dhaka.

      "860. In this    spamentous judgment concurring with the decision    nounced by my leared brother Md Tafazzul    jslam, J, I want to share my thoughts and views as    this case involves some vital questions of law hav-    ing far reaching consequences.        ",
      "313. God, the Almighty, likes and loves the    tolerant and crowns with success, A murderer is    always a murderer and a terrorist is always a terror    1st and is enemy to mankind and humanity and an    offender in the eye of law. To protect and shelter    such killers is a great crime, a great sin and sit    Spares none.        BK Das J: I agree with the judgment a    order delivered by my learned brother Md Tafazzul    Islam, J.

      "312. The arms of law is yet much more longer    and mighty than the devilish might and misdeeds of    the despotic and treacherous Government. |t is    revealed from the instant case that justice delayed is    not always (justice) denied but is available to the    endurance. We have high respect in the people of    this country who always held high against all odds,    the spirit of democracy and pursued through pain    and hardship to restore and retain democratic rights    and culture through democratic Government. We    believe that the people shall continue their role as    vanguard of democracy to make the Government    accountable,        ",
      "311. In the periphery of the instant Case, it j    indeed, difficult for us to address the submission, of    the learned Attorney-General, but we agree that; the    citizens of the Republic have the right to know ho»,    their hard earned money was being spent by the    Government and what was the authority of the    Government to protect, shelter and rehabilitate the    criminals instead of bringing them to face trial.

      "309. We are shockingly in dearth of proper    words to deprecate, condemn, disapprove and    denounce such treacherous, immoral and unautho-    rised activities of the beneficiary governments and    their misuse of Government machineries, No    bereaved family should be deprived of their right to    get justice nor should they move with pain, agony    and humiliation seeking justice for decades against    Government obstruction under the blanket of black    law nor any learned Judge should feel embarrass-    ment beyond their code of conduct to dispense jus-    tice being faithful to our oath, out of fear and favour.    Such activities of the Government are highly irre-    sponsible, regrettable, disgraceful and shameful not    only to the nation but also to the civilized commu-    nity of the world and lowered down the image of the    country internationally, We like to hope resolutely    and believe that neither the learned Judges 7    indulge to repeat their tarnishing role nop , i    heinous and nefarious acts at the Government    using Government power, authority and Jeg.)

      "308. Creating obstruction to get justice cre-    ates agitation among people ultimately creating law    and order situation. Delay in dispensing justice due    to embarrassment of learned Judges is also shameful    and at the same time disgraceful for the judiciary as    2 whole frustrating ends of justice and causing dis-    respect to the faith reposed by the people to the judi-    ciary, creating vicious atmosphere and impression to    shake and lose their confidence in judiciary leading    to devastating repercussion among them detrimental    to establish rule of law.

      "307. The above is, in a nutshell, the startling    picture of colossal erosion of human values, morals,    rights and liberties, Jaw and order and of justice    delivery system due to passing of the Indemnity    Ordinance, 1975, obstructing and depriving the een    stitutionally guaranteed right of the citizens to io    justice through due process of law, This is not on y    unheard of and unexpected to any civilised ae    but also inconceivable and unthinkable that ae    Government being bounded by and implementer a    the Constitution, being guardian of it's citizens    rights and liberties, law and order of the country,    instead of providing and helping its citizens getting    justice, protected, rehabilitated and harboured the    criminals by misusing the State machinery and the    hard toiled money of the citizens illegally and with-    out authority only to fulfill their personal interest    and imperial high ambition.

But after killing of    the President, General Ziaur Rahman hijacked the    constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties of    the citizens, justice delivery system totally failed    and collapsed after proclamation of the Indemnity    Ordinance, 1975 and the aggrieved persons failed to    secure justice by bringing the heinous offenders to    trial.

In Islam, death is the only    punishment for murder. Similar punishment has also    been provided in all other religions and under crim-        inal law with exception to transportation for life in    some circumstances.        ",

As it appears the principles laid down in    the above decisions are not applicable in the present    applying as the principles of due process of law as    applicable in a common law jurisdiction is not appli-    cable to our legal judicial system since we have    modified laws on the subject and (2) there are uni-    form decisions of our Superior Court that mere    nid is not a legal ground for commutation of a sen-    ence.        owing Pratt’s case and the principles applied in that    se iti    » accepted the petition and commuted the sen- 287, Accordingly I find that the accused per        tence ae - eee    poral death to imprisonment for life observing as SS including the appellants in a planned mannet    committed the heinous crime with their knowledg¢        of the consequences and therefore, they do    deserve any special sympathy in awarding the se™    tence. Therefore, I find no merit in these appeals 2\"        “They therefore reviewed    Or the relevant con-    siderations, at pp. 34-35, and concluded that in                          accordingly, the appeals are dismissed with Modifi    ation as stated earlier.

In Guerra’ case the Privy Councij fa    lowed the principles taken in Pratt's case observeg        as follows:        “Where a person was sentenced to death in    a common law jurisdiction, execution y,,.    required to be carried out by the state as SWifily    as practicable after sentence, allowing a reason.    able time for appeal and consideration o¢    reprieve, since under the common law a long.    delayed execution was not in accordance y ith    the due process of law. In Trinidad and Tobay,    such an execution, if not stayed, would consi.    tute a cruel and unusual punishment contrary to    section 5(2)(b) of the Constitution and would    not be in accordance with the due process of    law under section 4(a) of the Constitution.” |)    thus appears that the principles laid down in the    above decisions are not applicable in the pres-    ent case, applying the principles of due process    of law as applicable in a common law jurisdic-    tion is not applicable to our legal judicial sys-    tem since we have codified laws on the subject    and (2) there are uniform decisions of our    Superior Court that mere delay is not a legal    ground for commutation of a sentence.

In Pratt’s case referred in Mr Mamun it    appears the rules in force in Jamaica laid down a    strict timetable for appeals to the Judicial    Committee of the Privy Council and further provid-    ed that execution would only be stayed so long as    the timetable was adhered to, There were also cer-    tain other pleas that were raised. The Privy Council    accepted their plea and commuted their sentence to    imprisonment for life on the following reasons:        “prolonged delay in carrying out a sentence    of death after that sentence had been passed    could amount to inhuman......... punishment or    other treatment contrary to section 17(1) of the    Jamaican Constitution irrespective of whether    the delay was caused by the shortcomings of the    state or the Jegitimate resort of the accused to    all available appellate procedures. A state that    wished to retain capital punishment had to    accept the responsibility of ensuring that execu-    tion followed as swiftly as practicable after sen-    tence, allowing a reasonable time for appeal    and consideration of reprieve and, if the appel-    late procedure enabled the prisoner to prolong    the appellate hearings over a period of years,    the fault was to be attributed to the appellate    system that permitted such delay and not to the    prisoner who took advantage of it.”                ",

In Machhi Singh’s case (supra) the    Supreme Court of India, after classifying the cases    in which death penalty may be imposed, calculated    as follows:                      When the victim of murder is (a) an inno-    cent child who could not have or has not pro-    vided even an eXcUse, much less a provocation,    for murder (b) a helpless woman OF a person    rendered helpless by old age or infirmity (c)    when the victim is a person vis-a-vis whom the    r is in a position of domination of trust    (d) when the victim is a public figure generally    loved and respected by the community for the    services rendered by him and the murder 18    committed for political or similar reasons other        than personal reasons.”                ",
      "973. The Supreme Court of India maintained the    conviction of death sentence of Kehar Singh and    Satwant Singh. Ozha J observed as follows:        “Then is the question of sentence which    was argued to some extent. But it must be clear-    ly understood that it is not a case where X is    killed by Y on some personal ground for per-    sonal vendetta. The person killed is a lady and    no less than the Prime Minister of this country    who was the elected leader of the people. In our    country we have adopted and accepted a system    wherein change of the leader is permissible by    ballot and not by bullet. The act of the accused    not only takes away the life of popular leader    but also undermines our system which has been    working so well for the last forty years. There is    yet another serious consideration. Beant Singh    and Satwant Singh are persons who were post-    ed on the security duty of the Prime Minister.    They are posted there is protect her from any    intruder or from any attack from outside and    therefore if they themselves resort to this kind    of offence, there appears to be no reason or no    mitigating circumstance for consideration on    the question of sentence. Additionally, an    unarmed lady was attacked by these two per-    sons with a series of bullets and it has found    that a number of bullets entered her body. The    manner in which mercilessly she was attacked    by these 2 persons on whom the confidence was    reposed to give her protection repels any con-    sideration of reduction of sentence. In this view    of the matter, even the conspirator who inspired    the persons who actually acted does not deserve    any leniency in the matter of sentence. In our    opinion, the sentence awarded by the trial    COURT and maintained by the High Court    appears to be just and proper.”        ",
      "281. In the Indira Gandhi killing case being    Kehar Singh vs State, AIR 1988 SC 1883 similar    question was raised about the extreme sentence of    death in the context of section 354(3) of the Code of    1",
      "280. In the case of Rajiv Gandhi the, ex-Prime    Minister of India, the Supreme Court of India while                      maintaining of death sentence in accordance with    section 354(3) of the Code in the case of Nalini    (1999 3 SCC 253).        DP Wadhwa, J observed as :        “Cruelty of the crime committed has    known no bounds. The crime sent shock waves    in the country. General elections had to be post-    poned. It was submitted more than once that    principal perpetrators in the present case are    already dead but then for the support which    Nalini (A-1), Santhan (A-2), Murugan (A-3) and    Arivu (A-18) afforded for commission of the    crime it could not have been committed. Each    one of these four accused had a role to play.    Crime was committed after previous planning    and executed with extreme brutality. There were    as many as two dry runs as to how to reach Rajiv    Gandhi after penetrating the security cordon. A    former Prime Minister of the country was target-    ed because this country had entered an agree-    ment with a foreign country in exercise of its    sovereign powers. Rajiv Gandhi being the head    of the Government at that time was signatory to    the accord which was also signed by the head of    the Government of Sri Lanka. The Accord had    the approval of Parliament. It was not that Rajiv    Gandhi had entered into the Accord in his per-    sonal capacity or for his own benefit. Though we    have held that object of the conspiracy was not to    commit any terrorist act or any disruptive activi-    ty, nevertheless murder of a former Prime    Minister for what he did in the interest of the    country was an act of exceptional depravity on    the part of the accused, an unparalleled act in the    annals of crimes committed in this country. In a    mindless fashion not only was Rajiv Gandhi    killed but along with him others died and many    suffered grievous and simple injuries. It is not    that intensity of the belt bomb strapped on the    waist of Dhanu was not known to the conspira-        tors as after switching on the first switch on her    belt bomb Dhanu asked Sivarasan to move away.    Haribabu was so keen to have close-up pictures    of the crime that he met his fate in the blast itself.    We are unable to find any mitigating circum-    stance not (sic) to upset the award of sentence of    death on the accused.”            ",
      "279. In Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab, 4     7980 SC &98 Bachan Singh was convicted and Sen.    tenced to death under section 302 for murder o¢    three persons. His sentence of death was confirm, -    by the Punjab High Court. His appeal by Special    Leave came up for hearing before a Division Benchan,    The leave was granted to consider whether the fac;    found by the Courts below would be ‘special rea-    sons’ for awarding the death sentence as requirement    under section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal    Procedure 1973”. The Division Bench of the    Supreme Court referred the matter to 2    Constitutional Bench for a decision in regard to the    constitutional validity of death penalty for murders    provided in section 302 and the sentencing proce-    dure embodied in section 334(3) of the Code. The    Supreme Court by a majority maintained the sen-    tence of death observing as follows:        “Attuned to the legislative policy delineat-    ed in sections 354(3) and 235(2) propositions    (iv)(a) and (v) (b) in Jagmohan, shall have to be    recast and may be stated as below:        (a) The normal rule is that the offences of    murder shall be punished with the sentence of    life imprisonment. The Court can depart from    that rule and impose the sentence of death only    if there are special reasons for doing so. Such    reasons must be recorded in writing before    imposing the death sentence. (b) While consid-    ering the question of sentence to be imposed for    the offence of murder under section 302, Pen!    Code, the Court must have regard to every    evant circumstance relating to the crime as well    as the criminal. If the Court finds, but not oth-    erwise, that the offence is of an exceptionally    depraved and heinous character and constitutes    on account of its design and the manner of its    execution, a source of grave danger to the So    ety at large, the Court may impose the deat    sentence.”        ",
      "278. Under this new provision life sentence is    now the rule and it is only in exceptional cases, for    special reasons to be assigned the death sentence    can be imposed. In the case of Jogmohan Singh vs    State of UP AIR 1973 SC 947 it has been observed    as follows:        “A large number of murders is undoubted-    ly of common type. But some at least are dia-    bolical in conception and cruel in execution. In    some other’s where the victim is a person of    high standing in the country society is liable to    be rocked to its very foundation. Such murders    cannot simply be whisked away by finding ali-    bis in the social maladjustment of the murderer    of such crimes speaks. in Opinion     he inevitability of death panel.        ",
      "973. The correspondent    been reemactec        is provided in section 354(3) which        Section 354(3) When the conviction is for    2 sentence punishable with death or, in the alter-    native, with imprisonment for life or imprison-    ment for 2 term of years, the judgment shall    state the reasons for the sentence awarded, and,    in case of sentence of death, the special reason    for such sentence”.        ",
      "277. As it appears in India section 367(5) has    mite    2 in the Code of 1",
      "276.  The result of this amendment is that it was left to the discretion of the Court on the facts of each to pass a sentence of death or a lesser sentence. The Appellate Division in the case of Abul Khair vs State 44 DLR (AD) 225 held that delay itself is no extenuating circumstances to commute the sentence. The observations are as under:                  \"Delay by itself in the execution of sentence of deatrh is by no means an extenuating circumtances for commuting the sentence of death to imprisonment for life. There must be other circumtances of a compelling nature which together with delay will merit such commutation. We find no compelling extenauting circumtances in this case and therefore, find no ground whatsoever to interfere.”        ",
      "275. This shows that the imposition of death    sentence was the rule and the awarding of a lesser    sentence was an exception-discretion was directed    towards death penalty. This provision was however    substituted by Ordinance No.XLIX of 1978 with    effect from 1979 as follows:        “Section 367(5) provides that “if the    accused is convicted of an offence punishable                              ",
      "274. Originally sub-section (5) of or section    367 provided as follows:    <br>    “If the accused is convicted of an offence    punishable with death, and the Court sentenced    him to any punishment other than death, the    Court shall in its judgment state the reasons    why sentence of death was not passed.”        ",
      "273. In order to satisfy ourselves we have    called for the records of the High Court Division    and perused the order sheet. We noticed that the    appellants never made any endeavour to dispose of    the appeals either in the High Court Division or in    the Appellate Division. It was the State that fre-    quently prayed for fixation of the death reference in    the High Court Division and on its prayer a Bench    Was constituted for hearing the death reference.    After the death reference was disposed of by the    High Court Division, the appellants after filing leave    petitions did not take any step for hearing of their    petitions. It was only on the prayer of the State that    the leave petitions were heard and the appeals were    also heard. Over and above, the appellant Md Bazlul    Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) remained in abscon-    sion in course of the trial of the case and at the time    of hearing of the death reference Mohiuddin    (Lancer), after many years, filed leave petitions with    a prayer for condonation of delay . The delay, in the    premises, was not due to the laches on the part of the    State. Since the condemned prisoners did not take    any steps for hearing of the death reference and their    appeals at any point of time, so they are not entitled    to submit that by reason of their detention in con-    demned cell they have been subjected to “torture or    to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treat-    ment. Further they also did not raise this point at any    point of time, rather from their conduct it is appar-    ent that they have tried to delay the disposal of the        appeal.        ",
      "272. Mr Anisul Hug however contended that    the appellants deserved extreme sentence since they    not only brutally killed the President of the country    who was also Father of the Nation but killed 3    “omen and a child and by their act they committed    “ime against humanity they also extinguished the    pedigree of the First Family in the country and they    did the same act with motive that nobody could take    any legal action in future against them. Accordingly    when the murder is committed in such extremely    wal and grotesque, diabolical, manner and when    Wome, of murder is an innocent child or a helpless    repect whom or a public figure generally loved and    proper ed by the community extreme sentence Is the    4s refs In this connection, the learned Counsel    Minh, tr the case of Machhi Singh vs State of        (1983) 3 Supreme Court Cases 470.            ",
      "271. Learned Attorney-General contends that    tae delay in concluding hearing of the appeal is not    dye to the laches of the State but it is in fact for the    latches of the accused appellants and further the    eccused persons including the appellants in a plan-    ned manner committed the heinous crime with their    knowledge of the consequences and therefore, they    do not deserve any special sympathy in awarding    the sentence.        ",
      "270. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun = the learned    scl, submitted that the appellants have been in    i] for a long time, this prolonged delay in    aving out a sentence of death after their sentence    ; j been passed amounts to inhuman punishment    ; torture and violative of fundamental rights    \" anteed in Article 35(5) of the Constitution, inas-    at 3s under this provision provided that no per-    yall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman    sy parading punishment or treatment and so in    view of the principle laid down in the case of Pratt    s 4norney-General for Jamaica, (1993) 4 All ER    Henfield vs Attorney-General of    Common wealth of Bahamas, 3 WIR (PC) 1079 and    Guerra vs Baptiste (1995) 4 All ER 583, sentence of    jeath awarded to these appellants is liable to be    commuted to imprisonment for life, so sentence of    geath awarded to these appellants is liable to be        commuted to imprisonment for life.                ",
      "269. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned    Counsel, in this contention, referred a decision in                      ",
      "268. Their convictions are modified accord-    ingly. The leaned Counsel of the appellants raising    the point of commuting of sentence submitted that    since the appellants have been in the death cell fora    long period, even this Division finds that the learned    Judges of the High Court Division have rightly    found the charges leveled against them, ends of jus-    tice demands that the sentence awarded to the appellants be reduced to imprisonment for life.        ",
      "267. But however, in view of the discussion    made above, I am of the view that the legal convic-    tion of the appellants Farook Rahman, Mohiuddin    (Artillery), Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) and Bazlul    Huda should have been under section 302 read with    section 120B and section 34 of the Penal Code    instead of 302/34 of the Penal Code and the legal    conviction of Sultan Shahriar should have been    under sections 302/120B of the Penal Code.        ",
      "266. Accordingly, the appellants were duly    convicted under section 120B as well. On overal|    consideration of the evidence and the laws applica.    ble in this case I am of the view that the High Court    Division is justified in arriving at the conclu- sion    that the appellants and other accuseds hatched up    conspiracy to kill the President the members of his    family present in the house, and accomplished their    object by killing them and other three security per-    sonnel.                ",
      "265. Later on in the case of the State of    Andhra Pradesh vs Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao    AIR. 1963 SC 1850 it has been observed:        “The offence of conspiracy is an entirely    independent offence and though other offences    are committed in pursuance of the conspiracy    the liability of the conspirators for the conspi-    racy itself cannot disappear. In the Indian Penal    Code, as originally enacted, conspiracy was not    an offence. Section 120B, which makes crimi-    nal conspiracy punishable, was added by the    Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1913    (VIII of 1913) along with section 120A. Section    120A defines conspiracy and section 120B pro-    vides for the punishment for the offence of con-    spiracy. Criminal conspiracy as defined in sec-    tion 120A consists of an agreement to do an    illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is    not illegal by illegal means, Section 120B pro-    vides that whoever is a party to a conspiracy to    commit an offence punishable with death,    imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment    for a term of two years or upwards shall be pun-    ishable in the same manner as if he has abetted    such offence unless there was an express provi-    sion in the Code for the punish- ment of such    conspiracy. Criminal conspiracy was, however,    not an unknown thing before the amendment of    the Indian Penal Code in 1913 . But what the    amendment did was to make that conspiracy    itself punishable. The idea was to prevent, the    commission of crimes by, so to speak, nippy; e    them in the bud. But it does not follow ,        where crimes have been committed the liabitiy    to punishment already incurred under Section    120B by having entered into a criminal Conspip.    acy is thereby wiped away. No doubt, as alrea d        stated, where offences for committing Which ;    conspiracy was entered into have actually been    committed it may not, in the particular circum,    stances of a case, be desirable to charge the    offender both with the conspiracy and the    offences committed in pursuance of that con.    spiracy. But that would be a matter ultimately    within the discretion of the Court before which        the trial takes place.”        ",
      "264. Inthe case of State of Ahdhra Pradesh vs    Kandimalla Subbaiah AIR 1961 SC 1241 the point    for consideration was whether an offence is said to    have been committed in consequence of abetment,    when it has been committed in pursuance of the con-    spiracy, and the abettor by conspiracy can be made    punishable with the punishment provided for the    actual offence. The Supreme Court replied to the    point as under:    <br>                  “Conspiracy to commit an offence is itself    an offence and a person can be separately    charged within respect to such a conspiracy.    There is no analogy between section 120B and    section 109 IPC There may be an element of    abetment in a conspiracy; but conspiracy is    something more than an abetment. Offences    created by sections 109 and 120B, IPC are quite    distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the    one element of conspiracy,    prosecution to only consation is that        that is, abetment when the allegal    what a person did was something over and    above that. Where a number of offences are    committed by several persons in pursuance ofa    conspiracy it is usual to charge them with those    offences as well as with the offence of conspi-        racy to commit those offence.”        ",
      "263. In the case of Noor Mohammad Mohol    Yusuf Momin (Supra) the distinctive features of sec-        tions 34, 107 and 120B have been explained as fol-    lows:      <br>  “So far as section 34, Indian Penal Code is    concerned, it embodies the principle of joint lia-    bility in the doing of a criminal act, the essence    of that liability being the existence of a com-    mon intention. Participation in the commis-    sion of the offence in furtherance of the com-    mon intention invites its application, Section    109 . Indian Penal Code, on the other hand, may    be attracted even if the abettor is not present    when the offence abetted is committed provid-    ed that he has instigated the commission of the    offence or has engaged with one or more other        Persons in a conspiracy to commit an offence            and pursuant to that conspiracy some act or    illegal omission takes place or has intentionally    aided the commission of an offence by an act or    illegal omission. Turning to the charge under    section 120B. Indian Penal Code, criminal con-    spiracy was made a substantive offence in 1913    by the introduction of chapter V-A in the Indian    Penal Code. Criminal conspiracy postu- lates an    agreement between two or more per- sons to do,    or cause to be done, an illegal act or an act    which is not illegal, by illegal means. It differs    from other offences in that mere agreement ts    made an offence even if no step is taken to carry    out that agreement. Though there is close asso-    ciation of conspiracy with incite- ment and    abetment the substantive offence of criminal    conspiracy is somewhat wider in am- plitude    than abetment by conspiracy as contem- plated    its very nature is generally hatched in secret. It    is, therefore, extremely rare that direct evidence    in proof of conspiracy can be forth- coming    from wholly disinterested quarters or from utter    strangers. But, like other offences, criminal    conspiracy can be proved by circum- stantial    evidence. In- deed, in most cases proof of con-    spiracy is largely inferential though the infer-    ence must be founded on solid facts. Sur-    rounding circumstances and antecedent and    subsequent conduct, among other factors, cons-    titute relevant material. In fact, because of the    difficulties in having direct evidence of crimi-    nal conspiracy, once reasonable ground is    shown for believing that two or more persons    have conspired to commit an offence then any-    thing, done by anyone of them in reference to    their common intention after the same is enter-    tained becomes, according to the law of evi-    dence, relevant for proving both conspiracy and    the offences ‘committed pursuant thereto. ”        ",
      "262. Sub-section (1) of section 120B imposes    a penalty equal to the punishment for abetment on    articipation in criminal conspiracy to commit an    offence: The section appears to have been intro-    guced 10 fill up the gap in section 107 defining    gbetment. Under section 107 “secondly” provides    that a person abets the doing of a thing who engages    with others in a conspiracy for doing of that thing if    an act OT illegal omission takes place in pursuance of    that conspiracy. Abetment of an offence is punish-    able under sections 109 and 116 as the case may be,    if the offence is not committed; but it is clear that a    conspiracy will not amount to an abet- ment unless    anact or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of    the conspiracy. Therefore, the first class of cases    which section 120B is designed to cover, is that in    which the conspiracy is formed for the commission to    a serious offence. But no act or illegal omission has    taken place in present appeals. Section 120A provides    the extended definition of criminal conspiracy cover-    ing acts which do not amount to abetment by con-    spiracy within the meaning of section 107; Section    120B provides punishment for criminal conspiracy    where no express provision is made in the Penal Code    for the punishment of such conspiracy.        ",
      "261. As it appears that there is no substantial    difference between conspiracy as defined in section    120A and acting on a common intention as conte”    plated in section 34 . In the former the gist for the    offence is bare agreement and association to break    law even though illegal act does not follow while    the gist of an offence under.section 34 is the commision                      mission of a criminal act in furtherance of a com-    mon intention of all the offenders which means that    there should be a unity of criminal behaviour result-    ‘ag in something for which an individual will be    punishable if it is done by himself alone,        ",
      "259. In Hazrat Ali's case, the Appellate Divi-    sion on assessment of the evidence on record came    to the conclusion that Hazrat Ali abetted the offence    of murder of Zahura Khatun and accordingly con-    verted his conviction to 302/109 from an offence of    302/34,        260, In Dharam Pal’s case, it was observed    that the existence or otherwise of the common inten-    tion depends upon the facts and circumstances of    each case, and in the absence of materials, “the com-    panion or companions cannot justifiably be held    guilty for every offence committed by the principal    offender.” The facts of the above cases are quite dis-    tinguishable from the present case.        ",
      "258. Regarding the submission that conviction     of the charge of conspiracy could not be Liven    after the conspiracy has borne fruit, as it appears in    Shamsul Hoque’ case, following the case reportey    in AIR 1938 Mad 130 which was also followed in 4    DLR 48, it was observed that where an offence is    alleged to have been committed by two or more per.    sons, the person responsible for commission of the    offence should be charged with the substantive    offence, while the persons alleged to have abetted it    by conspiracy should be charged with the offence of    abetment under section 109 . As it appears views    taken in AJR 1938 Mad 130 which was follows in g    DLR 48 have been overruled in Kandimally    Subbaiah's case (AIR 1961 SC 1241 (paras 7 and 8),    The facts and the principles of law involved in Amar    Kumar Thakur s case are quite distinguishable since    the offence charged against the accused is under sec-    tions 302/34, in which, this Court found no legal    evidence that the “appellants No.2-4 had any inten-    tion of their own to cause the death of Nandalal, par-    ticularly when he was proceeding at their request to    hold the mediation at that hour of the night.”        ",
      "257. The above decision discussed the prin-    ciples of joint liability, mere distance from the scene    of crime cannot exclude culpability under section 34    of the Penal Code in criminal sharing making out a    certain measure of jointness in the commission of    the act. However the learned Judges of the High    Court Division failed to appreciate the ratio deci-    dendi of the above decisions regarding the presence    of appellant, Sultan Shahriar, | am accord- ingly of    the view that the prosecution is required to prove the    Presence of Sultan Shahriar and his Parti- cipation in    the commission of the offence in fur- therance of the    common intention of all in order to bring his offence    within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal Code buy    failed,        ",
      "256. And this is the role of accused No.2 according to the Courts below. Could this legal interface be altogether untenable?        ",
      "255. The application of section 34 in respect    of the offences other than physical violence have    been explained in Tukaram Ganpats case (supra)    wherein the facts against the accused including the    appellant Tukaram were that they stole some bun-    dles of copper wire from the godown of a company    after breaking open the godown and removed them    by a lorry which stopped at a weigh-bridge Where    the brokers for sale were present, There was no evi-    dence about the presence of the appellant at the    scene of offence. The concurrent findings of the    Courts below were that the appellant was in posses-    sion of duplicate keys of the burgled godown found    missing from the factory and that he was present at    the weigh bridge. The appellant had no explanation    for possessing of godown keys nor for his presence    at weigh-bridge. In the context of the matter me    Supreme Court maintained the conviction of the                      appellant on applying the principles of common    intention as under:    “Mere distance from the scene of crime    cannot exclude culpability under section 34    which laws down the rule of joint responsibility    for a criminal act performed by a plurality of    persons. In Barendra Kumar Ghosh vs King    Emperor (1924) 52 JA 40-(AIR 1925 PC 1) the    Judicial Committee drew into the criminal net    thase ‘who only stand and wait.’. This does not    mean that some form of presence, near or    remote, is not necessary, or that mere presence    without more, at the spot of crime, spells culpa-    bility . Criminal sharing, overt or covert, by    active presence or by distant direction, making    out a certain measure of jointness in the com-    mission of the act is the essence of section 34.    Even assuming that presence at the scene is a    pre-requisite to attract section 34 and that such    propinguity is absent. section 107 which is dif-    ferent in one sense, still comes into play to rope    in the accused. The act here is not the picking    the godown Jock but housebreaking and crimi-    nal house trespass. This crime is partici- pated    in by those operating by remote control as by    those doing physical removal.. Together operat-    ing in concert, the criminal project is executed.    Those who supply the duplicate key, wait at the    weigh bridge for the break-in and bringing of    the booty and later secrete the keys are par-    ticipes criminil,        ",
      "254. In the case of Noor Mohammad Md    Yusuf Momin vs State of Maharashtra (supra), the    trial Court convicted Md Taki Haji Hussain Momin    under section 302 and acquitted three other accused    including the appellant. On appeal against acquittal,    the Bombay High Court reversed the acquittal and    convicted the appellant and two others under sec-    tions 120B and 302 read with section 34, IPC. The    appellant was also convicted under sections    302/109, IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life    on two counts separately. The appellant’s conviction    under sections 302/34, IPC was set aside on the fol-    lowing observations:        “From the evidence it seems highly prob-    able that at the time of the actual murder of    Mohd. Yahiya the appellant was either present    with other three co-accused or was somewhere    nearby. But this evidence does not seem to be    enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt his    presence at the spot in the company of the other    accused when the murder was actually commit-    ted ..... we are, therefore, inclined to give to the    appellant the benefit of doubt in regard to the    charge under section 302 read with section 34,    IPC.”        ",
      "253. In Tajul Islam’s case (supra) the High    Court Division noticed the evidence produced by    the prosecution in support of charge that Badsha in    his confession stated that he pressed the legs of sec:    ond son of Biroja Rani, and accused Inu cut him into    two pieces by a dao. Other confessing accused stat-    ed that for the purpose of committing the offence    they went to the house of Biroja and were on guard    either in the boat or in front of the door of neigh-    bours of Biroja or on the road leading to the house    of Biroja presumably to prevent any person from    coming in the way of their committing the offence.    In the facts of the case the learned Judges observed    as follows:        “In offence involving physical viol    normally presence at the scene of the 0    tence of the offender sought to be rend    liable on the principle of joint liability ness-    sary; such is not the case in respect of other    offences where offence consists of adverse acts    Which may be done at a different time and    place.”        ",
      "252. In the case of Rasool Bux vs State 22    pLR (SC) 297 the Supreme Court of Pakistan    roved the views taken in the case of Barendra    St Ghosh and considered the case in the light of    observations made by their Lordships of the    a Council. In that case accused Lal Bux and    asul Bux planned to abduct Mst. Roshna from the    pouse of her father, if necessary, by the use of force.    They were both armed with deadly weapons. When    their presence was discovered in the Courtyard they    gbandoned their original plan but were nevertheless    getermined to escape, if necessary, by use of    weapons carried by them. It was observed this    “common intention though originally not present    wes formed at the spur of the moment when they    found themselves being surrounded by persons    attracted to the place.......... ”. Lal Bux fired at the    person Who was ahead of those coming to prevent    their escape and Rasul Bux also fired two shots . It    was further observed that they “fired with the com-    mon intention of preventing the interceptors from    cutting of their escape. It is difficult, therefore, to    appreciate how it can be said that they were not act-    ing in furtherance of the common intention of them    both.”        ",
      "251. In the case of Sreekantiah (supra) it was    observed :        “The essence of section 34 that the person    must be physically present at the scene of occur-    rence coupled with actual participation which,    of course, can be of a passive character such as    standing by a door, provided that is done with    the intention of assisting in furtherance of com-    mon intention of them all and there is a readi-    ness to play his part in the prearranged plan    when the time comes for him to act”. A five-    member Bench of this Court also took similar    view in Abdur Rahman Mondal’s case (supra)    as follows :        “The common intention to bring about a    particular result may well develop on the spot    as between a number of persons. All that is    necessary is either to have direct proof of prior co”    cert or proof of circumstances which necessarily    ily lead to that inference or the incriminating    acts must be incompatible with the innocence .    the accused and incapable of explanation on                      any other reasonable hypothesis. Further, it is    the essence of section 34 that the person must    be physically present at the actual commission    of the crime.”        ",
      "250. In the case of Ramaswami (supra) it has    been observed, section 34 is to be read along with    the preceding section 33 which makes it clear that    the “act” spoken of in section 34 includes a series of    acts as a single act. It follows that the words “when    a criminal act is done by several persons”. So sec-    tion 34, may be construed to mean “when criminal    acts are done by several persons.” The acts com,    mitted by different confederates in the Criminal    action may be different but all must in one way o,    the other participate and engage in the criminal    enterprise. For instance, one may only stand guard    to prevent any person coming to the relief of the Vic-    tim or to otherwise facilitate the execution of the    common design. Such a person also commits ap    “act” as much as his co-participants actually commit.    ting the planned crime. In the case of an offence    involving physical violence, however, it is essential    for the application of section 34 that the person who    instigates or aids the commission of the crime must,    be physically present at the actual commission of    the crime for the purpose of facilitating or prompt.    ting the offence, the commission of which is the aim    of the joint criminal venture. Such presence of those    who in one way or the other facilitate the execution    of the common design, is itself tantamount to actual    participation in the ‘criminal act.’ The essence of    section 34 is simultaneous consensus of the minds    of persons participating in the criminal action to    bring about a particular result. Such consensus can    also be developed at the spot and thereby intended    by all of them.        ",
      "249. Therefore, the dominant feature of sec-    tion 34 is the element of participation in action, this    participation need not be in all cases by physical    presence. The Supreme Court of India has distin-    guished the cases in which the physical presence of    the accused person at the place of incident is pre-    requisite and in which cases the physical presence of    the accused was not necessary-his participation by    doing separate acts similar or diverse would bring    him within the ambit of the section .        ",
      "248. In Barendra, Kumar Ghosh 5.,.case,    (supra) their Lordships of the Privy Council have    clearly expounded the principles animated in the.    section. In that case three men fired at the post mas-    ter, of whom Barendra Kumar, the appellant, was    one. He wore distinctive clothes by which he could    be and was identified; and while these men were just    inside the room, another was visible from the room    through the door standing close to the others but just    outside on the doorstep in the Court- yard. This man    was armed but did not fire. The defence of Barendra    was that he was the man outside the room, that he    stood in the Courtyard and was very much fright-    ened, Whether he was present as one of the firing    party or as its commander or as its reserve or its sen-    tinel was of no special importance on the case made    for the Crown. Why he was there at all and why he    did not take himself off again he did not say, nor did                      he even indicate his precise position in the yard,    Their Lordships while maintaining the conviction of    Barendra expounded the ambit of section 34 as fol-    lows :        “Ry section 33 a criminal act in section 34    includes a series of acts and, further “act    includes omission to act, for example, an omis-    sion to interfere in order to prevent a murder    being done before one’s very eyes. By section    37, when any offence is committed by means of    several acts Whoever intentionally cooperates in    the commission of that offence by doing any    one of those acts, either singly or jointly with    any other person, commits that offence. Even if    the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the    door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in    other things “they also serve who only stand    and wait.” By section 38 when several persons    are engaged or concerned in the commission of    a criminal act, they may be guilty of different    offences by means of that act. Read together,    these sections are reasonably plain. Section 34    deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or    diverse by several persons; if all are done in fur-    therance of a common intention, each person is    liable for the result of them all, as ifhe had done    them himself for “that act” and “the act” in the    latter part of the section must include the whole    action covered by “a criminal act” in the first    part, because they refer to it.”        ",
      "247. As observed earlier, the dominant feature    of section 34 of the Penal Code is the element of    participation is actions. This participation need not    in all cases be by physical presence. Common inten-    tion implies acting in concert. This section requires    that there must be a general intention shared by all    the persons united with a common pur- pose to do    any criminal offence, all of those who assist in the    accomplishment of the object would be equally    guilty. It follows, therefore, that common intention    is an intention to commit a crime actually commit-    ted and every one of the accused should have par-    ticipated in that infention.        ",
      "246. Regarding Sultan Shahriar, admittedly    he was not present at the place of occurrence and he    was deployed at the Radio Station from before the    time of occurrence. As stated earlier, his task was    also to prevent anyone from seeking help through    the Radio Station. So question arises whether his act    falls within the ambit of section 34 since he was not    physically present at the place of occurrence? The    leamed Judges of the High Court Division were of    the view that he shared the common intention with    other accused persons, although his participation    Was Not active, it was passive, which act also fell    Within the ambit of section 34 . The first learned    Tudge observed that besides being present at the    night parade, his presence at the Radio Station was    part of the said agreement that he entered into agree-    ment with other convicts for the purpose of causing    the incident in the house of the President. The sec-    ond learned Judge also noticed his presence at the    Radio Station about 4-30/5-00 AM and expressed    similar views. The learned Judges considered the    cases of Barendra Kumar Ghose vs Emperor, AIR    1925 (PC) 1, Shreekantiah Ramayya Muni Palli, vs    State of Bombay AIR 1955 SC 287, Tukaram    Gonapat vs State of Maharashtra AIR 1974 SC 5] 4,    Ramaswami vs State of TN AIR 1976 SC 2027,    Abdur Rahman Mandol vs State, 29 DLR (SC) 247,    Bangladesh vs Abed Ali, 36 DLR (AD) 234, Abdus    Samad vs State 44 DLR (AD) 233 and State vs Tajul    Islam 48 DLR 305 in coming to their conclusion.        ",
      "245. The records show that Mohiuddin (Artillery    ) was deputed with cannon at Kalabagan play-    ler? nd near Road No, 32, Sultan Shahriar was    gt\" ad at the Radio Station, Farook Rahman came    7 ; Rakhibahini Headquarter to the house of the    In gent, Mohiuddin (Lancer), Bazlul Huda and    hie other officers were given the main task of    ementing the main object of killing the Presi-    t and the members of his family, The movement    den appellants with arms and cannons at different    of the sints was a part of the criminal conspiracy to    vit Pe common design of killing the President    his family members Without any interruption.    qzlur Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) actively par-    jpated in the killing. Farook Rahman as it appears    though did not join in the Killing but his presence    near the house of the President with a tank at the    ‘me of killing was in furtherance of common inten-    tion of all of them to implement the act and with that    end in view to resist others to come in the way of    implementing their ultimate goal and though his    participation was passive and diverse but he was    resent at or about the place of occurrence. Mohi-    yddin (Artillery) aided co-accuseds Bazlul Huda,    Mohiuddin (Lancer) and others by way of guarding    the house of the President with his troops and can-    non from Kalabagan playground with the motive    that if force come forward to rescue the President he    would resist them, and with that object he fired four    cannon balls letting others to know that he was pre-    pared to use the cannon-balls. Thus, actions of    Faruque Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) come    within the ambit of section 34 as they were ready to    participate in the crime in case of necessity.            ",
      "244. As stated earlier, the appellants attended    the night parade, and it was organised to fulfil and    implement their object. The appellants and other    accuseds deployed jawans under the command of    officers at key points such as, Rakhibahini Head-    quarter, BDR Headquarter, Radio Station, Minto    Road. and Road No. 32 .This deployment of army at    Rakhibahini Headquarter and BDR Headquarter    was a part of their pre-plan to prevent these para-    military forces to come forward to protect the    President in case of any information or help was    sought for, The deployment at the Radio Station was    for preventing any person on behalf of the Gover    ment to seek any help from the army, navy, air force.    paramilitary forces, political activists or from other    sources. The deployment at Minto Road was also !0    prevent the Ministers to mobilise the public or any    other force for the protection of the President.                      ",
      "243. Now the question is, what will be result    if the above principles are applied to the facts of the    present appeals?        ",
      "242. A criminal intention within the Meaning    of section 34 is simultaneous conscientiousness of    minds of persons participating in the criminal action    to bring such particular result and if one facilitates    the execution of the common design such Person    commits an act as much as his CO-participants    actually committing the planned crime. The essence    of section is that the person must be Physically    present at the actual commission of the crime. This    must be coupled with actual participation, which    may be of passive character such as standing by a    door or near about the incident with the intention of    assisting in furtherance of common intention of all    the accused and with a readiness to play his pant    when the time comes for him to act.        ",
      "241.         Following illustrations will clear the    point :      <br>      A attacks Z under such circumstances, 5    grave provocation that his killing of Z Would    only culpable homicidal not amounting to mu.    der. B having ill-will towards Z and intendint    to kill him, and not having been subject to the    provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though    A and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death    B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of    culpable homicide.        ",
      "240. A reading of these provision shows that    sections 34 and 35 create responsibility for the total    result while section 38 creates individual responsi-    bility only. Section 34 applies where there is a com-    mon intention and for a criminal act done in further-    ance of common intention of all, everyone is equally    responsible. Section 35 requires the existence of the    knowledge or intent in each accused before he can    be held liable if knowledge or intent is necessary to    make the act criminal, Thus, if two persons beat a    Third and one intent to cause his death and the other    to cause only grievous injury and there is no com-    mon intention, their offences will be different. This    would not be the case if the offence is committed    with a common intention or each accused possesses    the necessary intention or knowledge. Section 38        provides for different degrees of responsibility    arising from the same kind of act.        ",
      "239. To meet the points of common intention    and the responsibility arising therefrom, the true    purports of sections 34, 35 and 38, which read as    follows, are to be examined.    <br>    “34 . When a criminal act is done by several    persons, in furtherance of the common intention    ofall, each of such persons is liable for that act in    the same manner as if it were done by him alone.    <br>    35 . Whenever an act, which is criminal only    by reason of its being done with a criminal    knowledge or intention, is done by several    persons, each of such persons who joins in the    act with such knowledge or intention is liable for    the act in the same manner as if the act were done    by him alone with that knowledge or intention.    <br>    38 . Where several persons are engaged or    concemed in the commission of a criminal act,    they may be guilty of different offences by    means of that act.”        ",
      "238. Mr Anisul Huq and the Advocate-Gene-    ral, on the other hand, submitted that even if it is    assumed that section 34 is not applicable in respect    of Sultan Shahriar this would however be of little    practical benefit to him because his participation in    the criminal conspiracy to implement the object has                          been established by the prosecution. It was further    contended by Mr Huq that section 120A being an    independent offence, order of conviction and sen-    tence may be passed in respect of Sultan Shahriar    under section 120B of the Penal Code.        ",
      "237. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, submitted that    Farook Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) were not    found present in House No.677 at Road No.32 and    that there is also no nexus between the deployment    of artillery troops at Kalabagan play ground by    Mohiuddin (Artillery) and the killing of President    and the members of his family and therefore both of    them have been illegally convicted under sections    302/34 of the Penal Code and further if the offence    committed is found to be a mutiny which being a    military offence, the provisions of sections 34 or    section 38 of the Penal Code as regard common    intention and the responsibility arising therefrom,    will have no manner of application in the present        appeals.        ",
      "236. Mr Khan further submitted that con-    viction in the charge of conspiracy could not be    given after the conspiracy has borne its fruits.        ",
      "235. Md Abdur Razaque Khan, submitted that    Sultan Shahriar was not present at or about the place    of occurrence and in the absence of any overt act or    his participation in the incident of killing with the    other accused persons, his conviction under sections    302/34 is totally illegal and in order to bring Sultan    Shahriar within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal    Code some overt act or acts on his part relating to    the incident must be established to lead to the infer-    ence that he has participated with the participators in    the crime in preconcerted or pre-arranged plan and    except the evidence of PW 14 that he saw him at the    parade ground at Balurghat, there is no other corro-    borating evidence on record that he was in any way    Involved in the alleged occurrence and further the    presence of Sultan Shahriar at the Radio Station at    or around 6-00 AM on 15th August after the    occurrence was part of his official duty, for which,    he cannot be saddled with the charge of murder. Mr    Razaque Khan further submitted that since Sultan    Shahriar was not present at House No.677 of Road    No.32 and has not actively participated in the    murder his act cannot justifiably be held guilty for    the offence committed by other principal offenders    and his act at best attracts an offence of abetment of    murder punishable under section 109 of the Penal    Code as held in the cases of Md Shamsul Hoque vs    State 20 DLR 540, Amor Kumar Thakur vs State 40    DLR (AD) 147, Hazrat Ali vs State 44 DLR (AD) 51    and Dharan Pal vs State of Haryana 1978) 4 SCC    440.        ",
      "234. Further, earlier, the question of consi-    dering such issues of fact in these appeals under    Article 103(3) of the Constitution has already been    discussed. Regarding the charge made against    nan Shahriar under sections 302/34 of the Penal    Code.        ",
      "233. Accordingly what Mr Mamun argued    inpointing on certain portions of the evidence of    he Witnesses regarding the presence of Major    pazlul Huda at the place of occurrence and his    identification by the witnesses which are minor in    nature not to speak of even discrepant statement.    The leaned Counsel failed to point out any contra-    dictory statements of any witness, rather he avoided    our query as to whether the incriminating statements    made by the witnesses about the complicity of    Bazlul Huda had been challenged in course of cross-    examination.        ",
      "232. Further in the case of Moyezuddin [31    DLR (AD) 37] it has been observed as follows:      <br>  “We like to observe that the contradiction        in the statement of a witness, either with his    own statement.                          witnwss is a task of appreciation of the evidence    and therefore, it is within the jurisdiction    of the trial Court and the Court of appeal on    fact, to deal with the question. No doubt there is    certain Tule of prudence governing the case of    contradicting statements. It is first to be seen    whether the alleged statement is a discrepant    statement or contradictory statement. The    discrepant statement  one Which is either irrele-    vant oF incoherent, but it is not irreconcilable, A    giscrepant statement is not fatal to the eredibi-    lity of a witness, A contradictory statement is    one which is conflicting and is not reconcilable    with other statements either of his own or any    other witness. The question in such case is, that    it is open to a Court of fact either to reject the    whole evidence of a witness as untrustworthy or    to reject the contradictory part as unreliable or    to rely upon that portion, which in the opinion    of the Court, fits in with other evidence and the    facts and circumstances of the case.”            ",
      "231. The above statement of law is not    disputed being the established principle of law in the    administration of criminal justice. But in the present    appeals the defence version put forwarded by the    appellants does not affect the prosecution case,    rather supports the prosecution case.        ",
      "230. In the case of Safdar Ali vs Crown [5    DLR (FC) 107(64)] referred by the appellants it has    been observed that in a criminal case, it is the duty    of the Court to review the entire evidence that has    been produced by the prosecution and the defence    and if, after examination of the whole evidence, the    Court is of the opinion that there is a reasonable    possibility that the defence put forward by the    accused must be true and it is clear that such a view    reacts on the whole prosecution, in such circum-    stances, the accused is entitled to get benefit of    doubt, not as a matter of grace, but as of right,    because the prosecution has not proved its case    beyond reasonable doubt.        ",
      "229. The leamed Counsel for the appellants        also referred in the case of Muslimuddin [38 DLR    (AD) 311] wherein the appellants were convicted for    the charge of murder relying upon the evidence of    the deceased wife Majeda (PW 1) which is corrobo-    rated by PW 3 another eye-witness but she was    examined by the police Jong after the occurrence.    The High Court Division maintained his conviction.    The Appellate Division on consideration of the    evidence of PW J, the wife of the deceased, found    that she was present in the hut at the time of occur-    rence but she was not corroborated by other wit-    nesses, and it was totally improbable on her part to    recognise so many accused persons with detailed    description. In that case this Division observed;        “In a criminal trial determination of a    disputed fact is the main task before the Court    and Such determination js dependent upon    consideration of answers given by prosecution    witnesses in their cross-examination, Cross-    examination is therefore, indispensably neces-    sary to bring out desirable facts of a case modi-    fying the examination in-chief or establishing    the cross-examiner’s Own case. The object of    cross-examination is two-fold, to bring out the    case of the party Cross-examining and {    Impeach the credibility of the Witness I,    examination in-chief the witness discloses on,  those facts which are favourable to the Party    examining him and does not disclose the    necessary facts which go in favour of the other    side. Cross-examination in a criminal case aims    at extraction of the facts which support the    defence version which is very often sought to    be supported by the prosecution. The opponents    can of course establish facts favourable to them    by calling their own witnesses, but “there js    some thing dramatic in proving one’s own case    from the mouth of the witnesses of the    opponent.” As observed earlier, in the present    appeals, the defence did not challenge the    incriminating part of the material evidence    adduced by the witnesses and therefore, their    evidence remained uncontroverted. The    defence failed to establisl: facts favourable to    them by cross-examining tlie witnesses. There-    fore, this decision instead of helping the    defence helps the prosecution case.        ",
      "228. In the case of Hazrat Ali (54 DLR 636),    also referred by Counsels of the appellant, it has    been observed that when the evidence of witnesses    is dishelieved by the Court in respect of a major part    of the prosecution case regarding the involvement of    the accused persons the testimony of those witnes-    ses cannot be accepted without independent corro-    boration from other sources. The observations made    by the High Court Division in that case is not    disputed. In the present appeals the learned Counsel    failed to point out any major contradiction in the    evidence of the witnesses so as to disbelieve them in    respect of the majority part of the prosecution case.            ",
      "227. Now the question is, whether a finding    as to whether a witness is reliable or independent as    arrived at by the trial Court and the High Court Divi-    sion is a finding of fact and this finding is binding    on this Court and must be accepted as final? The    case of Nurul Islam [43 DLR (AD) 6) referred by the    Counsels of the appellant, leave was granted to    consider the glaring inconsistency and discrepancy    in the evidence of four eye-witnesses, PWs 1, 3, 7    and 8 which cast a doubt as to the truth of the prose-    cution case. The Appellate Division on assessing                      their evidence found it difficult to rely upon them    and observed that the learned Judges of the High    Court Division did not consider the material discre-    pancy of these eye-witnesses while maintaining the    conviction and sentence. Therefore, this decision    referred by the learned Counsel is not applicable in    this case.        ",
      "45. The first leamed Judge failed to consider the    admitted fact that the appellants along with others    hatched up conspiracy at the parade ground, took    ammunition from the kote, removed heavy artillery    from the cantonment, deployed the troops with    artillery at key points and thereafter they killed the    President and other members of his family as    discussed earlier.        ",
      "226. It may also be mentioned here that all the    above prosecution witnesses are army personnel of    Lancer and Artillery units and the appellants and    other co-accused served in those units. The defence    failed to show any enmity with them or their motive    to depose against them in support of the prosecution    case. The defence also failed to shake their testi-    Monies in any manner rather, they virtually admitted    their participation in the incident of murder by not    challenging the testimonies of those witnesses    relating to material particulars. All of them are    neutral and trustworthy witnesses. There is no    Cogent ground to discard their testimonies. The    second and the Third learned Judges of the High    Court Division and as well as learned Sessions    Judge have believed them as independent and reli-    able witness. The first learned Judge also believed    PWs 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 25, while    believing the complicity of Bazlul Huda, Mohi-    uddin’s (Lancer), Farook Rahman and Sultan    Shahriar but disbelieved PWs 16, 17, 18, 21, 22 . 24.    25, 26, 27, 32, and 35 while disbelieving about    Mohiuddin (Artillery) complicity in the occurrence.    The finding of the first learned Judge that “the    presence of the convict with CO at parade was part    of duty and that parade in the night of 14th August    was held as per preexisting practice as seen from the    evidence of PWs 44 and 45 are based upon piece-    meal consideration of the evidence of PWs 44 and    ",
      "225. As regards the appellant Mohiuddin    (Antillery) PWs 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32, 34    end 35 proved as regards his presence at the night    parade wherefrom the troops of his unit marched to    Kelabagan Lake Circus playground, and set up    cennon aiming at Bangabandhu’s house and the    Rekshibahini Headquarter. The witnesses proved    that 2s per his order, his troops fired 4 rounds of    cemon-ball from Kalabagan play ground aiming at    the house of the President and Rakshibahini    Headquarter. This appellant did not deny the state-    ment of this witness. In view of this evidence on    record it cannot be said that there is no sufficient    materials on record to implicate this appellant in the    occurrence of 15th August, 1975 . No exception    could be inferred from this act of participation in the    night parade and the first learned J udge also did not    take any exception even after he was recognised at    Kalabagan play ground with cannons and firing    cannon-balls aiming at the house of the President    and Rakshibahini Headquarter at the time of occur-    rence. In the premises there is no doubt that this    appellant was involved in the occurrence and helped    the other co-accused to commit the carnage. The    second and the Third learned Judges are perfectly    Justified in finding his complicity in the occurrence.            ",
      "224. As regards Mohiuddin (Lancer), it is    seen that PWs 4 and S saw him while he was enter.    OO ab the house of the President by fiting. PW 4    ve stated that he saw while this appellant Was    fart! ° Rangabandhu down the stairs Bazlul Huda    ee Noor shot him dead. Besides these two    and acces, PW 11 saw him at the gate of the house    onl President at or about the time of occurrence    pW 12 saw him while he was getting down from    $0 rack at the entry point of Road No.32 just    pe F the occurrence. Besides these Witnesses, PWs    5 wl 22 saw him while they were dropped at the    2 ing point of road No.32 . Therefore, I find that    7 iearned Judge of the High Court Division have    x gly found his complicity in the incident of 15th    poust, 1975 . In respect of the charge appellant Sul-    nh ;ahriar PW 14 proved his presence at the night     on 14th August at Balurghat and his compli-    wav in the occurrence have been stated while discus-    sing the evidence of PW 14.            ",
      "223. In respect of the charge of murder    levelled against appellant Farook Rahman, PWs I!    and 12 recognised him at the night parade where-    from he along with his force marched towards    Dhanmondi and thereafter he was seen at the gate of    Bangabandhu’s house at or about the time of    occurrence with a tank and talked with Bazlul Huda,    Mohiuddin (Lancer), Major Noor and others, then    when he was confirmed about the death of the    President and other members of his family, left the    place of occurrence. The evidence of these witnes-    ses sufficiently proved that this appellant was also    involved in the occurrence and the learned Judges of    the High Court Division are perfectly justified in    finding his complicity in the murder.                       ",
      "221. PW 35 corroborated PW 34 and    that he was Subedar Major of the Papa Bang    Two Field Artillery of which the appettany 4\"    commander and he narrated the night trainj, the    14th August in detail and stated that Captain Jat On    gir handed over the parade to the appellant an.    further stated that after the incident he queried ik le    force about the cause for killing of the President.    came to know that this appellant and other acer    persons were involved in the killing Of the Presia.    and his family members. The appellant did ent    challenge the statement of this witness, not        222, Onan analysis of the evidence on    it is seen that there are uncontroverted evid    record against the appellant Bazlul Huda about hic    participation in the killing of Sheikh Kamal and    Bangabandhu on 15th August. PWs 1, 4 and 6 dite    the eye-witness of the occurrence and they have    stated that Bazlul Huda shot to death Sheikh Kamal,    PW 4 further stated that Bazlul Huda along with    Major Nur shot to death the President. Besides these    3 witnesses, PWs 5 and 7 recognised Bazlul Huda at    the time of occurrence at Bangabandhu’s house.    This appellant was also seen by PWs 11, 21 and 22    at the night parade, wherefrom he along with others    came to the house of President and killed Sheikh    Kamal and also the President. So there is direct    complicity of this appellant in the incident of 15th    August, 1975 and the learned Judges of the High    Court are perfectly justified in finding him guilty of    the charge of murder.            ",
      "220. PW 34 a Subedar of Papa Battery of Two    Field Antillery of which the appellant was the    commander, said on 14th August night training he    was present and that their unit moved with six guns    to new airport via Chairman Bari and at about 10-00    PM he heard sounds of firing of gun under Mohi-    uddin (Antillery) near the gun area and that at about    2-30 AM they were made to fall-in again and    thereafter they boarded in a vehicle and proceeded    towards the Science Laboratory via Mohakhali and    from there their vehicle turned towards northern    side and approached through the Mirpur Road and    thereafier, the vehicle Stopped in front of a lake and    at that time the appellant was standing behind the    gun. The troops were directed not to allow anybody        to move on the road. The appellant did not challenge    the statement of this witness,        ",
      "219. PW 32, a sepoy of Two Field Artillery    under the command of the appellant, stated that he    attended the night parade on 14th night and that    their unit was made to fall-in when this appellant    and other officers were present and they were made    to fall-in for the second time at 3-00/3-30 AM when    Major Rashid and other accused were present and    that as per order of Major Rashid they boarded into    the truck and at that time Naik Shamsul Islam gave    him ammunition. He further stated that their truck    started before Fazar Azan and when they reached by    the side of Tejgaon Airport, Lieutenant Hasan    directed them not to allow movement of any vehicle    on the road. He further stated that thereafter he came    to know that the appellant and other co-accused    were involved in the incident. The appellant did not        challenge the statement of this witness in any    manner.        ",
      "218. PW 27, also a sepoy of Two Field Artil-    lery of Papa Battery under Mohiuddin (artillery)    during the relevant time narrated the details of the    night parade on 14th August and that as per    direction of the appellant and as per his order he    boarded on a vehicle and that when the vehicle came    to Balurghat, the appellant told them that Rakhi-    bahini might attack army and thereafter he saw that    a cannon was hooked with a vehicle and the other    vehicles were also hooked with cannons and there-    after they approached towards the Kalabagan via    Mohakhali-Farmgate-Green Road-Elephant Road    and that some of them were directed to get down    from the vehicle near Kalabagan and the appellants    told them not to allow any body to move on the    road. He further stated that when the sun rose one    army vehicle took them to Ganabhaban and there he                      heard the voice of Major Dalim over radio that    Rangabandhu was killed. This appellant did not    challenge the testimony of this witness regarding the    incriminating part of his complicity in the incident,    PW 29, another sepoy of the Papa Battery of Two    Field Artillery Unit, stated that the appellant was the    commander of papa battery and he narrated the    details about the night parade and stated that at    about 3-30 AM the parade was closed and thereafter    they were taken to Balurghat and whereupon they    found that the army personnel were loading arms in    the vehicles. They were directed to load arms,    Thereafter they started towards the town,        ",
      "217. PW 21, a sepoy of Two Field Artillery    Papa Battery, stated that the appellant was comman-    der of Papa Battery. He narrated about the night    parade in which appellant Mohiuddin (Artillery) and    other accused persons were present. He further    stated that at about 4-00/4-30 AM their truck with    arms approached towards Road No.32 and after    stopping at Road No.32, some of the army personnel    were directed to get down from the vehicle and they    were also directed not to allow anybody to move    through the Road No.32 . The defence did not    challenge the statements of this witness in any    manner. PWs 22, 24 and 25 narrated the night    parade on 14th August of Two Field Artillery Unit of    Papa Battery at the airport area in which their com-    mander the appellant was present. Their statements    have not been denied by this appellant. PW 25    further stated that after the parade Farook Rahman    briefed them.        ",
      "216. PW 18, another army personnel of Two    Field Artillery regiment, stated that the appellant    was their Battery Commander and he narrated the    details in respect of parade on 14th August night, in    Which, this appellant and other accused persons    \"ere present. He stated that the night training conti-    nued till 12-30 to 1-00 AM and this appellant    ed the parade. He corroborating PW 17 stated        at at about 3-30/4.00 AM, Abul Kalam made them        fall-in and at that time Captain Jahangir and the        appellant came there and Captain Jahangir told them    that they had to perform an important task of    checking Rakshibahini and directed them to board    into the vehicle. This witness then narrated about the    approaching of their vehicle towards Dhanmondi.    When he heard 4 rounds of firing and some time    thereafter this appellant told them to assemble the    cannons and as per his direction, they proceeded    towards Ganabhaban and after reaching there the    appellant got down from the vehicle and after one    hour he came back and directed them to go to the    Radio Station via New Market.

To prove the charge of murder levelled        : “Mohiuddin (artillery) the prosecution has        again dPWs 17, 18, 91, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32, 34    ned PWS 1%        we the relevant time of which the appellant was    eafurghat on 14th August 1975 .

This appellant during cross-examination did not    challenge the statement of this witness relating to    the incriminating portion.        ",
      "214. Asa general rule, a Court may ac! on the    testimony of a single witness, though uncorrobo-    rated. Unless corroboration is insisted upon by    statute, the Court should not insist on corroboration.    except in cases where the nature of the testimony of                      sale witness itself requires that corroboration    should be insisted Upon, and that the question,    whether corroboration of the testimony of a single    or was not necessary, must depend upon    tis and circumstances of each case.

Admittedly this appellant was a dismissed    released officer from the army and he was not sup-    posed to remain present at the army’s parade at mid-    night on 14th August 1975, The learned Counsel of    the appellant contended that there is no corrobo-    rating evidence of PW 14 to show that this appellant    was present at Balurghat. But as it appears, this    appellant did not deny the statements of PW |4    about his presence at Balurghat, he also did not give    any explanation in his explanation under section 347    of the Code despite the fact that he was confronted    with the statement of PW 14 .

Major Dalim and the other as Major Sultan Shahria,    this appellant Faruque Rahman told that PW 14 ang    other jawans would work with them and that the    troops were required to obey their directions. There.    after, he narrated about the movement of the tanks    and the other incidents. The defence did not    challenge the statement of this witness that he came    at the night parade at Balurghat at 2-00 to '-30 in    civil dress or that Farook Rahman introduced the    jowans about the identity of the appellant. The evi-    dence of this witness so far as it relates to the incri-    minating portion about his participation in the night    parade and his identification remained uncontro-    verted.        ",
      "211. PW 12 made statements corroborating    PW 11 and stated that he saw Farook Rahman and    other accused persons at the parade on 14th August    night. He further stated that Farook Rahman    inspected the parade and directed to follow RDM    night class and thereafter they were made to fall-in    at 3-30 AM, Farook Rahman, Mohiuddin (Lancer)    and other accused persons consulted among them-    selves by the side of parade ground and then they    came in front of them. Thereafter this witness    narrated about marching of the troops towards the    Road No.32 from the parade ground and also    narrated the manner of hearing sounds of firing after    reaching to the place of occurrence.

Thereafter Bazlul Huda and another officer    went to the first floor. Some time thereafter he heard    sounds of firing and screaming of women. In cross-    examination Bazlul Huda did not challenge the    incriminating part of the statement of this witness    and therefore, the statement of PW 6 that he saw    Bazlul Huda while he shot to death Sheikh Kamal    remains uncontroverted.

      "195. PW 1, the informant, was deputed at    House No. 677 of Road No.32, Dhanmondi as the    resident PA of the President during the relevant    time. He stated that on the day of occurrence at    about 4-30 /5-00 AM, the telephone mechanic Abdul    Matin woke him up stating that the President wanted    to talk to him over telephone and after he took the    receiver the President directed him to connect the    Police Control Room stating that the miscreants    attacked the house of Sherniabat, brother-in-law of    the President. He tried but failed to connect the    police control room and then though got convection    of Ganabhaban but there was no response, In the    meantime the President came down into the office    room and wanted to talk himself by taking the    receiver from him. At that time shower Of bullets hi    the wall of the office room breaking the Windy    glass whereupon they lay down beside the lable    After a break of firing the President went UPStairg    and Sheikh Kamal got down and stood op the    verandah, At that time 3/4 army personnel jn khaki    and black dress with arms in their hands stoog in    front of them and the appellant Bazlul Huda shoy on    the leg of Sheikh Kamal who then fell down and lold    PW | to intimate the assailant that he was the Son of    Sheikh Mujib and when PW | informed the ASSailany    about the identity of Sheikh Kamal appellant Bazjy    Huda brushfired aiming Sheikh Kamal. One bulley    hit his leg and another hit PW 50's leg. Sheikh    Kamal died on the spot. At one stage PW 50 wanted    to take out PW I through the back side door ang    when they came nearer to the door, Bazlul Fuda    grabbing his hair pulled him back. There were other    armed army personnel with him. Bazlul Huda lined    up PW | and others in front of the main gate. Some    time thereafter he heard shouting noise of Banga-    bandhu and heard indiscriminate firing and also    screaming of women. He also narrated how Sheikh    Naser was shot to death and the uttering of Bazlul    Huda on query made by Farook Rahman that “all    are finished”, On hearing the above uttering of    Bazlul Huda, he understood that the President and    his family members were brutally killed. The    defence in course of the cross-examination, did not    challenge the statement of this witness regarding    killing of Sheikh Kamal and therefore, the statement    of this witness remains uncontroverted. PW 4, an    army jawan, posted in the field artillery regiment    and during the relevant time deputed at the house of    the President along with other army personnel of his    company, stated that Bazlul Huda and 3 other army    personnel were from the field artillery units, on [Sth    August, 1975 at about 5-00 AM he along with other    guards noticed that Subedar Major Abdul Wahab    Joarder was getting down from the jeep in front of    the house situated on Road No.3! where he along    with other guards were staying using it as temporary    barrack for guarding the house of the President:    thereafier he along with other guards started towards    the house of the President and afer reaching there    they hoisted flag upon playing bugle and at that time    he noticed indiscriminate firing towards the house                      of the president from the southern side of the lake    and at the time black and khaki dressed army personnel red into the house by shouting ‘hands up’    son cl oat time he saw Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin    and a vad another at the gate.

The statement of    ahis witness that he saw Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin    (Lancer) at the gate, that Bazlul Huda, Major Noor    and his force approached to the first floor and that    Bazlul Huda and Major Noor shot at the President    on the stair had not been denied by Bazlul Huda in    course of cross-examination or by giving suggestion    to him and then the incriminating part of the state-    ment of this witness remain, uncontroverted.    Appellant Mohiuddin (Lancer) also did not    challenge the testimony of this witness as regards    his recognition by this witness at the gate of the    house of the President and also the statement of this    witness that he saw Mohiuddin (Lancer) and his    force bringing Bangabandhu down to the ground    floor.

But however in the present appeals there    is difference in the disclosure of extra-judicial con-    fession by PWs § and 15 as whatever admission    made by Bi zlul Huda and proved by PW 8 was    direct in nature but has the element of hearsay and    the other one by PW 15 is indirect in nature and    further, the statements of the appellants have not    been depicted in verbatim as was done in the above        cited case.        ",
      "192. Question arose before the Supreme    Court of India as to whether the above is extra-ju a-    cial confession deposed by PW 9 can be the sole    basis for conviction of the accused. The Supreme    Court of India considered this point in the light of    the views taken in the case of Sahoo (supra) and    other decisions and was of the view that there is    neither any rule nor of prudence that evidence fur-    nished by extra-judicial confession cannot be relied    upon unless corroborated by some other credible    evidence. The Indian Supreme Court on evaluation    of the earlier decisions AIR 1974 SC 1545 . (1975) !     SCR 747, AIR 1975 SC 258, AIR 1966 SC 40 and    AIR 1977 SC 2274) concluded as follows:        “It thus appears that extra-judicial con-    fession appears to have been treated as a weak    piece of evidence but there is no rule of law nor    tule of prudence that it cannot be acted upon    unless corroborated. If the evidence about    extra-judicial confession comes from the mouth    of witness/witnesses who appear to be un-    biased, not even remotely inimical to the    accused, and in respect of whom nothing is    brought out which may tend to indicate that he    may have a motive for attributing an untruthful    statement to the accused; the words spoken to    by the witness are clear, unambiguous and    unmistakably convey that the accused is the                      perpetrator of the crime and nothing is omitted    by the witness which may militate against it,    then after subjecting the evidence of the witness    to a rigorous test, on the touchstone of eredi-    bility, if it passes the test, the extra-judicial con-    fession can be accepted and can be the basis of    a conviction, In such a situation to go in search    of corroboration itself tends to cast a shadow of    doubt over the evidence. If the evidence of    extra-judicial confession is reliable, trustworthy    and beyond reproach the same can be relied    upon and a conviction can be founded thereon.”        ",
      "191. Azmalul Hossain. QC im this re        has referred to the case of State of UP ws ue    Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48 on this point Lin ths    the accused killed his wife and two children. Wit-    ness PW 9 stated that. the accused was seen sifting    in the adjoining room and on seeing him this v witness    asked him as an what has been found about the    murder and in reply the accused appealed “to God to    excuse him that he had committed m    murdered his wife and two children.” The learned    Sessions Judge reproduced the statement    witness as follows:    <br>    “Oh God, pardon me, I have done a blue    der, I have murdered my wife and children.”                ",
      "190. The Supreme Court of India in the facts    ote given case observed as follows:        “But there is 2 clear distinction between the    sdmissibility of evidence and the weight to be    aiached to it. A confessional soliloquy is a    direct piece of evidence. It may be an expres-    sion of conflict of emotion, a conscious effort to    stifle the pricked conscience; an argument to    find excuse or justification for his act; or a    penitent or remorseful act of exaggeration of his    part in the crime. The tone may be soft and low;    the words may be confused; they may be    capable of conflicting interpretations depending    on witnesses, whether they are biased or honest,    intelligent or ignorant, imaginative or prosaic,    as the case may be. Generally they are    mutterings of a confused mind. Before such    evidence can be accepted, it must be established    by cogent evidence what were the exact words    used by the accused. Even if so much was    established. prudence and justice demand the    such evidence cannot be made the sole ground    of conviction. It may be used only as 2    corroborative piece of evidence.” '        ",

      "188. A confessional soliloquy is an expres-    sion of conflict of emotion, a conscious effort to    stifle the pricked conscience; or an argument to find                          excuse or justification for his act or a pertinent or     of exaggeration of part in the crime;        ",
      "187. From the statements quoted above it    appears that admittedly Farook Rahman, Sultan    Shahriar and Mohiuddin (artillery) have in course of    their conversation said they have killed the Presi-    dent and members of his family including Colonel    Jamil. It is also a fact that this statement has not    been communicated to PW 15 but this witness has    overheard the same. As it appears admissions and    confessions are dealt with in sections 24-30 of the    Evidence Act in respect of admissibility of those.    These are exceptions to the general rule of evidence    and they are placed in the category of “relevant fact”    since they are declarations against the maker, the    probative value of such admissions or confessions    do not depend upon its communication to another    and they can be admitted into evidence if they a    proved by a witness.        ",
      "186. The appellants have not denied those    statements by way of cross-examining this Witness    or by way of giving him any suggestion. On behalf    of Sultan Shahriar, suggestion was given to this    witness in evasive manner and the above statement    as made by this witness was not directly. Now the    question is, whether the above statement can be    taken as extra-judicial confession since it has no,    been communicated by the above accuseds to this    witness by stating to him that they killed the President and his family members. It also appears that    this point has not been canvassed in the Courts    below. But this being a question of law as to whether    any such statement made by an accused relating to    the incident to which he has faced trial and directly    relevant to the point involved in this case, its impli-    cation should be considered.        ",
      "185. On behalf of the appellants it was argued    the prosecution did not raise this point in the Courts    below and therefore, this point cannot be taken into    consideration at this stage and further the alleged    statement not being communicated to PW 5 by this    witness in no circumstances the same can be treated    as extra-judicial confession. PW 15 in his statement        stated that—            ",
      "184. It thus appears that appellant Bazlul    Huda admitted to this witness that he killed Sheikh    Kamal because he was giving information about the    incident outside. He also admitted that they killed    one security personnel as he was altercating with        them and thereafter on query about the cause of    death of Sheikh Naser, Captain Huda remained    he killing of the        silent and on further query about t t    President he replied that as the President queried        why they came there and asked about Shafiullah that    prompted him to shoot him and on further query    about the killing of womenfolk Bazlul Huda replied    that the situation went beyond their control and the    sepoys killed them There is no denial either directly    or indirectly about those admissions of Bazlul Huda    to PW 8 . These evidence remain uncontroverted    whether these statements may be taken as extra-judi-    cial confession in which Bazlul Huda has admitted    about his active role and killing of Sheikh Kamal by    gun shot whether the other appellants Farook Rah-    man, Sultan Shahriar. Mohiuddin (Lancer) and    Mohiuddin can be convicted relying upon this state-    ment. It thus shows that while in Bangabhahan PW    15, found Farook Rahman, Major Abdur Rashid,    Sultan Shahriar, Major Shariful Hoque Dalim,    Major Aziz Pasha, Mohiuddin (Lancer), Bazlul    Huda and others were gossiping during which they    disclosed how they killed the President and his    family members.            ",
      "182. Regarding the extra-judicial confession    as disclosed by PWs 8 and 15 in support of charge    against the appellants for murder, as it appears, as    those statements have not been challenged by the    defence during cross-examination.        183, As it appears PW 8, who was working in    the army in the rank of Captain during the relevant    lime, in his deposition stated that being deputed by    Chief of Army Staff to report after ascertaining the    Teal position in the house of the President, he visited    the said house on 15th August at about 8-45 AM.    PW 8 had stated that Major Nur Chowdhury and        zlul Huda received him and thereupon Bazlul    da took him inside the house. He narrated the    *lual position as noticed there as follows:            ",
      "181. However, because of the express provi-    sions in the existing law as referred earlier as to how    evidence are to be taken, I am of the view that the    electronic evidence produced by the prosecution in    this case cannot be used.        ",
      "180. The challenges before the criminal jus-    _. eystem are to balance the rights of the accused    eon dispensing speedy and effective justice. The    r nal justice system machinery must also meet    om pallenge of effectively dealing with the emer-    sine forms of crime and behaviour of criminals. It is    “so hoped that the obsolete laws or obsolete    tials of laws prevailing in the country will be    smended and new suitable laws will also be enacted    o respond to the needs of changing society as was    gone in India in respect of electronic evidence.        ",
      "179. Accordingly, it is high time to evaluate    she slogical developments are transforming    ow yee of the legal system. With the emer-    the he reve technologies, uncertainties arise    gence ° rd to the application of existing laws and    with ey there is a need to create new laws to    segs rir use, However, at the same time it is to    regulate ‘mind that need for regulating new techno-    e KE S aasaally prompted by social and cultural    jogies ane about the advantage of a particular tech-    ae alternatively, the scope of its misuse.        ",
      "178. Further, Bhagabati J in the case of    National Textile Workers’ Union vs PR Rama-    krishnan, AIR 1983 SC 75, Bhagwati, J speaking for    the majority observed as follows.    <br>    “We cannot allow the dead hand of the past    to stifle the growth of the living present. Law    cannot stand still; it must change with the    changing social concepts and values. If the bark    that protects the tree fails to grow and expand    along with the tree, it will either choke the tree    or if it is a living tree, it will shed that bark and    grow a new living bark for itself. Similarly, if    the law fails to respond the needs of changing    society, then either it will stifle the growth of    the society and choke its progress or if the    society is vigorous enough, it will cast away the    law which stands in the way of its growth. Law                      therefore constantly be on the move    i itself to the fast-changing society and    not lag behind.        ",
      "177. However, the Evidence Act of 1872 isa    procedural law and at the same time is an ongoing    statute. According to Francis Benion, the principle    of interpretation of an ongoing statute should be that    Parliament intends the Court to apply to an ongoing    Act a construction that continuously updates its    wordings to allow for changes in an Act which was    initially framed. While it remains law it has to be    treated as always speaking.        ",
      "176. The modes for recording evidence has    been expressly laid down in section 353 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure which provides that except as    otherwise provided, all evidence taken under    chapter XX, XXII and XXIII shall be taken in the    presence of the accused, or, when his personal    attendance is dispensed with, in presence of his    Advocate. This shows that though the actual physi-    cal presence of the accused is necessary while    taking evidence, it may be dispensed with in certain    circumstances.        ",
      "175. Inthe case of State of Maharashtra vs p,.    Praful B. Desai, (2003) 4 scc 601 the Supreme    Court of India ruled that the evidence taken from 4    witness through video conferencing is Compatible    with the requirements of the Code.        ",
      "174. However as regards admissibility of a    statement recorded in a compact disk or video cas-    sette or in a television channel, if the accused does    not deny his statement or admission, there is no    difficulty in admitting such digital or electronic    evidence as documentary evidence. However, if the        accused denies the statement or admission, the’        question of its admissibility has to be looked into    under the prevailing law of evidence. As it appears    the expression ‘evidence’ has been defined in    section 3 of the Evidence Act which is as follows:        ‘Evidence’ means and includes—    <br>    (1) all statements which the Court permits    or requires to be made before it by a witness, in    relation to matters of fact under enquiry; such    statements are called oral evidence;  <br>      . (2) All documents produced for the    inspection of the Court, such documents are    called documentary evidence,        However in India sub-section 2 of section 3    of the Evidence Act as above has been substi-    tuted in the year is as follows:  <br>      (2) all documents including electronic record    produced for the inspection of the Court; such    ?    documents are called documentary evidence        go, in terms of the above amendmen, in    in criminal matters, evidence can also be    of electronic record as video Cassette    and video conferencing.              ",
      "173. Regarding the admission of digital or electric evidence, as it appears the party seeking to admit any statement or admission of any person recorded in any person recorded in a compact disk or video cassette or any interview conducted by any television channel relating to a relevant fact or facts in issue, must also produce the original compact disk or video cassette or the programme published in the television channel with the certificate of the producer of the programme and further the signature of the producer in the certificate has also to be proved. In the present appeals, these requirements have not been met.        ",
      "172. However, as it appears in terms of    section 57 of Evidence Act, the Court itself may take    cognizance of certain matter which are so notorious    or so clearly established that the evidence of their                      existence is deemed unnecessary. But as it appears    the alleged statement made by appellant    Rahman to a reporter of the issue of the ''Sunday    Times” is in the nature of hearsay evidence     prosecution did not examine the reporter Who inter    viewed the above appellant,    admission of digital or    electronic evidence, as it appears the party     to admit any statement or admission of any pers     recorded in a compact disk or video cassette or al ,    interview conducted by any television a rake    relating to a relevant fact or facts in Issue, must also    disk or video cassette        produce the original compact on    d in the television chan-        or the programme publishe    nel with the certificate of the producer of the pro-    sume certifying the date and place of the record        ",
      "171. PW 58, exhibited the issue of the    Sunday Times\" dated 8-5-1976, which was marked    Exhibit X with a note of objection by the defence,    Stating that he while acting as Director, Ministry of    Foreign Affairs, at the request of Criminal Investi-    gation Department, CID, collected a copy of the    Sunday Times\" through the then Councilor of Ban-    gladesh High Commission at London, in which the    appellant Farook Rahman, admitted his complicity    by saying \"I helped to kill Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,    dare to put me on trial\", PW 58, also proved the for-    warding letter with the signature of the Councilor by    which the above Journal was sent to him. PW 58    also exhibited with objection Exhibit 32, a video    cassette broadcasted by Granada Independent    Television in the UK on 2nd August 1976, along    with notarised certificate issued by Keith Robert    Hopkins, Notary Public, certifying that to the best of    his knowledge, information and belief, the said    video cassette is an authentic copy of a television    programme. Further, Mr Boktiar Hossain, PW 59, a    local video recorder, also proved the video cassette,    Exhibit-12, in which Major Rashid and Farook Rah-    man, in an interview by Anthony Mascaranthus    stated that they killed Sheikh Mujib along with his    family. According to the Learned Attorney the issue    of \"Sunday Times\", Exhibit X, is a document within    the meaning of section 3 of Evidence Act in which    Farook Rahman admitted his participation in the    killing of the President while giving his interview    and further the incident of 15th August 1975 being a    sad historic fact in Bangladesh, any book or    document in reference to the above incident may be    taken as judicial notice under the provisions of    section 57 of the Evidence Act on such a fact and    further since Faruque Rahman during cross exami-    nation did not deny his said interview with Anthony    Mascaranthus, the video cassettes, Material Exhibits    32 and Exhibit 12, may also be admitted as        evidence.        ",
      "169. The learned Counsels, in support of their    contentions, referred the cases of Nurul Islam vs    Sate, 43 DLR (AD) 6, Hazrat Khan @ Hazrat Ali vs    Sate, 54 DLR 636, Moslemuddin vs State, 38 DLR    (AD) 311, Safdor Ali vs Crown, 5 DLR (FC) 107 and    Moyecuddin vs State, 31 DLR (AD) 37 . Mr Anisul    Hug and learned Attorney-General submitted that    the evidence that came forth from the deposition of    the witnesses proved the charge of murder and    further Exhibit X, the copy of the “Sunday Times”    and also the electronic evidence, Material Exhibits    12 and 32 also proved charge of murder. The learned    Attomey-General and Mr Azmalul Hossain to prove    the charge of murder also relied upon the extra-        judicial confessions of the appellants as disclosed by    PWs 8 and 15,            ",
      "168. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, learned Coun-    cagaring for Sultan Shahriar, further submitted        «el ee js no reliable evidence regarding Sultan    th nes complicity in the murder of the President    seb of his family; he did not go to House    mm a ot Dhanmondi; the High Court Division    Noo iy jaw in relying upon the testimony of PW 14    cee his presence at the night parade at Balur-    ” reve though there is no corroborating evidence    a and if the evidence of PW 14 is disbelieved    i remains only evidence against Sultan Shahriar    or ding his presence at the Radio Station at about    ant 4M on 15th August and this fact has no nexus    vp the murder of the President and his family    embers 28 being reemployed with effect from 15th    zst, 1975, his presence in the Radio Station was    : oat of his official duty which he had carried out as        per direction of his Commanding Officer.        ",
      "167. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, learned Coun-    sel appearing for the appellants Syed Farook    Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) further    submitted that there is no evidence in support of the    charge for causing the murder of the President and    the members of his family by the appellants and PW    1 is not an eye-witness of the occurrence and Mohi-    uddin (artillery) is not an FIR named accused and    his inclusion in the case is a product of concoction:    the story of hoisting of flag and playing bugle in the    house of the President just immediate before the    occurrence as stated by the P.Ws are not believable    since PWs 1-3 stated that at that time the assailants    were already in the house of the President; there 5    at all no evidence on record to show the presence of    Farook Rahman in the house of the President at the    relevant time ; the presence of Mohiuddin (artillery)    with cannon at Kalabagan playground has not bee\"    substantiated by adducing reliable evidence; in vie\"    of withholding of tank crews an adverse presumption           may be drawn against the prosecution as if they    were produced they would not have supported the    case; in view of the evidence as reveal.    ee the lips of the prosecution Witnesses the real    ad ri of the incident Was Jobaida Rashid; from the    inne of the PWs it will also be evident that the    oi ant had no common intention Or preconcert    af og their being involved in the under of the    section 302/34 was illegel.        ",
      "166. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, learned Coun,    sel appearing for the appellant Bazlul Hud, ana    Mohiuddin (Lancer), further submitted that they. ‘    no reliable evidence in support of the proseciy; on    story that these appellants have been recognised p,,    the informant at the place of occurrence, w.    allegation that Bazlul Huda shot to death Sheiks    Kamal and Bangabandhu is also based on contr,    dictory evidence on record; the prosecution fh,    withheld vital witnesses such as, Sheikh Yunus Aj;    Colonel Moshiud Doula and Colonel Mahmudy    Hasan purposely 2s their evidence would have bee,    unfavourable to the prosecution and therefore 2,    adverse inference may be drawn against the    prosecution for withholcing those vital witnesses.    the allegation that Mohiuddin (Lancer) was taking    the President down from the first floor is based on    no reliable evidence on record and further the    recognition of Mohiuddin (Lancer) by the witnesses    at the place of occurrence is totally absurd and    unbelievable story and further the evidence on    record about the presence of Bazlul Huda and Mohi-    uddin (Lancer) at the place of occurrence is also    contradictory.        ",
      "165. Regarding the fifth ground i.e. the    murder of the President and the members of his    family, the learned Counsels for the appellants made    common submissions that the learned Judges of the    High Court Division upon superficial consideration    of the evidence on record and on mere conjecture    and surmise confirmed the death sentence of the    appellants and failed to consider that there is no    legal evidence on record in support of the charges    under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and that the    appellants along with other accuseds attended the    night parade merely as a routine work and further,    their presence at the parade could not be connected    with the murder of the President and his family    members and the killing of the President and his    family members was a revolt to overthrow the then    Government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and in    consequence of such revolt only, the President ang ;    his family members were killed by the army    which the appellants were not involved.        ",
      "164. The above evidence prove that the appel-    lants and other accuseds made criminal conspiracy to    murder the President and the members of his family.        ",
      "163. But as it appears most of them were    removed army officer and PWs 44 and 47 proved    that they were absorbed in service by General Ziaur    Rahman after he came to power on 7th November,    1975 and earlier when Khondker Mustaque Ahmed,    selected person, was dethroned by Khaled    Mosharraf they left the country on the evening of    3rd March . If the evidence of PWs 44, 45 and 47 are    read along with those of PW 60 it will appear that    the appellants and other co-accuseds, as part of their    premeditated plan arranged night parade and then    came out from the cantonment with tanks and other    arms without authorisation and some then went to    the house of the President situated at Road No. 32,    and also other key points such as Radio Station,    Minto Road, BDR Headquarter, Rakhibahini Head-    quarter with a view to prevent the Government and    security forces from interfering in their object of    killing the President and his family members and    that afier killing of the President and his family    members they compelled the Chief of Army, Navy                      and Air Force to express their allegiance after the    killing and accepting Khondker Mustaque Ahmed as    the President of the Republic and that thereafter they    stayed at Bangabhaban and guarded Khondker    Mustaque Ahmed and the Radio Station so that any    other could not topple Khandaker Mushtaque    Ahammed and they attended in the oath taking    ceremonies of the President, his Cabinet although    they were not supposed to be present al such    national ceremonies being petty officers in the army    and some of them including the appellant Sultan    Shahriar were removed officers and some of them        arranged for burying the dead bodies and the act of    flecing away from the country after the incident of    3rd November and taking shelter in Bangkok and    thereafter their absorption at the different Bangla-    deshi Missions by late General Ziaur Rahman and    then on removal from the service after their abortive    attempt to revolt against Ziaur Rahman and their    staying abroad are the circumstances which prove    that they were involved in the killing of the    President and other members of his family. These    conducts of appellants other than accused persons    are relevant under section 8 of the Evidence Act and    may be taken as corroborative evidence for fur-    nishing further proof of the guilt @f the appellants    and other accused persons.        ",
      "162. The Third learned Judge however was of    the view that the deployment of some of the appel-    lants and other accuséd persons in the foreign    embassies could not be taken as reward for their    involvement in the carnage of 1 5th August and so no    adverse inference could be drawn against them by    reason of such employment.        ",
      "161. In support of the subsequent conduct of    the appellants ad other accuseds, the prosecution has    examined PWs 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 20, 23, 37, 42, 44,    45, 46, 47, 49 and 60 . PW 9 stated that on 15th    August at about 3-00 PM he went to the house of the    President as per direction of PW 45 for ascertaining    the condition of that house where Bazlul Huda    received him at the gate of that house and under the    supervision of Mohiuddin (Lancer) the dead body of    the President was sent to Tongipara through a heli-    copter. PW 12 stated that he saw Farook Rahman    while he was coming towards Mirpur Road from    Road No.32 with a tank at 7-15 AM on 15th August.    PW 15 saw Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar, Bazlul    Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) at Bangabhaban 0n                              the day of occurrence at about 4-00 PM, PW 16 saw    Farook Rahman on a jeep in front of Shanghai Res-    gaurant, Kalabagan, Mirpur Road, on 1Sth August in    the moming While he was approaching towards    south of the house of the President. PW 16 after    going 1 Bangabhaban a” saw Mohiuddin (Artil-    lery) with his troops, PW 20 stated that he saw    Shahar and Farook Rahman and other officers    inside Bangabhaban ater the occurrence. PW 23    ed that after the incident he did not see Farook    Rahman and Mohiuddin (Lancer) in the Lancer Unit    and heard that they were then staying at Banga-    phaban. pW 37 stated that after the incident he at the    studio No.2 of the Radio Station, saw Shahriar,    along with other co-accuseds were preparing speech    of khondker Mustaque Ahmed of Bangladesh Radio    on 15th August 1975 at 7-00 AM. PW 42 stated that    he found Shahriar, Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Farook    Rahman in the Radio Station on 15th August when    the Chief of Army, Navy and Air Force came there    to broadcast their allegiance by radio and that he    giso found Bazlul Huda and Nur when he went to    road No.32 on 15th August at 11-00 AM for taking    pictures of the victims as per direction of the autho-    rity and that he also saw Shahriar Rashid, Farook    Rahman, Mohiuddin (Lancer) and other accused        ersons in the President’s room at Bangabhaban in    the aftemoon. PW 44 stated that while the officers    involved in the killing of 15th August and 3rd    November, were staying in Bangkok, the so-called    “sepahi biplob” (armed revolution) occurred on 7th    November, 1975, and Major General Ziaur Rahman    became the exclusive powerful leader and that after    taking over power, he repatriated the officers    involved in the killing of 15th August and 3rd    November by arranging their service at foreign    embassies of Bangladesh. He further stated that    those officers made abortive attempt of revolt    against General Ziaur Rahman and thereafter they    were removed from the service and thereafter they    led their lives abroad as fugitive. The appellants did    not challenge the statements of this witness, PW 45    stated that at the oath taking ceremony of Khondker    Mustaque Ahmed as President, Bazlul Huda, Farook    Ahmed and other co-accuseds were present, PWs 46    noticed Farook Rahman, Shahriar, Bazlul Huda and    other accused persons were sitting beside Khondker        MAJOR BAZLUL Hupa vs State (Md Tafeceul Islam J 47        Mustaque Ahmed, who was sitting on the chair of    the President at about 3-30 PM at Banga Bhaban on    the day of occurrence. PW 47 also saw Farook    Rahman, Shahriar Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Bazlul    Huda at the oath taking ceremony of Khandaker    Mustaque Ahmed and his Cabinet and that after the    incident of 3rd November, Major Abdur Rashid and    other accused persons left for Bangkok. PW 49    stated that on 15th August Major Dalim introduced    him with Farook Rahman after broadcasting the    allegiance by the Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air    Force in the Radio Station. PW 60 stated that a file    was opened for absorbing some army officers in the    Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 8th June, 1976 and    thereafter, as per letter of Army Headquarter under    Memo. dated 15th August, 1976, Mohiuddin    (Lancer), Bazlul Huda, Sultan Shahriar and other    co-accused have been deputed to the Ministry of    Foreign A ffairs.        ",
      "160. As it appears according to the Prosecy    tion story, the appellants along with other ACCUSe,    arranged the parade on the night of 14th August, “i    in the army rule though there was no Provision for    taking arms at such exercise they took arms from the    armory and marched towards Road No. 32, Dhan.    mondi where the President was residing, Minto    Road where the Cabinet Ministers were Staying, the    Radio Station and in front of Rakhibahini Head.    quarter and setting up cannons aiming Rakhibahin;    Headquarter and Road No. 32 to use those if there    was any resistance from the Rakhibahini or othe;    forces and they also took cannon with ammunition    and tanks which could not be taken out of canton.    ment during normal time. These arms, ammunition    and heavy artillery like cannons and tanks they    carried just before the occurrence and set up those    mainly with the motive to resist and prevent the    counter-attack of Government and other security    forces. These preparations of the appellants and    other accuseds have relevancy with the occurrence    in that they took those measures in a calculated way    to bring about the premeditated action of killing.    After taking all these precautions, they attacked the    house of the President situated at Road No.32    Dhanmondi R/A and killed the President and all the    members of his family.        ",
      "159. The first learned Judge also disbelieved    PW 46 about his identification of the appellants    Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar, Bazlul Huda and    other accuseds at Bangabhaban on the reasoning    that there was nothing on record to show that he    knew them earlier. This finding of the learned Judge    is inconsistent, inasmuch as the learned Judge    himself believed the presence of these appellants at    Bangabhaban and made adverse inference regarding    their presence only in the oath taking ceremony on    the ground that they, being junior army officers,    were not supposed to remain present at Ban,    bhaban in the President's oath taking ceremon.    PWes 15 and 47 also deposed that they saw them ..    Bangabhaban. Therefore, the learned second J 7    has rightly believed witness PW 46, Be        ",
      "158. Accordingly, I am in complete agree-    ment with the views of the learned second Judge    that the learned Sessions Judge inadvertently    recorded the suggestion in question in affirmative    although PW 24 replied in negative.        ",
      "157. The first learned Judge however, dis-    believed PW 24 on the reasoning that in course of    cross-examination on behalf of Farook Rahman in    answer to a suggestion he stated that as per version    of the police he deposed against the accuseds on the    apprehension that otherwise he would be made an    accused in the case as he was found present at the    house of Sherniabat. The second learned Judge,    however, believed PW 24 on the reasonings that a    perusal of his statement in its entirety in cross would    sugeest that he denied the above suggestion but the    learned Sessions Judge recorded his statement in the    positive form inadvertently and as it appears PW 24    denied the almost similar suggestion made to him on    behalf of Colonel Mohiuddin (artillery). Further,    this witness deposed in Court on 19th October,    1997, after more than 22 years of the occurrence and    at this belated stage there was no occasion for him    to harbour any apprehension of being implicated in    Sherniabat’s murder case since the cases were filed    long ago and moreover, the above statement was    made while deposing before the Court and not        before the police.        ",
      "156. Further regarding previous conduct of    the appellants depositions show that PW 11 recog-    nised Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman,    Mohiuddin (Lancer), and Bazlul Huda at the night    parade. PW 12 recognised Mohiuddin (Lancer),    Farook Rahman and Bazlul Huda at the night parade    on 14th August. PW 13 recognised Major Mohi-    uddin (Lancer) and Farook Rahman. PW 14    recognised Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Shahriar. PWs    17 and 18 recognised Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-    uddin (Artillery) at the parade ground on 14th night.    PWs 21 and 22 recognised Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-    uddin (Artillery) and Bazlul Huda at the parade    ground. PW 23 recognised Lieutenant Colonel    Farook Rahman at the parade ground. PW 24 recog-    nised. Farook Rahman, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Artillery) and Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar at the    parade ground.

According to the prosecution, the    appellants along with other accused persons hatched    up a conspiracy the killing of the President and his    kith and kin with a view to mitigate their persona]    vengeance and also to fulfil their personal ambition    and with that end in view, they arranged a night    parade on 14th August, 1975, and in the night    parade the appellant Farook Rahman and other co-    accuseds incited the jawans attending it, took arms    from the kote, deployed officers and jawans at key    points and then some of them came to the official    residence of the President and brutally killed him    and his family members and that such yearly night    parade starts in the evening and ends at 11-00 PM    but the night parade of 14th August continued till    early hours of 15th August and moreover, there is no    provision for amalgamation of two units of army in    the parade but the appellants and other accuseds for    the fulfilment of their criminal object in violation of    the Rules amalgamated Lancer unit and Artillery    unit and that further though there is prohibition for    carrying ammunition at such exercise but the    appellants and the co-accuseds carried ammunition    from the kote for the implemen- tation of the object,    it will be necessary to keep in view the limited scope    n this appeal under Article 103(3) of the    Constitution against the judgments and orders of    conviction and sentence by which the High Court    Division confirmed the conviction and sentence    passed by the trial Court. The appellants have not    raised any point as to whether the trial of the    appellants has been vitiated by reason of mis-    reading, non reading or non consideration of the    evidence on record, Despite that we have afforded                      learned Counsels to argue the appeals at length on merit of the evidence on record for ends of justice since the appellants have been sentence is death.

      "136. So, in terms of the principle    above, each conspirator plays his Separate part in    one integrated and united effort lo achieve the    common purpose. Each one is aware that he has a    part to play in a general conspiracy though he ma    not know all its secrets or the means by which the    common purpose is to be accomplished. The evil    scheme may be promoted by a few, some may drop    out and some may join at a later Stage but he    Conspiracy continues until it is broken up. There    as laid down    general plan to accomplish the Commo,    design by such means as may from time to time tis    found expedient. New techniques may be inventes    and new means may be devised for advancement -    the common plan. The common intention of th.    conspirators then is to work for the furtherance of    the common design. Conspirators do not discuss the    plans in the presence of the stranger or outsider    Since privacy and secrecy are the elements of    criminal conspiracy it is difficult to obtain direc,    evidence in its proof. It can, therefore, be proved by    evidence of surrounding circumstances and conduc;    of the accused both before and after the commission    of the crime.        ",
      "135. If thus appears that, in order to cons-    titute the offence of conspiracy, there must first be a    combining together of two or more persons in the    conspiracy; secondly, an act or illegal omission must    take place in pursuance of that conspiracy in order    io the doing of that thing. It is not necessary that the    abetter should concert the offence with the person    who commits it. ]t is sufficient if he engages in the    conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is    committed. Chapter VA, introduced a new offence    defined by section 120A. That offence is called the    offence of criminal conspiracy and consists in a    mere agreement by two or more persons to do or    cause 10 be done an illegal act or an act which is not    illegal by illegal means; there is a proviso to the    section which says that no agreement except an    agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a    criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the    agreement is done by one or more parties to such    dercement in pursuance thereof,        ",

Ina later case in Suresh Chandra Bahri    vs Gurbachan Singh AIR 1994 SC 2420, the    Supreme Court of India held as observed:    <br>    “In the above context we may refer to the    provisions of section 120A of the Indian Penal    Code which defines criminal conspiracy, It    provides that when two or more persons agree    to do, or cause to be done. (1) an illegal act, or    (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means,    such agreement is designated a criminal conspi-    racy; provided that no agreement except an    agreement to commit an offence shall amount    to criminal conspiracy unless some act besides    the agreement is done by one or more parties to    such agreement in pursuance thereof. Thus, a    cursory look to the provisions contained in    section 120A reveal that a criminal conspiracy    envisages an agreement between two or more    persons to commit an illegal act or an act which    by itself may not be illegal but the same is done    or executed by illegal means. Thus the essential    ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy    is the agreement to commit an offence. In a case    where the agreement is for accomplishment of    an act which by itself constitutes an offence,    then in that event no overt act is necessary to be    proved by the prosecution because in such a    fact situation criminal conspiracy is established    by proving such an agreement, In other words,    where the conspiracy alleged is with regard to    commission of a serious crime of the nature as    contemplated in section 120B read with the    provision to sub-section (2) of section 120A of    the IPC, then in that event mere proof of an    agreement between the accused for commission    of such a crime alone is enough to bring about    a conviction under section 120B and the proof    of any overt act by the accused or by any one of    them would not be necessary. The provisions in    such a situation do not require that each. and    every person who is a party to the conspiracy    must do some overt act towards the fulfilment    of the object of conspiracy, the essential ingredient                      being an agreement between the conspirators to commit the crime and if these requirements and ingredients are established the act would fall within the tapping of the provisions contained in section 120B since from its very nature a conspiracy must be    hatched in complete secrecy, because     the whole purpose may frustrate and it is    common experience and goes without saying that    only in very rare cases one may come across    direct evidence of a criminal conspiracy to    commit anv crime and in most of the cases it is    only the circumstantial evidence which is avail-    able from which an inference giving rise to the    conclusion of an agreement between two or    more persons to commit an offence may be    legitimately drawn.”        ",
      "133. Reference to sections 120A and 120B of    the Penal Code which have brought the “Law of    Conspiracy” in the then India, will show that those    are in line with the English law by making the overt    act unessential when the conspiracy is to commit    any punishable offence and the provisions of section    120A would make these aspects clear beyond doubt.    Entering into an agreement by two or more persons    to do an illegal act or legal act by illegal means is the    very quintessence of the offence of conspiracy:    Section 10 also has a reference to section 120A of    the Penal Code which provides: “when two or more    Persons agree to do, or cause to be done, (a) an ille-    gal act, or (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal    means, such an agreement is designated a criminal    conspiracy.” A proviso has been added which                      provides that no agreement except an agreement to    commit offence shall amount to conspiracy.    Therefore, it is apparent that a prima facie case of    racy has to be established for the application    conspiracy‘    of section 10 of the Evidence Act. There must be    reasonable ground to believe that two or more        persons have conspired together in the light of the    language of section 120A of the Penal Code. In    Kehar Singh vs State, AIR 1988 SC 1883 section    120A is explained in the following manner:        “This section mainly could be divided into    two: the first part talks of where there is reason-    able ground to believe that two or more persons    have conspired to commit an offence or an    actionable wrong, and it is only when this con-    dition precedent is satisfied that the subsequent    part of the section comes into operation and it is    material to note that this part of the section talks    of reasonable grounds to believe that two or    more persons have conspired together and this    evidently has reference to section 120A where it    is provided “When two or more persons agree    to do, or cause to be done”. This further has    been safeguarded by providing a proviso that no    agreement except an agreement to commit an    offence shall amount to criminal conspiracy. It    will be therefore necessary that a prima facie    case of conspiracy has to be established for    application of section 10 . The second part of    section talks of anything said, done or written    by any one of such persons in reference to the    common intention after the time when such    intention was first entertained by any one of    them is relevant fact against each of the persons    believed to be so conspiring as well for the    purpose for proving the existence of the    conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that    any such person was a party to it. It is clear that    this second part permits the use of evidence    which otherwise could not be used against the    accused person. It is well settled that act or    action of one of the accused could not be used    as evidence against the other. But an exception    has been carved out in section 10 in cases of    conspiracy. The second part operates only when    the first part of the section is clearly established    i.e. there must be reasonable ground to believe    that two or more persons have conspired        together in the light of the language of section    120A. It is only then the evidence of action or    statements made by one of the accused could be    used as evidence against the other.”        ",
      "132. It will be thus seen that the most import-    ant ingredient of the offence of conspiracy is the    agreement between two or more persons to do an    illegal act. The illegal act may or may nor be done    in pursuance of agreement, but the very agreement    is an offence and is punishable.        ",
      "131. Coleridge, J. while summing up the Case    to Jury in Regina vs Murphy, (1837) 173 ER sq)        (508) pertinently states:    <br>    “Tam bound to tell you, that although th,    common design is the root of the charge, jx is    not necessary to prove that these two Parties    came together and actually agreed in terms to    have this common design and to pursue it by    common means, and so to carry it into execy.    tion. This is not necessary, because in many    cases of the most clearly established conspi-    racies there are no means of proving any such    thing, and neither law nor commonsense    requires that it should be proved. If you fing    that these two persons pursued by their acts the    same object, often by the same means, one per-    forming one part of an act, so as to complete it,    with a view to the attainment of the object    which they were pursuing, you will be at liberty    to draw the conclusion that they have been    engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object.    The question you have to ask yourselves is,    “Had they this common design, and did they    pursue it by these common means—the design    being unlawful ?”        ",
      "130. He explained “Mere knowledge of and    mental consent to a crime about to be committed by    another does not make a mana conspirator, but quite    a slight participation in the plan will be sufficient,”        ",
      "129. Glanville Williams in the “Criminal    Law” (Second Ed.382) explains the proposition    with an illustration:        “The question arose in an Lowa case, but it    was discussed in terms of conspiracy rather    than of accessoryship. D, who had grievance    against P told E that if he would whip P some-    one would pay his fine, F replied that he did not    want anyone to pay his fine, that he had a    grievance of his own against P and that he    would whip him at the first opportunity, E    whipped P. D was acquitted of conspiracy    because there was no agreement for “ concert of    action”, no agreement to “co-operate”,        ",
      "128. The English Law on this matter is well    settled. The following passage from Russell on Crime    (12th Edition Volume 1, 202) may be usefully noted:  <br>      “The gist of the offence of conspiracy then    lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the pur-    pose for which the conspiracy is formed, nor in    attempting to do them, nor in inciting others to    do them, but in the forming of the scheme or    agreement between the parties. Agreement is    essential. Mere knowledge, or even discussion,    of the plan is not, per se, enough.”        ",
      "127. Under the common law, conspiracy con-    sists in an agreement between two or more persons    to achieve an unlawful object, unlawful being used    in a special sense here. The offence consists in the    combining. So long as such a design rests In    intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree    to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself.    The offence is, therefore, complete though no    further act is done in pursuance of the agreement    and, provided that if the stage of negotiations has    been passed, it will be a conspiracy even “where the    parties had not settled the means to be employed.” It    is not necessary that a person charged with conspi-    racy should also be an accomplice.        ",
      "126. The elements of criminal conspiracy are    (a) an agreement between two or more persons, (b)    to do an illegal act, or (c) to do a legal act by illegal    means, and (d) an overt act done in pursuance of the    conspiracy. Further, in order to prove a charge of    criminal conspiracy for an offence under section    120B of the Penal Code, the prosecution need not    prove that the perpetrators expressly agreed to do or    caused to be done the illegal act; the agreement may    be proved even by necessary implication. In a    conspiracy, persons are often required to do various    acts at various stages and even if for the first time    they come into conspiracy at a latter stage they are    members of the conspiracy provided their act is    calculated to promote the object of the conspiracy. It    is no doubt true that the offence is complete as soon    as an agreement, is made between the conspirators    and in that case they would be punishable under    section 120B. The essence of the offence is the com-    bination of agreement express or implied, the actus    reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to commit an    offence, not execution of it. It is enough if it is    shown a meeting of minds, a consensus to affect an    unlawful purpose, It can be established by direct or    circumstantial evidence. Privacy and secrecy are    main characteristics of a conspiracy than of a loud    discussion in an elevated place open to public view.    It is not always possible to give direct evidence    about the date, place and time of the formation of    the conspiracy, about the persons that took part in its    formation, about the objects which they set before    themselves as the object of conspiracy and about. the    manner in which the object of conspiracy is to be                      carried out—all these are matters of inference that    can be drawn from the facts of the case.        ",
      "125. On the other hand, Mr Anisul Huq sub-    mitted that there are sufficient evidence on record in    Support of the charge of criminal conspiracy to com-    mit the murder of the President and his family    members and further the defence having admitted    that there was criminal conspiracy to commit    mutiny and they failing to substantiate its plea, the    appellants could not escape from the charge of    Criminal conspiracy to commit murder, specially in    view of the admission of the appellants that they    have conspired to commit an offence, and the evi-    dence of LD Bashir Ahmed PW 11, ALD Sirajul    Haq PW 12, Dafadar Shafiuddin Sarder PW 13,    Dafader Abdul Jabbar Mridha PW 14, Resalder    Abdul Alim Mollah PW 23, Habilder Md Aminur    Rahman PW 24 Naik Md Yeasin PW 25, Subader    Major Anisul Haque Chowdhury PW 35, Resalder    Munsur Ahmed PW 39, Honourary Lieutenant Syed    Ahmed, PW 40, Colonel Shafayet Jamil PW 44 and    Syed Siddiqur Rahman, Curator of Dhaka Museum    PW 53 proved the charge of criminal conspiracy to    commit murder of the President and his family    members and the learned Judges of the High Cout    Division committed no miscarriage of justice in    maintaining the charge of criminal conspiracy to    commit murder of the President and other members    of his family.        ",
      "124. Regarding conspiracy, the learned Coun-    sels for the appellants argued, the evidence of Lieu-    tenant Colonel Abul Basher BA, PW 7, Lieutenant    Colonel (Retd) Abdul Hamid, PW 9, ALD Sirajul    Hag, PW 12, Habilder Md Aminur Rahman (Retd),    PW 24, Naik Md Yeasin PW 25, Md Reajul Haque,    PW 37, Honorary Lieutenant Syed Ahmed, PW 40,    Colonel Shafayet Jamil PW 44, Major General    Shafiullah, PW 45, Major General Khalilur    Rahman, PW 47, Air Vice-Martial AK Khandaker    PW 48, and Rear Admiral MH Khan PW 49, clearly    relate to conspiracy to commit mutiny and existence    of criminal conspiracy to murder the President and        his family members is absent in the present appeals    but the leaned Judges illegally maintained the con-        viction of the appellants under section 120B of the    Penal Code.        ",
      "123. Similar views have been expressed in the    cases of Metro vs State of UP AIR 1971 SC 1050,    Subeder vs State of UP AIR 1971 SC 125, and Ram        Sanjiwan Singh vs State of Bihar, AIR 1996 SC    3265.        ",
      "122. Besides various decisions of this Divi-    sion on this point, in the case of Hargun Sundar Das     vs State of Maharashtra, AIR 1970 SC 1514 the    Supreme Court of India, while considering the scop¢    of its jurisdiction to assess the evidence in an appeal    ON conviction also observed as follows:    <br>    “We may appropriately repeat what ha    often been Pointed out by this Court under                      Article 136 of the Constitution, this Court does    not normally proceed to review the evidence in    criminal cases unless the trial is Vitiated by    some illegality or material irregularity of    procedure or the trial is held in violation of    rules of natural justice resulting in unfairness to    the accused or the judgment or order under    appeal has resulted in grave miscarriage of    justice. This article reserves to this Court a    special discretionary power to interfere in    suitable cases when for special reasons it    considers that interference is called for in the    larger interest of justice,”        ",
      "121. Article 103(3) is couched in the verbatim    language of Article 136 of the Constitution of India.        ",
      "120. Before considering the above question    and also the fifth grounds i.e. charge of murder, the    scope of Article 103(3) of the Constitution is also to    be considered because to decide the above the    question of facts will invariably come in.        ",
      "119. Now the question is, if the said confes-    sional statements are kept out of consideration    whether the evidence on record merely discloses a    case of conspiracy to commit mutiny to change the    then Government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman or a    conspiracy to commit murder of the President and    his family.        ",
      "118. In view of the legal position QS Stated    above, it appears that the above confessional state-    ments of Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and    Mohiuddin (Artillery) are not relevant fact to prove    the charge of conspiracy framed against the appel-    lants. As stated earlier, the first learned Judge takin g    into consideration the successive remands of the    appellants by passing the provisions of law and non    compliance of provisions of the Code of Criminal    Procedure, did not accept the confessional state.    ments holding that taking the appellants on remand    in connection with other case and “showing the    appellants arrested” without following proper pro-    cedure which according to him was a “device”    adopted by the prosecution.        ",
      "117. But however statement made after the conspiracy has been terminated on achieving its object or it is abandoned or it is frustrated or the conspirator leaves the conspiracy in between, it is not admissible against the co-conspirator. Fixing the period of conspiracy is important as the provisions of Section 10 of the evidence Act would apply only during the existence of the conspiracy.        ",
      "116. Accordingly, once a reasonable ground    exists to believe that two or more persons have    conspired together to commit an offence, anything    said, done or written by one of the conspirators in    reference to the common intention after the common    intention was entertained, is relevant against the    other, not only for the purpose of proving the exis-    tence of the conspiracy but also for proving that the    other person was a party to it. There can be two    objections to the admissibility of evidence under    section 10 of the Evidence Act, Firstly, that the co-    nsplirator whose evidence is sought to be admitted    against the coconspirator is not confronted in Court    by the co-conspirator, and secondly, the prosecution    merely proves the existence of reasonable ground t    believe that two or more Persons have conspired I    commit an offence and that brings into operation the    But however statement made after the        been terminated on Achieving it    bandoned or it is frustrated or the    conspirator leaves the conspiracy \" Mahi ig ner    admissible against the co-consp! '. IXINg the    period of conspiracy is important as PrOVisions    of section 10 of the Evidence Act would apply only    during the existence of the conspiracy.        ",
      "115. Section 10 of the Evidence Act declares    that where there is reasonable ground to band    two or more persons have conspired together to    commit an offence ’    said, done or written by any one of such persons In    reference to their common intention, after the time    when such intention was first entertained by any one    of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the    persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the    purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy    as for the purpose of showing that any such person    was 2 party to it. A plain reading of this section    makes it clear that apart from the act or statement of    the co-conspirator, some prima facie evidence must    exist of the antecedent conspiracy in order to attract    secon 10 Such evidence of a pre-existing cons-    piracy between the appellant and the two Revenue    Officers is conspicuous by its absence in this case.        ",
      "114. Similar views have been expressed in the    case of Zulfigar Ali Bhutto vs State PLD 1979 SC 53    and also in the case of State vs Nalini (1999) 5 SCC    283.In the case of Mogbool Hossain vs State, 12                      DLR SC 217 the case against Moqbool Hussain rested entirely on what the other two accused were alleged to have stated to Tahsilder at the the time of offering the bride money to the Tahsilder for the purpose of mutating his name in the register. At the trail those two accused repudiated their alleged statements.        ",
      "113. On analysing section 10, it has been    observed in Bhagwan Swarup vs State of Maha-    rashtra, AIR 1965 SC 682 as under:    <br>    “Anything so said, done or written is a rele-    vant fact only “as against each of the persons    believed to be so conspiring as well for the pur-    pose of proving the existence of the conspiracy    as for the purpose of showing that any such    person was a party to it”. It can only be used for    the purpose of proving the existence of the    conspiracy or that the other party or for the    purpose of showing that such a person was not    a party to the conspiracy. In short, the section    can be analysed as follows: (1) there shall be a    prima facie evidence affording a reasonable    ground for the Court to believe that two or more    persons are members of the conspiracy; (2) if    the said condition is fulfilled, anything said,    done or written by any one of them in reference    to their common intention will be evidence    against the other; (3) anything said, done or    written by him should have been said, done or    written by him after the intention was formed    by any one of them; (4) it would also be    relevant for the said purpose against another    who entered the conspiracy whether it was said,    done or written before he entered the conspi-    racy or after he left it; and (5) it can only be    used against a co-conspirator and not in his    favour.”        ",
      "112. As it appears the expression ‘in refer-    ence to their common intention’ is very comprehen-    sive and, it appears to have been designedly used to    give a wider scope than the words ‘in furtherance of    the common intention’ used in section 34 of the    Penal Code with the result, anything said, done or    written by a co-conspirator, after the conspiracy was    formed, will be evidence against the other before he    entered the field of conspiracy or after he left it.        ",
      "111. This point was then considered within    Mirza Akbar vs King Emperor, AIR 1940 (PC) 176.    Their Lordships of the Privy Council on conside-    ration of different authorities and section 10 of the    Evidence Act observed as follows:        “This being the principle, their Lordships    think the words of section 10 must be construed    in accordance with it and are not capable of    being widely construed so as to include a state-    ment made by one conspirator in the absence of    the other with reference to past acts done in the    actual course of carrying out the conspiracy,    after it has been completed. The common    intention is in the past. In their Lordships’ judg-    ment, the words “common intention” signifies a    common intention existing at the time when the        thing was said, done or written by one of them.    Things said, done or written while the conspi-    racy was on foot are relevant as evidence of the    common intention, once reasonable ground has    been shown to believe in its existence. But it    would be a very different matter to hold that    any narrative or statement or confession made    to a Third party after the common intention or    conspiracy was no longer operating and had    ceased to exist is admissible against the other    party. There is then no common intention of the    conspirators to which the statement can have    reference. In their Lordships’ judgment section    10 embodies this principle. That is the    construction which has been rightly applied to    section 10 in decisions in India, for instance, in    55 Bom 839 and 38 Cal 169 . In these cases the    distinction was rightly drawn between commu-    nications between conspirators while the cons-    We do not think, for a moment, of        conspiracy was going on with reference to the carry-    ing out of conspiracy and statements made,    after arrest or after the conspiracy has ended, by    way of description of events then past.”        ",
      "110. putting it any higher than the statement of an    accomplice, nor can we in any way allow ourselves    to be influenced by the statements in it, except    where those statements are corroborated by inde-    ondent testimony implicating the accused persons    in the design with which they are charged.”        ",
      "109. Inthe case of Emperor of India vs Abani    Bhusan Chakrabutty, 15 CWN 25, question arose    whether confessions of co-accuseds is a relevant    fact under section 10 of the Evidence Act. In the    above decision the Full Bench observed as follows:  <br>      “ The first piece of evidence we referred a    short time ago. It is argued, on behalf of the        Crown, that statement comes within the provi-        sions of section 10 the Indian Evidence Act, and        is therefore to be treated as evidence against        Abani’s fellow-prisoners. It is said that, if it        does not fall within section 10, at any rate,        under the provisions of section 30, it is a        confession of one of the co-accused and may be        referred to in the course of the trial. It is argued    by Mr Roy with very considerable force, that, in    any case, its value can be no higher than that of    the evidence of an accomplice, and that, indeed,    it is of less value than the evidence of an    accomplice, because an accomplice can be    cross-examined for the purpose of testing his    accuracy, while this confession of Abani made    when he was a prisoner cannot be subject to that    test. There is, of course, very great force in that    argument we have come to the conclusion that    the statement of Abani cannot properly be    treated as evidence under section 10 of the        Evidence Act, that section, in our view, 1s        intended to make evidence communications        between different conspirators while the    conspiracy is going on, with reference to the    carrying out of the conspiracy. No doubt section        10 is wider than the law of England as '0        evidence in case of conspiracy. But we do not        think that section is intended to make evidenence    the confession of a co-accused and put it on the    same footing as a communication passing    between conspirators, or between conspiration    and other persons. with reference to the                      conspiracy. But, with regard to section 30, in    our opinion the statement, being the confession    of a co-accused, can be looked at under that    section. But its value is discounted by the fact    that it cannot be tested by cross-examination,        ",
      "108. Conspiracy means something more than    the joint action of two or more persons to commit an    offence; if it were otherwise, section 10 would be    applicable to any of the offences committed by two    or more persons Jointly and would thus import into    a trial of hearsay evidence which the accused person    would find it impossible to meet. The section is        intended to admit evidence of communications    between different conspirators while the conspiracy    was going on, with reference to the carrying out of    the conspiracy. Now the question Is, whether section    10 is capable of being widely construed SO as to    include a confession made by a conspirator with    reference to past acts done in the actual course of    carrying out the conspiracy after it has been    completed.        ",
      "107. As it appears section 10 of the Evidence    Act will come into play only when the Court is    satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe    that two or more persons have conspired together to    commit an offence or an actionable wrong, that is to    say, there should be a prima facie evidence that a    person was a party to be conspiracy before his act    can be used against his conspirators. Once such a    reasonable ground exists, anything said, done or    written by one of the conspirators in reference to the    common intention, after the said intention was    entertained, is relevant against others, not only for    the purpose of proving the existence of the cons-    piracy but also for proving that the other person was    a party to it. The evidentiary value of the said act is    limited by two circumstances, namely, that the act    shall be in reference to their common intention and    in respect of a period after such period was enter-    tained by any one of them.        ",
      "106. Next question is, whether under section    10 of the Evidence Act the above confessional state-    ments even if found to be true and voluntary are    admissible in evidence against the makers and also    each of the appellants as co-conspirators to prove    the charge of criminal conspiracy after the cessation    of the conspiracy?        ",
      "105. As it appears the confessional statement    of Sultan Shahriar is about his presence in front of    Sherniabat’s house and then at the Radio Station 1st    corroborated by other two confessional statements                          of Syed Farook Rahman and Mohiuddin (artillery).    His statement as regards his subsequent conduct has    been corroborated by PWs 15, 42 and 46 . The con-    fessional statement of Farook Rahman has been    corroborated by the other two confessional state-    ments of Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (artillery).    PWs 1, 4, 11, 12, 15, 21, 42 and 46 corroborated his    statement in material particulars. The confession of    Mohiuddin (artillery) is corroborated by other con-    fessing accuseds in material particulars. His    statement has also been corroborated by PWs 17,    18, 27 and 34, His statement as regards his presence    at the night parade has been corroborated by PWs    11, 21, 22, 24, 25, 29 and 35.        ",
      "104. As to the weight of confessional state-    ment, the view of the superior Courts is that a    confession can be made foundation of a conviction    if it is recorded in accordance with law, found true    and voluntary, inculpatory in nature and if on exami-    nation of the statement as a whole if it is found in    conformity on comparison with the rest of the prose-    cution case. What amount of corroboration could be    necessary in a case would always be a question of    fact to be determined in the light of the circum-    stances of each case. Sometimes no corroborative    evidence are available and the Court can act upon    the confession whether retracted or not, against the    maker, if the confession is found to be true and    voluntary and if it was not obtained by torture,    coercion or inducement. The proper way to    approach a case of this kind is, first to marshall the    evidence against the accused excluding the confes-    sion altogether from consideration and see whether,    if it is believed, a conviction could be based on it. If    it is capable of belief independently, then, of course,    it is not necessary to call the confession in aid.    Where the Court is not prepared to act on the other    evidence, in such an event the Judge may call in aid    the confession and use it to lend assurance to the    other evidence.        ",
      "103. Similar views have been expressed in    Mohd. Hussain Umar vs KS Dalipsinghhi, AIR 1970    SC 45, Ram Prakash ys State of Punjab AIR 1959    SCI, and State vs Fazy Kazi alias Kazi Fazlur    Rahman 29 DLR (SC) 271.        ",
      "101. Regarding the effect of retraction of a    confessional statement, in the case of Joygan Bibi    12 DLR (SC)157, the Supreme Court of Pakistan    observed :        “We are unable to support the proposition    of law laid down by the learned Judges in this    regard. The retraction of a confession is a cir-    cumstance which has no bearing whatsoever    upon the question whether in the first instance it    was voluntarily made, and on the further    question whether it is true. The fact that the    maker of the confession later does not adhere to    it cannot by itself have any effect upon the    findings reached as to whether the confession    was voluntary, and if so, whether it was true, for    to withdraw from a self-accusing statement in    direct face of the consequence of the accusa-    tion, is explicable fully by the proximity of    those consequences, and need have no con-    nection whatsoever with either its voluntary    nature, or the truth of the facts stated. The    learned Judges were perfectly right in first                      deceding these two questions, and the answers    being in  the affirmative, in declaring that the    confession by itself was sufficient, taken with other facts and circumstances, to support    Abdul Majid’s conviction. The retraction of the    confession was wholly immaterial once it Was    and that it was voluntary as well as true, That    being the case, no reason Whatsoever can be    found for the inability felt by the learned Judges    is taking the confession into consideration    “against the co-accused. It is true that if there    were no other evidence against Joygun Bibi    except the confession of Abdul Majid, then, the    confession by itself being merely a matter to be    taken into consideration, and not having the    yality of evidence against Joygun Bibi, it    could rightly be held in law that her conviction    could not be sustained on the confession alone,    The grounds for this conclusion would undoub-    tedly gain weight if the confession were also    retracted. But in the present case, Abdul Majid’s    confession is by no means the only material in    the case to be taken into consideration against    Joygun Bibi. As will be seen presently, the    evidence of the maid-servant Zohura furnished    a very complete and detailed account of the    movements and behaviour of Joygun Bibi on    the night in question, and particularly at and    after the time of the murder. Joygun Bibi has    not offered any explanation in answer to the    questions put to her on the basis of Zohura’s    evidence and Abdul Majid’s confession as to    her behaviour that night. She has been content    to repeat that she is innocent and to suggest that    the case has been fabricated against her by her    husband’s younger brother, Sattar.”        DLR (SC) 598 similar views have been expressed as    follows:        “As for the confessions the High Court, it    appears, was duly conscious of the fact that    retracted confessions, whether judicial or extra-    judicial, could legally be taken into considera-    tion against the maker of those confessions    himself, and if the confessions were found to be    true and voluntary, then there was no need at all    to look for further corroboration. It is now well    Settled that as against the maker himself his        S STATE (Md Tafezzul Islam J)        33    confession, judicial Or extr    retracted or not retr    form the sole basis    Court is satisfied    and Voluntary        a-judicial, Whether    acted, can in law Validly    of his conviction, if the    and believes that it Was true        and was not obtained by torture    OF Coercion or inducement, The question, how-    ever, as to whether in the facts and circum-    stances of a given case the Court should act    upon such a confession alone is an entirely        different question, which relates to the weight        and evidentiary value of the confession and not    to its admissibility in law.”        ",
      "100. However as it appears the first learned    Judge taking into consideration the successive    remands of the appellants and the alleged non com-    pliance of provisions of law, did not accept the    confessional statements holding that taking the    appellants on remand in connection with other cases    without following proper procedure was a “device™    adopted by the prosecution for obtaining the above    confessional statements. From the record, it further    appears that Sultan Shahriar retracted his confession    on Sth February, 1997 after 52 days of his confes-    sion, Farook Rahman retracted his confession on Ist    March, 1993 after 43 days of his confession and    Mohiuddin (artillery) retracted his confession after a    long time more than 30 days of his confession.    There being no explanation on the side of defence    about the delay in filing the applications for    retractions, it can be inferred that the retracting of    these appellants are afterthought devices for nulli-    fying the admissions made in the statements.        ",
      "99. However in Kehar Singh’ case (AIR    ]988 SC 1883) a question arose about the defect in    the procedure in recording the confession of Kehar    Singh wherein it was observed as follows:        “On a consideration of the above decisions        it is manifest that if the provisions of section    164(2) which require that the Magistrate before    recording confession shall explain to the person    making confession that he is not bound to make    a confession and if he does so it may be used as    evidence against him and upon questioning the    person if the Magistrate has reasons to believe    that it is being made voluntarily then the con-    fession will be recorded by the Magistrate. The    compliance of the sub-section (2) of section 164    is therefore, mandatory and imperative and    non-compliance of it renders the confession    inadmissible in evidence. Section 463 (old    section 533 ) of the Code of Criminal Procedure    provides that where the questions and answers    regarding the confession have not been    recorded evidence can be adduced to prove that    in fact, the requirements of sub-section (2) of    section 164 read with section 28] (old section    364) have been complied with. If the Court    comes to a finding that such a compliance had    in fact, been made the mere omission to record    the same in the proper form will not render it    inadmissible evidence and the defect is cured    under section 463 but when there is no-com-    pliance of the mandatory requirement of section    164(2), Criminal Procedure Code and it comes    out in evidence that no such explanation as    envisaged in the aforesaid sub-section has been    given to the accused by the Magistrate, this    substantial defect cannot be cured under section        463 Criminal Procedure Code.”        ",
      "98. This view has been expressed in Moham-    mad Ali vs Emperor, 35 CrLJ 385 (FB) as follows:        “In view of the provisions of the sections    of the Code of Criminal Procedure, particularly    those contained in section 533, Criminal Pro-    cedure Code, it is difficult to say that the    omission to record questions and answers is a    fatal defect, and that it is only by recording such    questions and answers that a confession can    furnish data which enable the Court to arrive at    the conclusion as to the voluntary nature of the    confession. It is equally difficult to hold that    when supplying these data or materials it would    always be “impossible” for the trial Court to    form an estimate as to the voluntary nature of    such confession. The defect no doubt is a gross    irregularity and it may in certain special cases    injure the accused in his defence on the merits,    but barring such cases such a defect is    completely cured by the provisions of section    533 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is                       open to a Court to come to a conclusion from    the internal evidence furnished by the statement    itself or from other evidence that the statement    had been voluntarily made, and the mere fact    that there was an omission to record questions    and answers would not debar the Court from    coming to that conclusion. Nor can it be said    that without these data or materials it is “impos-    sible” for a Court to arrive at the conclusion that    the confession had been made voluntarily.    Where, of course, the defect is not merely one    of recording it in due form and in accordance    with law but there is a defect that the statement    was not duly made at all, the position would be    different.”        ",
      "97. ‘This section provides a mode for the    rectification of an error arising from noncompliance    with any of the provisions of section 164 or section    364, The object is to prevent justice being frustrated    by reason of such non-compliance, If any of the    provisions of this section have not been complied    with by a Magistrate, the confessional statement    may be admitted under this section upon taking    evidence that the statement recorded was duly made,    if non-compliance has not injured the accused to his    defence on the merit. If the record of the confession    or the statement is inadmissible owing to the failure    to comply with any of the provisions of section 164    or section 364, intrinsic evidence, notwithstanding    anything in section 91 of the Evidence Act, may be    given to show that the accused person duly made the    statement and the statement, when so proved may be    admitted and used as evidence of the case, if non-    compliance has not injured the accused. The non-    compliance with the provisions is cured only when    there is no injury caused to the accused as to his    defence on merit.        ",
      "96. Section 533 reads as follows:    <br>    “533 . Non-compliance with provisions of    section 164 or 364(1)—If any Court, before    which a confession or other statement of an    accused person recorded or purporting to be    recorded under section 164 or section 364 is    tendered or has been received in evidence, finds    that any of the provisions of either of such    sections have not been complied with by the    Magistrate recording the statement, it shall take    evidence that such person duly made the    statement recorded; and, notwithstanding any-    thing contained in the Evidence Act, 1872,    section 91, such statement shall be admitted if    the error has not injured the accused as to his    defence on the merits.    <br>    (2) The provisions of this section apply to    Courts of Appeal, Reference and Revision.”        ",
      "95. In the instant particular case only section    533 of the Code is to be considered. The first lear-    ned Judge has mentioned section 537 of the Code in    this regard which has no manner of application in    respect of any error or omission or irregularities that    occurred while recording confessional statement by    Magistrate.        ",
      "94. Chapter XLV of the Code of Criminal    Procedure deals generally with the irregular    proceedings. There are certain irregularities which    do not vitiate the proceedings and these are set out    in section 529, No question of prejudice arises in    this class of cases because the section states cate-    gorically that they shall not vitiate the proceedings.    Certain other irregularities are treated as vital and        there the proceedings are void irrespective of        prejudice. These are set out in section 530 . A Third    class is dealt with in sections $31, 532, 533, 535,    §36(2) and $37 . There broadly speaking the ques-    tion is, Whether the error has caused prejudice to the    accused or has occasioned a failure of justice. The    Code has carefully classified certain kinds of error    and expressly indicates how they have to be dealt    with. In every such case the Court is bound to give    effect to the express commands of the legislature,    there is no scope for further speculation. The only    class of case in which the Courts are free to reach a    decision is that for which no express provision is    made.        ",
      "93. As it appears the object of putting ques-    tions to an accused who offers to confess is to obtain    an assurance of the fact that the confession is not    caused by any inducement, threat or promise having    reference to the charge against him.                      ",
      "92. PW S2 stated that at the time of recor-    ding confession of Mohiuddin (Artillery) he fol-    lowed the procedures provided in section 364 of the    Code and thereafter he issued a certificate and that    after recording his confession, the accused was sent    to jail custody. Mohiuddin (Artillery) also dig Ney    challenge the claim of this witness about FeCordin,    his statement in accordance with the procedure laiq    down by law. PW 52 however, admitted that 1p,    Column No.1 of the Form was blank pw 52    however denied the defence suggestion that Mofy.    uddin (Artillery)did not make any confession to him    or that he signed a statement being prepared by th.    investigating officer or that the signature of thi,    accused was obtained by force in presence of the    police and that the confessional statements were nos    true or voluntary. As it appears in column No.1 o¢    the Form it was mentioned by PW 52 that the Moki.    uddin was produced at 11-00 AM on 271    November, 1996 and his statement was recorded a1    2-00 PM. So the time as well as date of producing    the accused and the time of recording his statement    were duly mentioned. Column Nos. 3 and 4 of the    Form are the instructions and guidelines given to the    Magistrates to follow while recording confessional    statement of an accused. Column No.3 relates to    explaining to the confessing accused each of the    matters mentioned in column 5 and to caution him    to reflect carefully before making the statement.    However, as it appears, the queries required to    confront the accused in column 5 had duly been    confronted in Column No. 6 . The above columns    were duly filled up and so the accused should not    have any grievance in this regard. The defence    suggestion that at the time of recording statement    any police officer was present in his room was    denied Column 8 relates to brief statement of    Magistrate’s reasoning about his satisfaction that the    statement was voluntary. The concerned Magistrate    in his statement stated that the confessional    statement was recorded in accordance with law and    that the accused being satisfied of the correctness of    the statement put his signature. Column 10 contains    the time of forwarding the accused after recording    confession. The concerned Magistrate stated that    after recording statement he forwarded the accused    to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on the same        day with the record.        ",
      "91. PW SI stated that he recorded the con-    fession of Sultan Shahriar after compliance of    formalities required under section 364 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure and explained to the accused    about the contents of his statement and that after    recording statement he issued a certificate about the    correctness of the statement. As it appears appellant    Sultan Shahriar did not challenge this statement of    this witness that he did record his statement in    accordance with section 364 of the Code. PW 51    however admitted that there was no comment in    column No.S of the Form and he gave an explana-    tion that as the accused did not complain to him of    any il] treatment he did not fill up the above column    and this witness denied the defence suggestion that    he recorded the statement of the accused under    duress and torture and that the accused was kept in    wrongful confinement in police custody or that the    statement recorded was not read over to the accused    and that it was not voluntary. PW 51 also stated that        e recorded the statement of Farook Rahman after    compliance of the formalities required under section    364 of the Code and that after recording his    confession the accused was sent to the Court of    Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and the CMM    acknowledged the receipt of the accused on the    same day and that he issued a certificate to the above    effect. Farook Rahman the confessing accused, did    not challenge this claim made by this witness    regarding the recording of his confessional state-    ment in accordance with the provisions required by    law. PW 51 denied the defence suggestion that at the    time of recording his statement an ASP of CID the    investigating officer and other police officers were    present in his room. PW 51 however admitted that    he did not fill up columns 3, 4, 8 and 10 of the Form    but denied the defence suggestion that Faruque    Rahman reported to him about police torture.        ",
      "90. Records show that Sultan Shahriar was    shown arrested in the instant case on 3rd October,    1996 and he was taken on police remand for 7 days    on 30th November, 1996 and then his confessional    statement was recorded and that Farook Rahman    was shown arrested on 3rd October, 1996 in the    instant case and thereafter he was taken on police    remand for 7 days on 12th December, 1996 and then    his confessional statement was recorded on 19th                      December, 1996 and that Mohiuddin (artillery) was    taken on police remand for 7 days on 19th Novem-    ber, 1996 and thereafter he made his confessional    statement on 27th November, 1996.        ",
      "89. Mr Anisul Huq and the learned Attorney-    General, on the other hand, submitted that the first    learned Judge not only misread the materials on    record, but on misconception of law disbelieved the    above confessional statements on the grounds that    before recording the statements the confessing    accuseds were kept in police remand beyond period    as provided in section 167(2) of the Code of Crimi-    nal Procedure by a “device”. The learned Attorney-    General drew our attention to the statement of PW    61 and submitted that the appellant Farook Rahman    was taken on police remand for 13 days on two    occasions in Lalbagh PS Case No.11(11)75 before    the institution of the instant case on 2nd October    1996, and Sultan Shahrior was also taken on 15 days    remand on three occasions in the said case before he    was shown arrested in the instant case on 3rd    October 1996 and accordingly, findings of the first    learned Judge that the confessional statement of    Farook Rahman was in fact, recorded after keeping    him on police remand for 32 days and likewise the    confessional statement of Shahriar was recorded    after keeping him on police remand for 34 days are    not correct.        ",
      "88. Regarding the confessional statements of    the appellants Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and    Mohiuddin (Artillery), the learned Counsel for the    appellants submitted those were procured by torture    and coercion by the police by keeping them on    police remand for a long time and therefore, those    were not voluntary as would be evident from the    reasonings and findings given by first learned Judge    and the second learned Judges erred in law in    accepting these confessions as voluntary and the    Third learned Judge also erred in accepting the    confession of Mohiuddin (Artillery). It was further    urged that since the learned Judges of the Division    Bench were equally divided in their opinion as    regards the confessional statements of Sultan Shah-    riar, Farook Rahman, the Third learned Judge ought    to have considered their confessional statements    also.        ",
      "87. Before discussing the fourth and fifth    grounds i.e. conspiracy and murder, the question as    to whether the confessions made by the appellants    Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin    (Artillery) are legally admissible in evidence are to    be addressed because if those confessional state-    ments are legally admissible in evidence, the state-    ment made therein will be relevant for disposing    both the grounds of conspiracy as well as murder    and if those are found to be not legally admissible,        the prosecution wil] have to prove both the grounds    on the basis of other evidence on record,        ",
      "86. It also appears that in order to avoid con-    troversy, the leamed Sessions Judge was accorded    sanction from the prescribed authority for trial of the    appellants and other accused persons although they    have committed no offence under the Army Act.    Therefore, I find no substance in the objection raised    by the learned Counsels for the appellants regarding    the forum of trial.        ",
      "85. As it appears in the instant appeals there    is nothing on record to show that the army authority    have initiated any proceeding against the appellants    and other accused persons under the Army Act for    violating the direction of the authority. There is also    no evidence that there was collective insubordina-    tion when they committed the killing, The accused    persons were not in ‘active service’ and they have    not committed a civil offence within the meaning of    section §(2) of the Army Act. Therefore, the cri-    minal Court has not acted in excess of jurisdiction in    convicting the appellants.        ",
      "84. As it appears, in the above case, the    appellants were convicted by a General Court Mar-    tial held at Nicosia in Cyprus of the offences of    mutiny. On the night of the incident a noisy outbreak    took place in the barracks—the appellants held a    meeting on the roof of the hotel at which they were    stationed, then came down and acted in riotous    conduct and demolished the barrack’s shop as their    grievances made to the authority were not redressed.    They received an order from a Warrant Officer to    disperse but they did not disperse. The House of    Lords refused to interfere with their conviction on    the reasonings as under:        “I have not thought it necessary to take up    time by going through the evidence in detail.    The Court is quite satisfied that there was    evidence on which the Court Martial could find    on a proper direction that there was a mutiny,    and it is not for us to criticize the finding    provided there was evidence on which they    could come to the decision they did. For the                      reasons which I have endeavoured to state as    shortly as 1 can, the Court is of opinion that    there was no misdirection; that, although per-    haps criticism could be made of the words the    Judge-Advocate used when he made his    interlocutory observation, there was a perfectly    fair direction and nothing was said by the    Judge-Advocate which could have misled the    Court Martial. Therefore, on all these grounds    the appeals should, we think, be dismissed,”        ",
      "83. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the learned    Counsel for the appellant Bazlul Huda, however    referred the case of RV Grant, Davis Riley and    Topley, (1957) 2 All ER 694.        ",
      "82. As it appears, this case has no manner of    application in the facts and circumstances of the    instant case.        ",
      "81. In the case of Jamil Huq relied on by the    appellants, the writ petitioners were tried and    convicted by the Court Martial under the Army Act    1952 for the offence of mutiny that took place in the    night following 29th March, 1981 which resulted in    the death of Ziaur Rahman, the then President of    Bangladesh. They filed writ petitions challenging    the decision of the Court Martial constituted under,    the Army Act. The High Court summarily rejected    the writ petitions. The Appellate Division in the    facts of the given case observed “if the Court Mar-    tial is constituted properly and the offence commit-    ted is cognizable by it then the rest is a question of    fact based on evidence which is held by all the    authorities that the writ jurisdiction is not available    to interfere. This Court is only concerned to    examine the question whether the jurisdiction under    Article 102 has been conferred and once it comes to    the conclusion that the jurisdiction has not been    conferred there is the end of the matter.”        ",
      "80. In the case of Major EG Barsay vs State    of Bombay, AIR 1961 SC 1762 it was observed by    Subha Rao, J as follows:        “The scheme of the Act therefore is self-    evident. It applies to offences committed by    army personnel described in section 2 of the    Act; it creates new offences with specified    punishments, imposes higher punishments to    preexisting offences, and enables civil offences    by a fiction to be treated as offence under the    Act; it provides satisfactory machinery for    resolving the conflict of jurisdiction. Further it    enables, subject to certain conditions an    accused to be tried successively both by Court    Martial and by a criminal Court. It does not    expressly bar the jurisdiction of criminal Courts    in respect of acts or omissions punishable under    the Act, if they are also punishable under any    other law in force in India; nor is it possible to    infer any prohibition by necessary implication,    Sections 125, 126 and 127 exclude any such    inference, they, in express terms, provide not    only for resolving conflict of jurisdiction bet-    ween a criminal Court.and a Court Martial in    respect of a same offence, but also provide for    successive trials of an accused in respect of the    same offence.”        ",
      "79. In Joginder Singh vs State of Himachal    Pradesh, AIR 1971 SC 500, the Supreme Court    observed:        “It is further clear that in respect of an    offence which could be tried both by a criminal    Court as well as a Court Martial, sections 125,    126 and the Rules have made suitable provi-    sions to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction between    the ordinary criminal Courts and the Court    Martial, But it is to be noted that in the first    instance, discretion is left to the officer men-    tioned in section 125 to decide before which                       Court the proceedings should be instituted.    Hence the officer commanding the army, army    corps, division or independent brigade in which    the accused person is serving or such other    officer as may be prescribed will have to    exercise his discretion and decide under section    125 in which Court the proceedings shall be    instituted. It is only when he so exercises his    discretion and decides that the proceeding    should be instituted before a Court Martial, that    the provisions of section 126(1) come into    operation. If the designated officer does not    exercise his discretion and decides that the pro-    ceedings should be instituted before a Court    Martial, the Army Act would not obviously be    in the way of a criminal Court exercising its    ordinary jurisdiction in the manner provided by    law.”        ",
      "78. In Balbir Singh vs State of Punjab    (1995) 1 SCC 90 the Supreme Court of India obser-    ved:        “When a criminal Court and Court Martial    each have jurisdiction in respect of the trial of    the offence, it shall be in the discretion of the    officer commanding the group, wing or station    in which the accused is serving or such other    officer as may be prescribed, in the first    instance, to decide before which Court the pro-    ceedings shall be instituted and if that officer    decides that they should be instituted before a    “Court Martial”, to direct that the accused    persons shall be detained in Air Force custody.    Thus, the option to try a person subject to the    Air Force Act who commits an offence while on    “active service” is in the first instance with the    Air Force Authorities. The criminal Court,    when such an accused is brought before it shall    not proceed to try such a person or to inquire    with a view to his commitment for trial and    shall give a notice to the Commanding Officer    of the accused, to decide whether they would    like to try the accused by a Court Martial or    allow the criminal Court to proceed with the    trial. In case, the Air Force Authorities decide    either not to try such a person by a Court    Martial or fail to exercise the option when    intimated by a criminal Court within the period    prescribed by Rule 4 of the 1952 Rules, the    accused can be tried by the ordinary criminal    Court in accordance with the Code of Criminal    Procedure.”        ",
      "77. It may be mentioned here that sections    125 and 126 of the Army Act 1950 as applicable to        MAJOR BAZLUL Hupa vg State (Md Tafeezl Islam J) 27        India and sections 94 and 95 of the Army Act, 1952    are in verbatim language.        ",
      "16. Section 139 of the Penal Code is inclu-    ded in chapter VII Which contains sections 131-140.    it appears section 131 provides for abetting    mutiny OF attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or    airman from his duty, section 132 provides for abet-    ment of mutiny, if mutiny is committed in conse-    quence thereot and other Sections are relating to    abetment of other offences and section 139 prohibits    unishment of any person under the provisions of    penal Code who is subject to the Army Act, 1952,    the Navy Ordinance, 1961, the Air Force Act 1953    for any of the offences or the abetment of those    offences mentioned in sections 131 to 138 . Thus    section 139 of the Penal Code has no application in    the present appeals in view of the fact that the    appellants have been tried and convicted not for    committing an offence of abetment of mutiny but for    substantive offences of criminal conspiracy and    murder. Regarding section 549 of the Code, it    appears that it is of a special nature and has the    result of taking away the jurisdiction of criminal    Court with respect to persons subject to military,    naval and air force law. The expressions “‘is liable to    be tried either by a Court to which this Code applies    or by a Court Martial” used in this section implies    that the offence for which the offender is to be tried    should be an offence of which cognizance can be    taken by a Criminal Court as well as a Court Mar-    tial. The phrase is intended to refer to the initial    jurisdiction of the two Courts to take cognizance of    the offence and not to their jurisdiction to decide it    on merits. In respect of offences which could be    tried by both the Criminal Court as well as a Court    Martial, sections 94 and 95 of the Army Act have    made suitable provisions to avoid a conflict of        jurisdiction between those two Courts as discussed    above.        ",
      "75. The learned Counsels for the appellants    also contended that in view of section 139 of the    penal Code and section 549 of the Code of Criminal    procedure the trial of the appellants by a criminal    Court 1st barred.        ",
      "74. [am also in agreement with the submis-    sion of Mr Tawfique Nawaz that in view of the position                       of the then President as provided in the Cons.    jitution, merely because of one single Act i.e. Army    Act 1952, and for being “commander in chief” the    late president cannot be regarded as army personnel,        ",
      "73.  In terms of the relevant provisions of law    as above, if the appellants being not in ‘active    service’ commit a ‘civil offence’, the provisions of    Army Act does not stand on the way for their trial by    a criminal Court. Further sections 94 and 95 have    also been included in chapter IX of the Army Act    1952 for trial of ‘civil offence’ by an ordinary    criminal Court. Section 94 presupposes that both a    criminal Court and Court Martial have jurisdiction    concurrently in respect of an act or omission punish-    able both under the Army Act or in case of an    offence deemed to be an offence under the Army Act    as well as under any law in force and the same will    also be under scheme of those two provisions, in the    first instance, it is left to the discretion of the    prescribed officer to decide before which Court the    proceedings shall be instituted and, if the prescribed    officer decides that the case should be instituted    before a Court Martial, the offender is to be detained    in military ‘custody. However, at the same time if a    criminal Court is of opinion that the said offence    shall be tried before the said Court, he may issue    notice under section 95 either to deliver over the    offender to the nearest Magistrate or to postpone the    proceedings pending a reference to the Government    and upon receipt of the requisition the prescribed    officer may either deliver over the offender to the    said Court or refer the question to the Government    for determination as to whose order shall be final.        ",
      "71. The term ‘active service’ has been    defined in section 8(1) as under:        “active service”, as applied to a person    subject to this Act, means the time during which    such person is attached to, or forms part of a    force which is engaged in operations against an    enemy, or is engaged in military operations in,        vs STATE (Md Tafa Islam J        on the line of march to a country or place    wholly or partly occupied by an enemy, or    attached to or forms part of a force which is in military occupation of a foreign country:        or        There is no allegation against the appel-    accused persons to the effect that    while they were in “active service” committed the    offence of murder and the appellants also did not    claim that the incident was committed while they    were on “active service”. There is also no material    on record to show that the incident was committed    while the appellants were engaged in operation    against an enemy OF that they were engaged in    military operation or on the line of march to a    country or place wholly or partly occupied by an    enemy.    ",
      "70. As it appears section 59(1) of the Army    Act 1952 provides that subject to the provisions of    sub-section (2), any person subject to the Army Act    who at any place commits a civil offence shall be    deemed to be guilty of an offence under the Army    Act and “Civil offence’ defined in section 8(2) Army    Act means an offence which, if committed in Bangla-    desh, would be triable by a criminal Court. There-    fore, there is no dispute that if the acts of the    appellants come within the mischief of ‘civil    offence’ there is no legal bar for the trial of the    appellants by a criminal Court constituted under the    Code however, section 59(2) of the Army Act    stipulates that person who is subject to Army Act    commits murder against any person not subject to    the Army Act shall not be liable to prosecution    under the Army Act unless he commits the offence    while on active service.        ",
      "35. In this Ordinance, mutiny means a    combination between two or more persons    subject to service law, or between persons two    at least of whom are subject to service law—    <br>    (a) to overthrow or resist lawful authority    in the armed forces of Bangladesh or any forces    co-operating therewith or in any part of any of    the said forces;    <br>    (b) to disobey such authority in such cir-    cumstances as to make the disobedience sub-    versive of discipline, or with the object of    avoiding any duty or service, or in connection    with operations against the enemy; or    <br>    (c) to impede the performance of any duty    or service in the armed forces of Bangladesh or    in any forces co-operating therewith, or in any    part of any of the said forces.”    <br>    There is no dispute that this definition of    mutiny is applicable in the Army Act, 1952 in view    of the definition of ‘service law’ given in section    4(xxxiv), of the Navy Ordinance, 1961 which    provides that “service law” means this Ordinance,    the Army Act, 1952, the Air Force Act, 1953, and the    rules and regulations made thereunder.              ",
      "67. By the above suggestions as given to the    witnesses the appellants termed the incident as a    successful military coup d’etat and that the Govern-    ments protected and rewarded them by declaring    them as ‘Surya Santan’ and the appellants did not try    to make out a case of mutiny and further they, in    their statements under section 342, were conspi-    cuously silent on this point and they changed their    stand at the appellate stage in the High Court    Division although there is no material in support of    the plea. Though in the Army Act, 1952, the defi-    nition of mutiny has not been given but the    punishment for the mutiny has been provided in    section 31 of the Army Act 1952 . Mutiny has been    defined in section 35 of the Navy Ordinance, 1961,    which reads thus :        ",
      "66. However, as it appears as per provisions    of the Constitution, after the killing of the President,    the then Vice-President ought to have assumed the    office as President but this time this constitutional        rovisions were ignored. Further, if there was a    mutiny, the officers and jawans involved in the    incident should have been put on trial for mutiny    under the Army Act by the Government in power    but no such action was taken, rather the killers were    rewarded by the Government. Md Reajul Haque    Pw 37), a employee of Radio Station, stated in    chief that at about 9-00 AM the chiefs of three    services aS well as the BDR chief and the IGP of    Police were brought by Major Dalim at Studio No.2    and their statements of allegiance in favour of the    change were recorded and broadcast. On behalf of    Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid it was    suggested to Major General Shafiullah (PW 45) that    there was a successful military insurrection in the    morming of 15th August, 1975 and in the said    insurrection Khondker Mustaque Ahmed assumed    the power of President, that all the chiefs of the    defence services expressed their allegiance and that    he did not take any action against the persons    involved in the incident and that Khandaker    Mustague declared the killers as ‘7 a1”. In reply    to a question on behalf of Farook Rahman, Colonel    Shafayet Jamil (PW 44) stated that it was not    possible to take any action against the killers of 15th    August as the persons involved in the killing of 15th    August were given protection by the subsequent    Governments and favoured them and that the    conspirators and killers of 15th August used to stay    at Bangabhaban and that they run the Mustaque    Government by constituting a Revolutionary    Council.        ",
      "65. As it appears the defence did not take    any plea of “mutiny” while cross-examining or    giving suggestions to the prosecution witnesses.    Since the prosecution witnesses did not say anything    in support of the defence plea of mutiny, the defence    ought to have suggested to the prosecution witnes-    ses that the involved officers and jawans in the    mutiny submitted their charter of demands and as    their demands were not acceded to, they killed the    President but on the contrary it was suggested to PW    24 on behalf of Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook    Rahman that at that time when Major Dalim was    broadcasting the news of the killing, PW 24, had    knowledge about declaration of Martial Law and                      that Khondker Mustaque Ahmed became the Chief    Martial Law Administrator. From this suggestion    the defence Wanted to make out a case that after the    killing of the President, Martial Law was declared    ; Khondker Mustaque Ahmed became the Presi-    dent and the Chief Martial Law Administrator of the    country and by this suggestion the defence wanted    to make out a case that since the killing was the    consequence of a successfull army insurrection, such    killing would not constitute an offence of murder.        ",
      "64. Mr Tawfique Nawaz, the learned Coun-    sel for the State, submitted that the entire scheme of    the constitutional and legal personality of the Presi-    dent as was provided in some 59 Articles of the    Constitution which were in force at the time of the    killing of the then President are very explicit and    accordingly, the legal personality and the status,    functions and immunities as enjoyed by the then    President under the Constitution is to be considered    on the basis of constitutional provisions instead of    merely considering his position merely on the basis    of one single Act i.e. Army Act 1952 or a provision    therein for treating him as “army personnel” for    being the “commander in chief” and accordingly the    trial of the appellants by criminal Court instead of    Court Martial was lawful.        ",
      "63. Mr Anisul Hug, on the other hand, con-    tended that the incident is not a mutiny, rather it is a    preplanned murder and therefore, there is no legal    bar for the trial of the appellants under the provi-    sions of the Code of Criminal Procedure as would        Mason Bazin Huns vs STATE (Md Teferced Islam J)        appear from the provisions of sections 59, 92, 94    and 95 of the Army Act 1952, section 35 of the Navy    Ordinance 1961 and section 549 of the Code of C53.    minal Procedure. Learned Attorney-General endor.    sing the above submissions of Mr Hug added thay    the appellants did not raise this point in the triay    Court and raised it for the first time in the High    Court Division with malafide motive in order to    confuse the Court and further the evidence on record    do not support a case of mutiny and rather disclosed    a case of murder and accordingly, charges against    the appellants were duly framed and even if it is    assumed the incident is a ‘civil offence’ within the    meaning of section 8(2) read with section 59(2) of    the Army Act, in view of section 94 of the Army Act    the Criminal Court has concurrent jurisdiction to try    such offence.        ",
      "62. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman further submit-    ted that the instant incident originated from Dhaka    Cantonment on the night of 14th August from which    it is apparent that it was a mutiny simpliciter and    further there was also no agreement or criminal cons-        piracy or premeditated plan or pre-arranged plan,    within the meaning of section 34 or section 120A of        the Penal Code. The learned Counsel further argued    even if when any retired army officer or any other    person not subject to Army Act joined in the    occurrence on the night following 14th August,    1975 would also constitute a mutiny within the    ambit of section 31 of the Army Act and accord-    ingly, they also ought to have been tried by a Court    Martial under the Army Act and moreover, there is    similarity in the killings of the President as in the    present appeals and General Ziaur Rahman as in    hoth the cases they were Presidents of the Republic    and they were killed by the army personnel and in    the present appeals the officers and jawans army    from artillery and lancer units came out from Dhaka    Cantonment and killed the President at dawn on    15th August, 1975 at his official residence, whereas,    in case of Genera] Ziaur Rahman the army came out    from Chittagong Cantonment and killed him at Cir-    cuit House where he was staying on the night    following 29th May, 1981 and since both the occur-    rences were committed in similar manner, the    appellants, if they were at all involved in the    incident of 15th August, ought to have been tried by    a Court-Martial as was done in case of General    Ziaur Rahman. Further, the President, being the    commander-in-chief of the armed forces, for his    killing, trial ought to have been held before Court    Martial. In support of this contention the learned    Counsel has referred the case of Jamil Huq vs        Bangladesh, 34 DLR (SC) 125.        ",
      "61. Solam of the view that the delay being    reasonably explained, no interference is called from    this Division. Regarding the Third ground, i.e.    Mutiny, the leamed Counsels for the appellants    made common submission that the evidence on    record revealed that the killing of the President and    the members of his family and the change of power    on 15th August, 1975 was a result of mutiny by    some army officers and therefore the trial ought to    have been held by Court Martial under the    provisions of Army Act, 1952 and accordingly the    trial of the appellants under the provision of the    Code of Criminal Procedure was without juridiction                       and in support of this submission sections    31(a), 59(3), 92(2), 94 and 95 of the Army Act,    sections § and 139 of the Penal Code and section    594(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure were    referred.        ",
      "60. It seems to me the learned Judges have    given cogent reasons in believing the explanation of    delay given by the prosecution. Further this being a    finding of fact based on evidence on record, the    scope of this Division to interfere under Article    103(3) of the Constitution is very limited.        ",
      "59. The criminal justice system in a country    is designed to protect the citizens of the country    from the onslaught of criminal activities of a section    of people who indulges in such acts. State as a    guardian of fundamental rights of its citizens is duty    bound to ensure the administration of justice and the    rule of law. It is in the interest of the people that the    guilt of the offender who has indulged in criminal    activity is determined as quickly as possible. But,    unfortunately, this concept has been ignored after    killing of the then President of the country and other    members of his family. In order to have a strong    socio-economic system, it is important that each and    every offender involved in crime should be put to    justice and his trial should move at reasonably fast    pace. The challenges before the criminal justice    system are to balance the rights of the citizen as well    as of the accused while dispensing speedy and    effective justice in order to ensure a welfare state for    its citizens. Rule of law is meaningless unless there    is access to justice for the common people.        ",
      "58. The above submissions have substance    as justice is related to law and justice differs from    benevolence, generosity, gratitude, friendship and    compassion and justice consists of maintaining the    societal sfatus quo and further the concept of    impartiality is at the core of the system of criminal    justice. Further, a Government is not of men but of    laws. When law ends tyranny begins. Law is the    very antithesis of arbitrary power. Further, among    different types of felonies, an offence of murder or    an order to commit murder is obviously illegal and    immoral and that is why the Nazis never tried to    legalise genocide and the orders to kill the concen-    tration camp inmates were always couched in veiled    terms and even the Nazis recognised that such    conduct could never be justified in terms of any    system of law.        ",
      "57. The leamed Attorney-General and Mr    Azmalul Hossain expressing their concern about the    mode of dispensation of justice by the then Govern-    ments in power submitted that the justice delivery    system has failed in all respects during the relevant    time which cannot be exonerated and this failure of    the justice delivery system has colossal and    catastrophic affect in the country which should not    be allowed to recur for the interest of the country.    This, according Mr Hossain, is a part of the history    that cannot be erased—the entire administration,    from top to the bottom, failed to perform their res-    ponsibilities which will be termed as a scandalous    chapter in our history and this sort of practice should        be stopped forever and it should not be allowed to    repeat again.        ",
      "56. Further as the law stands, if no case was    instituted against the killers of the elected President    of the country by anyone on behalf of the victims,    the Government “according to law” was under obli-    gations to institute a case, specially when an elected    President was brutally killed along with his family    and further, the appellants along with other accuseds    not only committed an offence of murder, they also    committed atrocities against humanity by killing a    child and three innocent women. Further, the above    offence of murder being a cognizable offence, if no    FIR was lodged on behalf of the victims for such an    offence, the officer-in-charge of the Dhanmondi    Police Station was under an obligation to hold    investigation into the offence without an order of a    Magistrate and to submit his report under section    173 of the Code.        ",
      "55. Admittedly, the then President and all    other members of his family found in the house    were brutally killed. Had the Government in power    had not supported the above killing, it was the    bounden duty of the Governments in power 10    institute a case for ascertaining the cause for the    death and bring the killers to justice but, in this    particular case, the process of law has not been    allowed to take its own course, rather by promul-    gating Indemnity Ordinance 1975 the Government    in power wanted to protect the accuseds including        |                      the appellants and further, though some of them    were initially removed army officers, they were also    absorbed in the Foreign Ministry and were    appointed in the Foreign Missions.        ",
      "54. Further, as Lieutenant Colonel Shafayat    Jamil (PW 44) stated in his deposition, the appellant    Farook Rahman and condemned convict Major    Rashid always stayed in the Bangabhaban and their    accomplice officers stayed in the Radio Station and    used to maintain contact among them by constitu-    ting an unwritten Revolutionary Command Council    and ruled the country under the leadership of    Khondker Mustaque Ahmed and that it was not    possible for taking legal action against the killers of    15th August as the killers were being given    protection by the Governments in power after the        incident till 1996.        ",
      "53. Further, as it appears, after the incident    Khondker Mustaque Ahmed usurped the power and    proclaimed Martial Law on 20th August, 1975 and    assumed the office of the President of Bangladesh    with retrospective effect from 15th August, 1975    and then he promulgated the Indemnity Ordinance,    1975 on 26th September, 1975 putting restriction on    taking of any legal or other proceedings against    persons in respect of certain acts, things, committed    by those persons in connection with, or in prepa-    ration or execution of any plan for, or necessary    steps towards the change of the Government of    Bangladesh. As it appears whether or not an FIR    could have been lodged even after the promulgation    of the said Ordinance was a matter of interpretation    of law and further the above Ordinance has also        made psychological impact.        ",
      "52. In the present case the informant in the    FIR has implicated only 14 accused persons in the    FIR and out of them he made specific allegation of    overt act only against Bazlul Huda and identified    three other accused persons and implicated rest of    the accused persons from the informations collected        from other sources. If the informant had il] motive to    implicate and/or embellish facts against the appel-    lants and other accused persons, he could have    vividly mentioned in the FIR the role played by each    accused person, but he did not resort to that path and this shows that this FIR is the true version what the informant has seen at the place of occurrence ang    whatever evidence that have been collected againt,    the appellants and other accused persons about their    complicity by the investigating agency were in the    course of the investigation of the case.        ",
      "51. However, as observed in the case of    Shreekantthia (supra) the delay in lodging the first    information report puts the Court on guard to search    for and consider if any explanation has been offered    for the delay. Once it is offered, the Court is to only    see whether it is satisfactory or not. In case the    prosecution fails to explain the delay satisfactorily    and there is possibility of embellishment or    exaggeration in the prosecution version on account    of such delay then this possibility becomes a rele-    vant factor. On the other hand, satisfactory expla-    nation of the delay is enough to reject the plea of    false implication or vulnerability of the prosecution    case.        ",
      "50. It is true delay in lodging the FIR some-    times results to embellishment by creature of after-    thoughts. But the consistent views of the Superior    Courts are that mere delay in lodging a case is not a    cround for disbelieving a prosecution case, for there    are various circumstances in which lodging any case        as to the commission of offence may be delayed.        ",
      "48. The second learned Judge observed:    <br>    “In this case from the evidence of PW 44    and other witnesses, the most accused persons    used to stay in Banga Bhaban since 15th    August, 1975 and in the name of an unwritten    command council used to govern the country    till they were made to leave on the 4th Novem-    ber, 1975 . Still though they were not without    influence. The accused Major Syed Farook    Rahman tried to force a mutiny at Savar and    Bogra Cantonments and the accused Major    Khondker Abdur Rashid tried unsuccessfully to    take over the command of 2nd Field Artillery    Regiment in 1976, Again in 1980 they made    another attempt to overthrow the Government    but still no Government took any punitive    action against any of them; rather they were all    given their arrear salaries. The accused Major                       Syed Farook Rahman even contested the Pre-    sidential election in 1986 (PW 44), So the appre    hension of the informant about his life and limb    cannot be said to be unreasonable. Under such    circumstances, the delay in lodging the PIR    cannot vitiate the trial, after all it is always for    prove its case on evidence, as the prosecution to    Counsel such, and the contention of the learned    on behalf of the appellants about the delay in        lodging the FIR has got no substance.”                ",
      "47. The first learned Judge observed:        “In the present case delay in lodging the    FIR has sufficiently been explained and in view    of the matter the contention that FIR has been    lodged after lapse of several years change of    manipulation and false implication can all    together to be not ruled out merits no consi-    deration.”        ",
      "46. Mr Anisul Huq, and the learned Attor-    ney-General, on the other hand, submitted that the    prosecution not only had explained the reasons but    qalso demonstrated cogent evidence to substantiate    WNthe cause for delay in lodging the FIR and the    inability of the informant to lodge the FIR after the    <occurrence due to the fact that the successive    op Governments expressly as well as impliedly pre-    vented the institution of the case against the appel-    lants and other accused persons by promulgating    Indemnity Ordinance 1975 and protected the    appellants and other accuseds persons as would be    evident from the fact that after the incidents the    appellants and other accuseds not only remained    under the shelter of the then governments but also    held influential and powerful positions and Major    Rashid contested the general election in 1996 who    along with Farook Rahman floated a political party    under the name “Freedom Party” and Farook    Rahman also contested the election in 1980, and    Bazlul Huda was the Secretary of the “Freedom    Party” and further after General Ziaur Rahman came    to power he rewarded most of the accused persons        21 involved in the killing of the President and his        family by appointing them in foreign missions, even        they openly declared themselves as killers of the        then President and his family and that this being an        exceptional case in which then successive Govern-        ments sheltered and protected the accused persons        including the appellants, the informant was    apprehensive of his life by taking risk of filing any    case till the Bangladesh Awami League came into    power in the year 1996 . In support of the above    submissions the learned Counsels for the State    referred the cases of State vs Fazal, 39 DLR (AD)    166, Md Shamsuddin @ Lalu vs State, 40 DLR (AD)    69, Tara Singh vs State of Punjab 1991 Supp (1)    SCC 536, Jamna vs State of UP 1994 Supp(1) SCC    185 and State of HP vs Shreekanthia Shekari (2004)    8 SCC 153 . As it appears the learned Judges of the    High Court Division believed the explanation for    delay and observed that the prosecution has been    able to explain the delay by assigning cogent reason.        ",
      "45. Lamof the view that the above judgment    and order of the Third learned Judge is absolutely in    accordance with the provision of sections 378 and    429 of the Code. Regarding the second ground i.e.    delay, the leamed Counsels for the appellants    submitted that there is inordinate delay in lodging    the FIR and this unreasonable delay of 21 years    enabled the prosecution to introduce concocted    story for implicating the appellants and other    accuseds falsely by collecting manipulated evidence    which caused prejudice to the appellants and further    even if it is assumed that this delay has been caused    due to the promulgation of the Indemnity Ordi-    nance, 1975 but there is no explanation for about    three months from 26-6-1996, i.e. the date after    Awami League came to power.        ",
      "44. Then followed the judgment and order    dated 30th April, 2001 of the High Court Division    maintaining the conviction and sentence in respect    of three condemned prisoners including the appel-    lant Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) and accepting    their death reference and disposing the death    reference which is as follows:        “In the result, Death Reference No.30 of    1998 so far as it relates to Lieutenant Colonel    Syed Farook Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Lieutenant    Colonel Khandker Abdur Rashid, Major Md    Bazlul Huda, Lieutenant Colonel Shariful    Hoque Dalim, BU Lieutenant Colonel AM    Rashed Chowdhury, Lieutenant Colonel AKM    Mohiuddin (Lancer), Lieutenant Colonel    SHBM Nur ‘Chowdhury, Lieutenant Colonel    Md Aziz Pasha, Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin    Ahmed (Artillery), Resalder Moslemuddin @    Moslehuddin and Captain Abdul Mazed is    accepted confirming the death sentence and    accordingly, Criminal Appeal No.2616 of 1998    filed by accused Lieutenant Colonel Syed    Farook Rahman, Criminal Appeal No.2604 of    1998 filed by accused Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Criminal Appeal    No. 2613 of 1998 filed by accused Major Md    Bazlul Huda and Criminal Appeal No.2617 of    1998 filed by Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin    Ahmed (Artillery) are dismissed but Death                          Reference No.30 of 1998 so far it relates to    accused Captain Md Kismat Hashem, Major    Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful Islam and    Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar is rejected and    the conviction and the sentence of these    accused are accordingly set aside and thereby    acquitting them of the charges levelled against    them in this case.”        ",
      "43. As it appears the appellants did not take    any exception to the aforesaid order of the Third    learned Judge and the learned Counsels on their    behalf then argued the appeals and the death    reference. Then the Third Jearned Judge, after    hearing, gave opinion as follows:        “In view of the discussions, reasons and    findings above in the body of this judgment, in    my opinion, accused Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-    uddin Ahmed (Artillery), Captain Abdul Mazed    and Resalder Moslemuddin @ Muslehuddin    were rightly convicted under sections 120B and    302/34 PC and sentenced to death under    sections 302/34 Penal Code by the learned    Sessions Judge, Dhaka and agreeing with my    learned brother ABM Khairul Hoque, J the        Death Reference, so far as it relates to Lieu-    tenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery),        Captain Abdul Mazed and Resalder Moslem.    uddin @ Moslehuddin, is accepted and the    Criminal Appeal No.2617 of 1998 filed by    accused Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Artillery) is dismissed but the conviction and    sentence of accused Captain Md Kismat    Hashem, Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and    Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful    Islam passed by the learned Session Judge,    Dhaka in Sessions case No.319/97 are liable to    be set aside and the same are accordingly set    aside and accordingly, agreeing with my    brother Md Ruhul Amin J, the Death Reference    so far as it relates to Captain Md Kismat    Hashem, Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and    Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful    Islam is rejected.”        ",
      "42. Thereafter, the appellants filed applica-    tions before the Third leamed Judge praying for    hearing the death reference in respect of all the con-    demned prisoners for ends of justice and the Third    learned Judge, after hearing heard the learned    Counsel at length, by order dated 6th February, 2001    rejected the application on the following reasons:        “In view of the discussion above and    equally divided opinion of the learned Judges of    the Division Bench, | am of the opinion that the    cases of above 9 condemned prisoners over    whom the learned Judges not being divided in    opinion are not contemplated to be heard both    under the provisions of sections 378 and 429,    CrPC. But only the case of accused Abdul    Majed over whom there is difference as regards    the conviction under the two separate sections    of the Penal Code and cases of those 5 other    condemned prisoners over which the learned    Judges are equally divided in opinion i.e.    convicted by one learned Judge and acquitted    by another learned Judge, are before this Court    for an opinion. Upon delivery of the opinion by    this Court, the judgment and order shall follow    such opinion in order to dispose of the entire    death reference.”        ",
      "41. Regarding the submission made in    respect of “judgment” it appears that in view of the    difference of opinion as regards conviction of 6    accused persons the Division Bench by order dated    14th December, 2000 passed the following order:    <br>    “Death Reference accepted in part, CrlA    2604 of 1998, 2613 of 1998, and 2616 of 1998    ‘are dismissed. CrlA 2617 of 1998 is allowed by    Mr Justice Md Ruhul Amin by judgment in    separate sheets. BO Death Reference accepted    in part, CrlA 2604 of 1998, 2613 of 1998, 2616    of 1998 and 2617 of 1998 are dismissed by Mr    Justice ABM Khairul Haque vide judgment in    separate sheets.”        BO “14-12-2000 . As the judgment in Death    Reference No, 30 of 1998 is split one, let the    matter, as per provision of section 378 of the    Code of Criminal Procedure be placed before                       the learned Chief Justice for necessary orders,    Md Ruhul Amin ABM Khairal Haque, JJ.        ",
      "40. Further, even if it is assumed that the        Third learned Judge ought to have heard the        reference in respect of all the convicts, as we have    heard the appeals of the appellants at length on merit    as was done in Sajjan Singhs case (supra), the    appellants could not be said to have been prejudiced.        ",
      "39. As it appears the views taken by five-        member constitution bench of the Indian Supreme    Court in Babu'’s case (AIR 1965 SC 1467), holds the    field on the point and the said decision has been        followed in later cases as well and this is no cogent        ground to depart from those views as they are based    on correct construction of the provisions of law.        ",
      "38. In the case of Abdur Raziq vs State 16        DLR (WP) 73 it was observed that—  <br>      “there is nowhere laid down in sections    378 and 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code,    that the Third Judge should follow or may    follow the opinion of the Judge who has given    his opinion favouring the accused.” But    however if this proposition is accepted, then    there would have been no necessity in using the    expressions “such Judge, after such hearing as    he thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the    judgment or order shall follow such opinion” in    section 378 of the Code.        ",
      "37. As it appears in the case of Muhammad    Shafi vs Crown, 6 DLR (WP) 104 (FB) as referred by    the appellants, the learned Judges agreed with the    contention that “the Third Judge was exercising the    authority of a Bench of Judges and that, therefore,    he should consider for the purposes of section 12 of    the Sind Courts Act not as a single Judge, but as a    Bench”. | am of the view that the above case has no    manner of application in this case.        ",
      "36. Inthe case Bhagat Ram vs State of Raj-    sthan AIR 1972 SC 1502 the appeal filed by the    State against the acquittal of two accuseds B and R    of offences under sections 120B, 218, 347, 389    Penal Code is dismissed but there being difference    of opinion between the Judges of the Division    Bench as regards the correctness of the order of    acquittal of B in respect of offence under section    161, Penal Code and section 5(1)(a), Prevention of    Corruption Act and then the matter was referred to a    Third Judge under section 429, CrPC and the    Supreme Court of India, in view of above position    observed that it is not open to the Third Judge to    reopen the matter of acquittal of B in respect of    offences under sections 120B, 218, 347 for which an    express order had been made by the Division Bench    upholding the order of acquittal of the trial Judge    and that since the whole case had not been referred    under section 429 CrPC the Third Judge could go    only into the point of difference and arrive at his    conclusion.        ",
      "35. Similar view finds support in the case of    Nemai Mondal vs State of West Bengal AIR 1966    Cal 194 where it was held that “The case with the    differing opinion is placed before the Third J udge. It    is the duty of the Third Judge to decide the case and    not merely the points on which two Judges have    differed.        ",
      "34. ‘In the case of the State vs Abdul Khair    (supra) out of 3 accuseds, one committed the mur-    der and two others were standing with the motor-    bikes and convicted under sections 302/34 PC, But    in a split judgment on appeal, one Jearned Judge    acquitted two others. The Third Judge on an appeal    under section 429 of the Code only heard the case of    two others leaving the case of the condemned    accused who committed the murder.        ",
      "32. In State of UPV Dan Singh, (1997) 3    SCC 747 however two-member Bench of the Sup-    reme Court without considering the previous    decisions observed as follows:        “When the appeal as a whole is heard by    the Third Judge, he not only has an option of    delivering his opinion but, under the proviso to    section 392 of the Code of Criminal Procedure    he may require the appeal to be reheard and    decided by a large Bench of Judges. This was    an option which, under the provision, was also    open for any one of the two Judges, namely, BN    Katju and Rajeshwar Singh, JJ to exercise, but    they chose not to do so, What is clearly evident    is that the appeal is finally disposed of by the    judgment and order which follows the opinion    of the Third Judge. This being so special leave    petition could only have been filed after the    appeal was disposed of by the High Court vide    its final order dated 19-5-1988 . Even though the        said order purports to be related only to ten out    of thirty-two accused the said order has to be    read along with the earlier order of [5-4-1987    and, in law, the effect would be that the order            dated 19-5-1988 will be regarded as the final,    order whereby the appeal of the State was Party    allowed, with only two of the thirty-two,,    accused being convicted under section 325 reqq    with section 34, IPC, while all the other ACCUSEY        were acquitted.”        43, In Sajjan Singh (1999) SCC (Crip qq    also a Division Bench of the Supreme Court    ignoring the views taken in Babu’s Case, AIR 1965    SC 1467, and Hetubha Case, AIR 1970 SC 1266 dig    not approve the opinion taken by the Third Judge    and observed as follows:        “Statement of law is now quite explicit, I,    is the Third Judge whose opinion matters;    against the judgment that follows therefrom that    an appeal lies to this Court by way of special    leave petition under Article 136 of the Constj-    tution or under Article 134 of the Constitution    or under section 379 of the Code. The Third    Judge is, therefore, required to examine whole    of the case independently and it cannot be said    that he is bound by that part of the two opinions    of the two Judges comprising the Division    Bench where there is no difference. As a matter    of fact, the Third Judge is not bound by any    such opinion of the Division Bench. He is not    hearing the matter as if he is sitting in a three    Judge Bench where the opinion of majority    would prevail. We are thus of the opinion that    Prasad, J was not right in his approach and his    hands were not tied as far as the three appel-    lants, namely, Gajraj Singh, Meharban Singh    and Baboo Singh before him were concerned in    respect of whom both Judges of the Division    Bench opined that they were guilty and their    conviction and sentences were to be upheld.”        However in Sajjan Singh’s case despite the above    observations, the Court did not interfere with the    opinion of the Third Judge on the reasonings that    “Since we have heard the matter in respect of all the    three appellants at length we do not think it is    desirable now at this stage to remand the matter    when only some of the appellants could be said to    have been prejudiced because of the approach    adopted by Prasad, J”. The Supreme Court    thereupon heard the appeal on merit and dismissed    the appeal.                       ",
      "31. In Tanviben Pankaj Kumar Divetia vs    State of Gujarat (supra) it was observed:        “The plain reading of section 392 (our S        429) clearly indicates that it is for the Third        Judge to decide on what points he shall hear        arguments, if any, and it necessarily postulates        that the Third Judge is free to decide the appeal    by resolving the difference in the manner he    thinks proper.”        ",
      "30. In the case of Ananti P.    (supra) as it appears the Division Bench of the High    Court of Assam and Nagaland unanimously rejected    the first two contentions but were divided in their    Opinions on the points as to Whether the Magistrate    applied his mind to allow the investigating agency    lo investigate the cases and whether sanction under    section 196A wag necessary. The matter was then        laid before a Third Judge. The Third Judge held that    the Magistrate acted without        jurisdiction in allowing    agency to investigate into the    matter and accordingly he quashed the proceedings.    The question in dispute was whether a new point as    to the competency of the Magistrate at Delhi to    sanction investigation could have been raised before    the Third Judge since the said point had not been    raised before the Division Bench. AN Ray, J of the    Supreme Court approved the views taken in Het-    hubha Case (supra) wherein it was observed that    “the Third learned Judge could deal with the whole    case” and that there is no dispute in the statement of    law and it is in the discretion of the Third Judged to    deal with the case and in deciding the case if any    point is found necessary, he can decide the said    point as well. However in India, after amendment in    1973 section 429 was substituted by section 392    which reads as follows:      <br>  “392 . Procedure where Judges of Court of    appeal are equally divided—When an appeal    under this Chapter is heard by a High Court    before a Bench of Judges and they are divided    in opinion, the appeal, with their opinions, shall    be laid before another Judge of that Court, and    that Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit,    shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or    order shall follow that opinion;        Provided that if one of the Judges constitu-    ting the Bench, or where the appeal is laid    before another Judge under this section, that    Judge, so requires, the appeal shall be reheard    and decided by a larger Bench of Judges.”        It appears that the addition of a proviso as    above authorises one of the Judges constituting the    Division Bench or the Third Judge of a High Court                      of India, if so desires, can refer the appeal to a larger    Bench for rehearing and decision by such Bench of    Judges. The legislature has resolved the controversy    by addition of the proviso, in my view, in order to    remove the doubt about the conflicting views of the    Supreme Court of India, Under the present position,    fer the if the Division Bench requires, it may be    appeal for rehearing by a larger Bench of Judges if    there is difference of opinion on any point or points.    Similarly the Third Judge has been given the similar    discretionary power to refer the appeal to a larger    Bench if he does not agree with the opinion of the    Division Bench on any of the points involved in the    appeal decided by them.        ",
      "29. In the case of Hethubha (Supra) the    Supreme Court of India observed as follows:        “This Court in Babu vs State of Uttar    Pradesh, (1965) 2 SCR 771= (AIR 1965 SC    1467) held that it was for the Third learned    Judge to decide on what points the arguments    would be heard and therefore he was free to    resolve the differences as he thought fit. Mehta,    Jhere dealt with the whole case. Section 429 of    the Criminal Procedure Code states “that when    the Judges comprising the Court of Appeal are    equally divided in opinion, the case with their    opinion thereon, shall be laid before another    Judge of the same Court and such Judge, after    such hearing, if any, as he thinks fit, shall    deliver his opinion, and the Judgment and order    shall follow such opinion”. Two things are    noticeable; first, that the case shall be laid    before another Judge, and, secondly, the Judg-    ment and order will follow the opinion of the        Third learned Judge. It is, therefore, manifest    that the Third learned Judge     With the whole case,”        ",
      "27. In the case of Mohim Mandal vs State,    15 DLR 615 it was however observed that the    expression “difference of opinion” as used in the    sections 378 and 429 of the Code may be either as    regards the guilt or innocence of the accused or as to    the proper sentence to be passed. In either of these    cases the sections require the reference to be made    to another Judge. The Judge before whom the case    is laid for his opinion is entitled to pass any order he    thinks proper including an order directing retrial of    the accused. While confirming the sentence one    Judge may not accept a piece of evidence but accept!    the conviction and sentence in respect of an accused                          person but that does not mean that there is difference of opinion as regards conviction and sentence.    In the case of Babu vs State of (Supra),    on purport and power of the Third Judge came    sideration before a five-member Constitutional    up Bench of the Supreme Court of India. In that    rion pivision Bench differed in their opinions in    case and the conviction of three accused persons    and delivered two separate judgments. Before the    an ne Court the competency of the appeal was            “The section (S 429) contemplates that it is        for the Third Judge to decide on what points he    chall hear the arguments, if any, and that postu-    Jates that he is completely free in resolving the    difference as he thinks fit. In our judgment, it    was sufficient for Takru, J, to have said on the    question of the First Information Report that he    gid not consider it necessary to decide the point    put it was necessary, he was in agreement with    all that Mathur, J had said. There was, therefore,    a proper decision by Takru, J, and the certificate    could not be based upon the omission to discuss    the First Information Report and the doubts    about it.”        ",
      "26. In the case of Sarat Chandra Mitra vs     Emperor ILR 38 Cal 202, it was observed:    <br>    “I am not now concerned with the question,    of the trial of two petitioners with regard, to    one of who in the Judges composing the Court    of Appeal may be agreed in their opinion, While    as regards the others the Judges may be equally    divided in opinion. In such a contingency it is    quite possible to maintain the view that, upon p    reasonable interpretation of the term “case    what has to be laid before another Judge is the,    case of the prisoner as to whom the Judges are    equally divided in opinion. I am now concerned    only with the contingency in which the Judges    of the Court of Appeal are already divided in    opinion upon the question of the guilt of one    accused person, though upon certain aspects of    the case they may be agreed in their view, [n    such a contingency, what is laid before another    Judge, is, not the point or points upon which the    Judges are equally divided in opinion, but the    “case”. These obviously mean that, so far as the    particular accused is concerned, the whole case    is laid before the Third Judge, and it is his duty    to consider all the points involved, before he    delivers his opinion upon the case.”    <br>    As it appears in the case of Ahmed Sher vs Emperor    AIR 1931 (Lah) 513, Subeder Singh vs Emperor, AIR    1943 All 272, Nemai Mandal vs State of West    Bengal, AIR 1966 Cal 194 the above views have    been followed.        ",
      "25. On construction of sections 378 and 429    views taken by different High Courts are that what    is laid before another Judge is the “case” and    secondly, the judgment or order shall follow the    opinion given by such Judge and the opinion OF t    Third Judge will be regarded as the final juldgment.

It also appears that though section 378 is    included in chapter XXVII of the Code of Criminal    Procedure under the heading “OF THE SUBMIS-    SION OF SENTENCES FOR CONFIRMATION”    and section 429 is included in chapter XXXI under    the heading “OF APPEALS” but the language used    in both the sections is almost identical. The    expressions “as he thinks fit” used in both the    sections postulate that the Third Judge is completely    free in resolving the difference as he thinks fit and    accordingly if he decides that there is no need to    hear the arguments in respect of any accused of    whom the Judges are not divided in their opinion, he    may decline to do so, It also appears that the use of    the words “equally divided” in both the sections    means the Judges differ in their opinions, in respect    of complicity of an accused or on the charge framed    against him or on any particular point but in a case    where the Judges concur with each other in respect    of a particular accused and in respect of the offence    charged, it cannot be said that Judges are equally    divided in respect, of the accused charged with,        ",

The provisions of sections 374,    376, 377, 474 and 429 of the Code of Criminal    Procedure are reproduced below:    <br>    “374, Sentence of death to be submitted hy    Court--When the Court of Sessions passes    semence of death, the proceeding shall be    submitted to the (High Court Division] and the    sentence shall not be executed unless it is    confirmed by the [High Court Division].    <br>    376, Power of High Court Division to    confirm sentence or annul conviction, In any    case submitted under section 374, the High    Court Division— :    <br>    (a) may confirm the sentence, or pass any    other sentence warranted by law, or    <br>    (b) may annul conviction, and convict the    accused of any offence of which the Sessions    Court might have convicted him, or order a new    trial on the same or an amended charge, or    <br>    (c) may acquit the accused person:        Provided that no order of confirmation    shall be made under this section until the period    allowed for preferring an appeal has expired, or,    if an appeal is presented within such period,    until such appeal is disposed of.    <br>    “377 . In every case so submitted, the    confirmation of the sentence, or any new    sentence or order passed by the High Court    Division shall, when such Court consists of two    ér more Judges, be made, passed and signed by    at least two of them.”    <br>    “378 . When any such case is heard before    a bench of Judges and such Judges are equally    divided in opinion, the case, with their opinions    thereon, shall be laid before another Judge, and    such Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit    shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or    other shall follow such opinion.”    <br>    “429, When the Judges composing the    Court of Appeal are equally divided in opinion,    the case, with their opinions thereon shall be    laid before another Judge of the same Court,    and such Judge after such hearing (if any) as he                      thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the    judgment or order shall follow such opinion.        The above provisions show that Whenever a    sentence of death is passed by a Court of Sessions    the proceedings of the case shall be submitted to the    Hich Court Division for the confirmation of    sentence under section 374 of the Code, In dealing    with a proceeding under section 374 the High Court    Division itself acts on its appellate side power    irrespective of whether the accused sentenced to    death preferred an appeal or not and accordingly, the    Hich Court Division is bound to consider the    evidence and then arrive at an independent    conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the    accused. The power of the High Court Division to    confirm the sentence is provided in section 376 of    the Code. A duty is imposed upon the High Court    Division to satisfy itself that the conviction of the    accused is justified on the evidence and that the    sentence of death in the circumstances of the case is    and appropriate one.

Mr Ajmalul Hossain contends that there is    fundamental difference in sections 378 and 429 of    the Code of Criminal Procedure, inasmuch as while    in section 378 the expression “a bench of Judges”    has been used in section 429 the expression “the    Judges composing the Court of Appeal” has been    used and again in section 429 the expressions “of    the same Court” have not been used as used in the    other section. The learned Counsel further added    that a reference is required to be heard by at least    two Judges and the expression “bench of Judges”    used in section 378 means the sentence should have    to be confirmed and signed by at least two Judges    for the execution and a close reading of sections    374-378 would infer that the question of opinion of    the Third Judge arises when there is difference of    opinion of a bench of Judges and in a case where    there was no difference of opinion in respect of a    particular accused or accuseds the Third Judge was    left with no business to deal with his case and his    Opinion.

      "20. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Counsel    (chief prosecutor) appearing for State, submitted    that the Third leamed Judge is perfectly justified in    hearing the case of six convicts only in respect of    whom the learned Judges of the High Court    Division were equally divided in their opinion;    section 377 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure    merely relates to the procedure for confirmation in    respect of reference made under section 374 of the    Code; the words “as he thinks fit” and the words    “the judgment and order shall follow such opinion”    used in sections 378 and 429 of the Code are signi-    ficant and a close reading of the above expressions    show that a wide discretion has been given to the    Third Judge by the legislature to decide the case    either in respect of whom there is no difference of    opinion or in respect of whom there is difference of    opinion, and the judgment and order shall follow    such opinion; in the present appeals the Third    learned Judge, exercising his discretion, passed    order dated 6-2-2001 holding that “the case of above    9 condemned prisoners over whom the learned    Judges not being divided in opinion are not contem-    plated to be heard both under the provisions of    sections 378 and 429 of the Code of Criminal    Procedure, But only the case of accused Abdul    Mazed over whom there is difference as regard the    conviction under the two separate sections of the                       penal Code and the cases of those five other    condemned prisoners over which the learned Judges    re equally divided in OPINION ccc \", and    cordingly, the Third learned Judge duly disposed    y the reference and the appeals by confirming the    vqtenc€ of nine convicts including the appellants    which is in conformity with the requirements as    provided in sections 378 and 429 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure.

      "19. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the learned    Counsel representing Major Md Bazlul Huda and    Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer), adopted    the submissions made by Khan Saifur Rahman and    Abdur Razaque Khan.        ",
      "17. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned    Counsel for appellants Faruque Rahman and Mohi-    uddin (Artillery), further submitted that the learned    Chief Justice referred to the Third leaned Judge the    entire death reference not the piecemeal reference    for his disposal and so the Third learned Judge    should have heard the entire reference; the judgment    impugned is not a judgment in the eye of law as the    learned Judges expressed their opinion separately    and signed their opinion in violation of the provi-    sions of section 377 of the Code of Criminal    Procedure; since the learned Judges of the High    Court Division heard death reference as well as the    appeals both sections 378 and 429 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure are applicable and so opinion of    Third learned Judge shall be the conclusive opinion    and judgment and the order shall follow on that    basis which was not done in the present appeals; the    opinion of the Third Judge is also in no way a con-    current opinion in respect of the appellants Faruque    Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (Artillery)    specially when the first learned Judge disbelieved    their confessional statements while the second    learned Judge believed those.        18 Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, the learned    Counsel for the appellant Sultan Shahriar, further    submitted that in the present appeals there is no    confirmation of sentence in the eye of law since    there is no consensus confirmation of the sentence    by the High Court Division; the opinion of the        learned Judges of the High Court Division in jh,    present case cannot also be regarded as “judgmeny:    and as held in the case of Md Shafi vs Crown 6 Dip    (WP) 104 (FB) and the case of Abdur Razik vs Stay,    16 DLR (WP) 73 in case of difference of Pinion    while confirming the sentence, the opinion of the    Third Judge will prevail; the learned Judges of the    High Court Division also did not consider the    principles as laid down in the case of Hethubha yy    State of Gujrat AIR 1970 SC 1266, Union of India \\    Ananti Padmanabiah (1971) SCC (Crl) 533, Sajjan    Singh vs State of UP (1999 SCC 315 (Cri) 44 and    Mahim Mandal vs State 15 DLR 615 and committed    error in upholding the conviction and sentence.        ",
      "16. All the above mentioned petitions for    Jeave to appeal having raised the same question of    jaw and fact were disposed of by one leave granting    order granting leave as follows:      <br>  “(a) the leamed Judges of the Division Bench    of the High Court Division dealing with    the Death Reference and the connected cri-    minal appeals delivered two separate and    parallel judgments and signed their    individual judgment. These two separate    judgments signed separately cannot be    taken to be the judgment of the High Court    Division. This shows that the learned    Judges gave dissenting judgments and this    became palpable from the order dated 14-    12-2000 passed by the learned Judges    stating that the judgment given by them in    the Death Reference No.30 of 1998 was a    split one. Accordingly, the matter was    referred by the learned Judges to the    learned Chief Justice for necessary order.    Thereafter, the learned Chief Justice by    order dated 15-1-2001 appointed Mr    Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim as the    Third Judge to dispose of the Death    Reference as a whole meaning the case of    15 convicts. In this background of the    matter, it is strongly contended by the    learned Counsels that the Death Reference    case in its entirety was referred to the    Third Judge for disposal. Hence the    learned Third Judge having considered the    case of only 6(six) convicts committed an    error of law occasioning failure of justice.    <br>    (b) the occurrence took place in the early    morning on 15-8-1975, But the informant    PW | AFM Mohitul Islam was all along in    Dhaka after the occurrence and he joined    as a receptionist in the Bangabhaban on    3rd September, 1975 after the occurrence    and continued in service till he filed the    FIR on 2-10-1996 after a long lapse of        more than 21 years. This unreasonable    delay in lodging the FIR speaks of ill    intention and a design on the part of the    prosecution to falsely implicate the    convict petitioners in the occurrence on the    basis of concocted and manipulated evi-    dence to the prejudice of the convict peti-    tioners. The Courts below including the    High Court Division erred in failing to    consider this aspect while adjudging the    involvement of the convict petitioners in    the occurrence and also in convicting and    awarding capital sentence to them.    <br>    (c) although the evidence and materials on    record go to show that it was a case of    mutiny leading to the murder of the then    President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his    family members and not a case of murder    simpliciter but the convicts including the    convict petitioners were tried and con-    victed by a normal criminal Court as a case    of murder simpliciter. Hence the trial was    vitiated.    <br>    (d) the evidence and materials on record will    only show that there was no case of cri-    minal conspiracy for murder but a case of    criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny to    change the then Mujib Government.    Hence the conviction and sentence of the    convict petitioners are liable to be set    aside.    <br>    (e) charge of murder against the convict    petitioners under section 302 read with    section 34 of the Penal Code has not been    proved on the basis of proper evaluation    and sifting of evidence on record and thus    there has been a miscarriage of justice.”    <br>    As it appears at the trial, the prosecution tried to    establish its case against the appellants and other    accuseds on the basis of the evidence of the PWs,    confessional statement of appellants Faruque    Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (Artillery),    extra-judicial confession proved by PWs 15 and 8,    electronic evidence, and also circumstantial evi-    dence relating to conspiracy and, on the other hand,    the appellants and other accuseds tried to show that                          they were innocent, the confessional statements of    the above three appellants were not voluntary and    the President and his family members were killed as    a consequence of a successful revolt of the army    against the then Government. Regarding the ground    that the Third learned Judge should have heard the    entire reference, ig. the cases of all the fifteen    convicts instead of six convicts only, the common    submissions of the learned Counsels for the    appellants are that since the learned Judges of the    High Court Division delivered dissenting opinions,    the Third learned Judge ought to have heard the    entire death reference but he heard the reference    only in respect of six accuseds and so the present    reference as well as the appeals should be sent back    on remand to the Third learned Judge for hearing of    the death reference and the appeals afresh.        ",
      "15. Mohiuddin (Lancer) was tried and con-    victed in absentia due to his absconsion outside the    country and subsequently he was arrested from USA    and brought back in the country in July 2007 and    was sent to jail and he then filed Jail Petition No.9    of 2007 and subsequently filed an application for    condonation of delay stating that he had no know-    ledge of the case and the judgment of conviction and    sentence. This was opposed by the State by filing an                      affidavit. On hearing both the sides the delay being    condoned he filed Criminal Petition for Leave to    Appeal No.343 of 2007 which was heard analo-    gously with Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal    Nos. 95, 96, 97 and 98 of 2001.        ",
      "14. The Third learned Judge, after hearing,    on consideration of the facts and circumstances of    the case and materials available on record, took the    view that the prosecution has failed to prove the case    as against accuseds Major Ahmed Shariful Hossajp    alias Shariful Islam, Captain Md Kismat Hashem    and Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and having    found them as not guilty for the offence chargeg    acquitted them therefrom. The Third learned Judge,    however, found appellant Mohiuddin (Artillery),    accused Captain Abdul Mazed and Resalder Mos-    lemuddin alias Moslehuddin guilty for the offence    charged under sections 120B/302 and 34 of the    Penal Code and maintained their sentence of death    under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code agreeing    with ABM Khairul Haque J and accordingly,    accepted the Death Reference so far it related to    them and dismissed Criminal Appeal No.2617 of    1998 filed by the accused Lieutenant Colonel (Retd)    Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) and the conviction    and sentence of accuseds Captain Md Kismat    Hashem, Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain alias    Shariful Islam passed by the learned Sessions Judge,    Dhaka in Sessions Case No. 319 of 1997 was set    aside by the Third learned Judge holding them not    guilty agreeing with the view taken by Md Ruhul    Amin, J and accordingly, the Death Reference so far    as it related to Captain Md Kishmat Hashem,    Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and Major Ahmed    Shariful Hossain alias Shariful Islam was rejected.

      "13. The Third learned Judge then under the    provision of sections 378 and 429 of the Code ,    Criminal Procedure took up the hearing of the above    death reference and the appeals in respect of Only ¢,    accuseds including the appellant Mohiuddip    (Artillery) in respect of whom also the learneg    Judges of the Division Bench differed in their    opinion.        ",
      "12. Since the judgment in the Death Refer-    ence No, 30 of 1998 and the connected appeals was    a split one the above reference and concerned    appeals, as per provision of sections 378 and 429 of    the Code of Criminal Procedure, were placed before    the learned Chief Justice for necessary order and the    learned Chief Justice appointed Mohammad Fazlul    Karim, J as Third Judge to dispose of the Death    Reference and the connected appeals.            ",
      "11. Mr Khairul Hug J the other companion    Judge of the Bench however found all the 15    accuseds including the appellants guilty for the    offence charged and thereby affirmed the judgment    and sentence so passed by the trial Court and    accepted the Death Reference.        ",
      "10. | Then the Death Reference and all above    4 (four) Appeals were heard together by a bench of    the High Court Division consisting of two Judges,    out of whom Md Ruhul Amin J the presiding Judge    found the present appellants along with 4 others    guilty for the offence charged and maintained the    conviction and sentence under sections 302/34 and    120B of the Penal Code passed by the trial Court in    Sessions Case No.319 of 1997 and accepted the    Death Reference so far it related to four of the    present appellants and 4 others with a modification    of the mode of execution of sentence of death and    thereby accepted the Death Reference in part and    dismissed the conviction and sentence so far it    related to 5 accuseds including appellant Mohiuddin    (Artillery) under sections 302/34 and 120B of the    Penal Code and accordingly, the Death Reference so    far it relates to them was not accepted.        ",
      "9. Being aggrieved by the impugned order    of conviction and sentence, appellant Faruque                      Rahman preferred Criminal Appeal No. 2616 of    1998, appellant Sultan Shahriar preferred Criminal    Appeal No. 2604 of 1998 and the appellant Mohi-    uddin (Artillery) preferred Criminal Appeal No.    1617 of 1998 . Appellant Bazlul Huda, who    althrough remained absconding during the whole    period of trial, was brought back from Bangkok to    Dhaka on the date of the pronouncement of judg-    ment of the trial Court i.c, 8-11-1998, in pursuance    of an extradition proceedings against him in    Bangkok and he then filed a regular appeal against    his conviction and sentence being Criminal Appeal    No. 2613 of 1998 before the High Court Division.

      "8. The trial Court, thereafter, in conside-    ration of the evidence on record as well as facts and    circumstances of the case by judgment and order    dated 8-11-1998, acquitted four of the accused per-    sons, namely, |. Taheruddin Thakur, 2 . Hon. Captain    A Wahab Joarder, 3 . Dafader Marfat Ali Shah    (absconding), 4 . Ld Md Abul Hashem Mridha    (absconding), and convicted the rest 15 (fifteen)    accused persons under sections 302/34 of the Penal    Code and also under section 120B of the Penal Code    and all 15 convicts including the appellants were    sentenced to death under sections 302/34 of the    Penal Code and no separate sentence under section    120B of the Penal Code was imposed upon them.    The aforesaid 15 accuseds including the appellants    were not found guilty under section 201 of the Penal    Code and were acquitted on that charge.        ",
      "7. Prosecution examined 61 witnesses out    of whom some were tendered by the prosecution    and not cross-examined by the defence. The defence    did not adduce any evidence. After close of the    prosecution witnesses the three appellants on dock    were examined under section 342 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure to which they repeated their    innocence. The defence case as could be gathered    from the trend of cross-examination is total denial    and that the appellants are innocent and the    occurrence did not take place in the manner as    alleged, inasmuch as the occurrence is the result of    successful mutiny by some Army personnel.        ",
      "6. Appellants Farook Rahman, Sultan Shah-    riar and Mohiuddin (Artillery), who were present in    the trial Court pleaded not guilty to the charges and    prayed to be tried. They were defended by the    learned Advocates of their own choice while the rest    14 absconding accused persons were defended by    the learned Advocates appointed by the State.        ",
      "5. The learned trial Court Judge also        framed another charge under section 201 of the        Penal Code for wilfully causing disappearance of    the evidence.        ",
      "4. The learned Sessions Judge by his Order    No. 15 dated 7-4-1997 framed the following charges    against the accused persons.                      First charge: The accused persons in collusion    with Late Khondker Mushtaque Ahmed, Late Mah-    bubul Huq Chashi, Resalder Syed Sarowar Hossain    and Captain M Mostafa Hossain, in order to satisfy    ant personal grievance to fulfil joint interest, to    ea personal aggrandisement and ambition with    ae motive, they met and conspired/together on    Paeet dates since March, 1975, at different    is ces, namely, at the residence of Lieutenant Colo-    “| Khondker Abdur Rashid at his residence at the    phaka Cantonment, BARD at Comilla, Shalna at    Gazipur the village residence of Khondker Moshtaq    ahmed at Daspara within PS and Daudkandi and at    pis residence at 54, Aga Mosi Lane, at Ramna Park,    at the residence of Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shah-    riat Rashid Khan at the Cantonment and in other    places in order to murder Bangabandhu Sheikh    Mujibur Rahman, the then President of Bangladesh,    hig relations and his family members. In order to    achieve their such objective, they assembled at    palur ghat within Cantonment Police Station on the    night following 14th August, 1975 and in fulfilment    of such conspiracy, the accused persons killed 1]    ersons on the morning of 15th August including the    then President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his    family members. As such, they committed an    offence under section 120B of the Penal Code.        Second Charge: In pursuance of the said    premeditore conspiracy and in furtherance of their    common intention, (to carry out the object of the    said criminal conspiracy) the accused persons men-    tioned in the first charge in collusion with late    Khondker Mushtaque Ahmed, late Mahbubul Alam    Chashi, Resalder Syed Sarwar Hossain and Captain    M Moshtaq Ahmed in order to vindicate their own    personal vendetta and joint interest and ambitions in    fulfilment of their conspiratorial scheme, armed    with deadly weapons, such as, tanks, cannons,    machineguns, stunguns, rifles attacked (the resi-    dence of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the    then President of Bangladesh at 677, Dhanmondi    Residential Area, Road No. 32 and murdered Ban-    gabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his wife Begum    Fazilat-un-nessa, sons Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal,    Sheikh Russell. daughters-in-law, Sultana Kamal,    Rozy Jamal and brother Sheikh Naser. Besides, they    also killed Siddiqur Rahman, ASI Police. Shamsul    Haque. Sepoy of the army and Colonel Jamil,        Military Secretary to the President and thereby com-    mitted an offence punishable under sections 302/34    of the Penal Code.        ",
      "3. Among the 19 accused persons who    faced trial, 14 were absconding. The learned Judges    of the High Court Division found that the warrants    of their arrests were duly issued and when they    could not be apprehended by the police in spite of    their efforts, their properties both movable and    immovable were attached in accordance with the    provisions of the Code and thus the requirements of    sections 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Proce-    dure were satisfied and since the said accuseds    remained fugitives from law, necessary notices were    duly published in the newspaper, as required under    section 339B of the Code. Records also show that all    possible and practicable steps were taken to bring    the fugitives before the Court.        ",
      "2.

      "  Section 10        Common Intention—When a criminal cons-    piracy for committing murder has been estab-    lished there is no need to award a conviction in    the aid of section 34 for, in an offence of criminal                      conspiracy anything said, done or written in    reference to their common intention after the    intention was entertained is relevant against all    the accused, When specific acts done by each of    the accused have been established showing their    common intention they are admissible against    each and every other accused. Though an act or    action of one accused cannot be used as evidence    against other accused but an exception has been    carved out in section 10 of the Evidence Act in    case of criminal conspiracy, If there is reasonable    ground to believe that two or more persons have    conspired together in the light of the language    used in 120A of the Penal Code, the evidence of    acts done by one of the accused can be used        against the other.        In pursuance of the criminal conspiracy if the cons-    pirators commit several offences, then all of them will be    liable for the offences even if some of them had not    actively participated in the commission of the offences. It    is Not required to prove that each and every person who is    2 party to the conspiracy must do some overt-act towards    the fulfilment of the object of conspiracy, the essential    ingredient being an agreement between the conspirators to    commit the crime since from its very nature a conspiracy    is hatched in secrecy, direct evidence of a criminal conspi-    racy 10 commit a crime is not available otherwise the    whole purpose may frustrate—in most cases only the cir-    cumstantial evidence which is available from which an    inference giving rise to the commission of an offence of    conspiracy may be legitimately drawn.

      "      Section 376        Commutation of death sentence—There is no    merit in the contention that uncontrolled and    unguided discretion of the Judges to impose capi-    tal punishment or imprisonment for life is hit by    Article 14 of the Constitution. If the Law has    given to the Judge a wide discretion in the matter    of sentence to be exercised by him after balancing    all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances    of the crime it will be impossible to say that there              would be at all any discrimination since facts and    circumstances of one case can hardly be the same    as the facts and circumstances of another.        What are the mitigating circumstances in the exercise    of court ‘s discretion have been explained thus: (a) that the    offence was committed under the influence of extreme        mental or emotional disturbance; (b) the age of the    accused .if the accused is young or old, he shall not be    sentenced to death; (c) the probability that the accused    would not commit criminal acts of violence as would    constitute Or continuing threat to society; (d) in the facts    and circumstances of the case the accused believed that he    was morally justified in committing the offence; (e)the    accused acted under duress or domination of another    rson , and (f) the condition of the accused showed that        he was mentally defective and that the said defect    impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his    conduct. In Jagmohan the following circumstances are    considered in mitigation of punishment which should be    inflicted such as (i) absence of bad intention; (ii)    provocation, (iii) self-preservation; (iv) preservation of    some near friends; (v) transgression of the limit of self-    defence; (vi) submission to the menaces; (vii) submission    to authority; (viii) drunkenness; (ix) childhood.

      "        Section 376    According to our provision the Court has    been left with the discretion on the facts of the    given case whether or not a sentence of death    should be awarded, and in case of awarding a    sentence of death the Court is required to assign    reason. The Court is of course keeping in mind    while awarding the extreme sentence whether    there is mitigating circumstances to exercise such    discretion. The mitigating circumstances in the    exercise of Courts discretion as analysed in    Jogmohan’s case (AIR 1971 SC 500) are    undoubtedly relevant circumstance and might be        given weight in the determination of sentence.

Without jointly operating    in concert the criminal object could not have    been executed. It was not possible to bring about    the result of the criminal object without support    of all.

      "      Sections 378 & 429    Hearing of the case by a Third Judge—        The language used in sections 378 and 429 of the    Code is almost identical. It is said that in hearing    a reference or an appeal if the Judges are equally    divided in opinion thereon, the case with their    opinions shall be laid before a third Judge for    hearing, and the third Judge after hearing ‘as he    thinks fit? would deliver his opinion, and the    judgment and order would follow such opinion.    The expressions “as he thinks fit” used in both    the sections are significant. It is the third Judge    to decide on what points or in respect of whom he              shall hear arguments, This postulates that the    third Judge is completely free in resolving the    difference as he thinks fit. If he does not think to    near the arguments in respect of any accused of    whom the Judges are not divided in their    opinions, he may decline to do so. The use of the    words “equally divided” in both the sections    means the Judges differ in their opinions, in    respect of complicity of an accused or on the    charge framed against him or them or on any    particular point it can be inferred that they are    equally divided but in a case where the Judges    concur each other in respect of a particular    accused and in respect of the offence charged, it    can not be said that Judges are equally divided in    respect of the accused charged with.        One view is that the Third Judge is required to    examine the whole case independently and that he is not    bound by the two opinions of the two Judges comprising    the Division Bench even if there is no difference in respect    of any one of the accused persons. The other view is that    it is the discretion of the Third Judge to decide on what    points he shall hear the arguments, if any, and he is    completely free in resolving the difference.

In order to bring an offence of mutiny    within the ambit of the Act, there must be        MaJor BazLut Hupa vs STATE 3        evidence of overthrowing or resisting lawful    authority of the armed forces or disobeying the    authority in such circumstances as to make the    disobedience subversive of discipline or to    impede the performance of any duty or service in    the armed forces of Bangladesh. There is nothing    on record to show that the appellants and other    accused have collectively insubordinated or    defied or disregarded the authority in the armed    forces or refused to obey authority in order to    bring their act within the ambit of mutiny or    abetment for mutiny.

      "    Section 8(2)        Plea of ‘mutiny’—Since the prosecution wit-    nesses did not say anything in support of the plea    of mutiny, the defence ought to have made out a    case at least by way of suggestion to the witnesses    that the army officers involved in the mutiny    submitted their charter of demands to the    authority in the armed forces and that as their        .demands were not redressed, they revolted.        Secondly, if there was rebellion as claimed the        rebellious force would have attacked their com-        manding officer, and if the commanding officer    was involved, they would have attacked the Chief    of army staff but they did not attack them, rather    killed the President which proved that it was not    a mutiny.

This section is intended to meet a case    where members of a party acted in furtherance    of the common intention of all but it was diffi-    cult to prove exactly the part played by each of    them, It means that if two or more persons    intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the    same as if each of them had done it individual-    ly, Common intention within the meaning of    this section presupposes a prior concert. There    must be prior meeting of minds to form pre    arranged plan to commit an offence. A common    intention with meeting of minds to commit a\"    offence in furtherance of the common intention    invites the application of section 34 of the Penal    Code. In offences involving physical violenc*    normally presence at the scene of the offence °    the offender sought to be rendered liable on tH    Principle of joint liability is necessary but such  is not the case in respect of other offences  where offence consists of diverse acts which  may be done at different time and place,”    ",

In this context it would be pertinent    to consider the case of Tukaram Ganpat Pandare vs    State of Maharashtra reported in AIR 1974 SC 5] 4,    where some articles were stolen from the godown        and carried away by a lorry which stopped at a    weigh bridge. There was no evidence about the pres-    ence of the appellants at the scene of offence but he    was found in possession of a duplicate key of the        burgled godown and he was    Hs present at the Weigt    Uridge. R Krishna Lyer, J held— -    <br>    “Mere distance from the scene of cr;    bed        cannot exclude culpability under sectio, :    which lays down the rule of joint Tesponsibjt:,    for a criminal act performed by a plurality 2    persons, In Barandra Kumar Ghosh ys Kin    Emperor, (1924) 52 IA 40 = AIR 1925 Pc | ‘    Judicial Committee drew into the crimina| fe    those ‘who only stand and wait.’ This doe; not    mean that some form of presence, near ,,    remote, is not necessary, or that mere Presence    without more, at the spot of crime, spells culpa    bility.

Together operating in concert, the    criminal project is executed. Those who supply    the duplicate key, wait at the weigh bridge for    the bread-in and bringing of the booty and later    secrete the keys are participes criminis.”    [emphasis added]        ",
      "380. Inthe case of Rasod Bux vs State report-    ed in 22 DLR (SC) 297, one of the accuseds fired his    gun towards the victim but the appellant fired two    shots in the air. It was contended that the. appellant    had no intention to commit any murder. The judg-    ment and order of conviction and sentence was    affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. While    passing judgment Hamoodur Rahman, J observed in    the following manner:    “There is‘no doubt that to bring a case    within the ambit of section 34, PPC, it is neces-    sary that some overt act .or acts must be established                      to Jead to the inference that the participa-    tors in the crime acted in pre-concert oF under    some pre-arranged plan but this does not ee    that every participant in the crime must be    shown to have committed the same kind of act.    It is sufficient to show that they joined together    in the commission of a particular act, for then    they must all be deemed to have intended the    natural and inevitable consequences of that act    even if some of them did nothing but merely    helped by their presence the commission of the    act.”    <br>    In the case of Tunu vs State of Orissa reported    in 1988 CriLJ 524, BK Behera, J held—    <br>    “Common intention is to be gathered from        the acts and conduct of the accused persons pre-    ceding, attending and succeeding the occur-    rence. No doubt, the petitioner, who had stood    on the road and blocked it had not participated    in the actual assault, but his conduct in blocking    the road and forcing PW 14 to stop the car and    thereby facilitating the other two persons to    attack PW 14 would undoubtedly show that he    had shared the common intention with the other    two petitioners to attack and assault PW 14 . It is    not necessary that to attract section 34 of the    Code, every person must have assaulted and    caused hurt.” i        ",
      "379. Section 34 of the Penal Code being a rule    of evidence and not a substantive offence, it is com-    mitted when two or more persons intentionally    commit a criminal act jointly in furtherance of a    common intention of all. Common intention pre-    supposes a prior concert or pre-arranged plan    between the persons participating to commit an    offence. Common intention under section 34 can be    established as an inference from the fact of partici-    pation in the commission of the offence.        ",
      "378. Matters relating to section 34 of the    Penal Code, 1860= Acts done by several persons in    furtherance of common intention.        It has been asserted by Mr Khan Saifur Rahman    and Mr Abdur Razaque Khan that accused    Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman (Lancer),    Licutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan    and Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Artillery) having not been present at the time of    killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman    and his family members, they cannot be convicted    under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code    because they were not physically present at the    place of occurrence. In this context, it appears that    the accused appellants were separately deployed in    different places, according to their pre-plans and    pre-design in furtherance of the common intention    of all the accused persons, those who were physical-    ly present and those who were not present at House    No. 677, Road No.32, Dhanmondi but the deploy-    ment was done as per their pre-plan‘at various places    in furtherance of their common intention and, as    such, they are also equally guilty of the offences    under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code.        ",
      "377. In view of the aforesaid decisions we are        of the view that even if the acts of the accused have    gone beyond the stage of conspiracy and the sub-    stantive offence is committed in pursuance thereof,    both the specific charges of substantive offence    along with the charge of conspiracy can be simulta-    neously maintained, inasmuch as either conspiracy    or a substantive offence or both may be proven on    the same fact. Just because a conspiracy is culmi-    nated into a substantive criminal offence does not    render the act of conspiracy a separate and distinct    offence, vitiated or nullified. The act of conspiracy,    having once been committed, crystallises into an    offence under section 120B of the Penal Code,    Which continues to be a criminal offence, notwith-    Standing the subsequent events, if any. Offence    under section 120B, Penal Code is generally co-    extensive with any substantive offence committed    Subsequently. Accordingly, in the instant case,    charge under section 302 and section 120B of the    Penal Code was rightly maintained against the    accused appellants in all the appeals.            ",
      "376. Having considered the decision in the    case of Leo Roy Frey vs Superintendent, District    Jail Amiritsar reported in AJR 1958 SC 119, SR    Das.C.J. explained the offence of conspiracy vis-a-    yjs the substantive offence in the following terms:        “The offence of a conspiracy to commit a    crime is a different offence from the crime that    is the object of the conspiracy because the con-    spiracy precedes the commission of the crime    and is complete before the crime is attempted or    completed, equally the crime attempted or com-    pleted does not require the element of conspira-        cy as one of its ingredients. They are, therefore,    quite separate offences.”        ",
      "375. ‘In the case of State vs Nalini (1999) ;        SCC 253, Quadri, J held that it is not necessary \"    all the conspirators should participate from t                      inception to the end of the conspiracy; some may    ! : the conspiracy after the time when such inten-    os was first entertained by any one of them and        ye others may quit from the conspiracy. All of    0\" m cannot but be treated as conspirators. Where in    guance of the agreement the conspirators commit        ences individually or adopt illegal means to do a    iecall act which has a nexus to the object of conspir-    cyvall of them will be liable for such offences even    a come of them have not actively participated in the    vomnmission of those offences. . femphasis added]        ",

In the case of Suresh Chandra Bahri vs Sate of Bihar reported in AIR 1994 SC 2420, while confronted with contention that there is no direct illegal evidence against the appellants for their involvement in conspiracy.     “Where the conspiracy alleged is with    regard to commission of a serious crime of the    nature as contemplated in section 120B reaq        with the proviso to sub-section (2) of section        120A of the IPC then in that event mere proof    of an agreement between the accused for com-    mission of such a crime alone is enough to    bring about a conviction under section 120B        _ and the proof of any overt act by the accused or    by-any one of them would not be necessary. The    provisions in such a situation do not require that    each and every person who is a party to the con-        spiracy must do some overt act towards the ful-    filment of the object of conspiracy, the essential    ingredient being an agreement between the con-    spirators to commit the crime and if these    requirements and ingredients are established    the act would fall within the trapping of the pro-    visions as contained in section 120B since from    its very nature a conspiracy must be conceived    and hatched in complete secrecy, because other-    wise the whole purpose may be frustrated and it    is common experience and goes without saying    that only in very rare cases one may come    across direct evidence of a criminal conspiracy    '0 commit any crime and in most-of the cases !    is only circumstantial evidence which is avail    able from which an inference giving rise to the    conclusion of an agreement between two °    more persons to commit an offence may    legitimately drawn,” [emphasis added,        ",
      "373. In the case of Kehar Singh vs State        (Delhi Admn) reported in AJR 1980 SC 1983,    K Jagannatha Shetty, J observed as follows:    <br>    “Generally, a conspiracy is hatched in    Secrecy and it may be difficult to adduce direct    evidence of the same. The prosecution will    often rely on evidence of acts of various parties    to infer that they were done in reference to their    common intention. The prosecution will also    more often rely upon circumstantial evidence.    The conspiracy can be undoubtedly proved by    such evidence direct or circumstantial. But the    Court must enquire whether the two persons are    independently pursuing the same end or they    have come together to the pursuit of the unlaw-    ful object. The former does not render them    conspirators, but the latter does. It is, however    essential that the offence of conspiracy required    some kind of physical manifestation of agreement.        ",
      "372. In the case of Sanjaya Gandhi vs State    (Delhi Admn) reported in AIR 1980 SC 1382 the    Supreme Court of India observed—        pre it is well settled that in order to    prove a criminal conspiracy which is punish-    able wander section 120B of the Indian Penal    Code, there must be direct or circumstantial    evidence to show that there was an agreement    between two or more persons to commit an    offence. This clearly envisages that there must    be 2 meeting of minds resulting in an ultimate    decision taken by the conspirators regarding the    commission of an offence. It-is true that in most    cases it will be difficult to get direct evidence of    an agreement 10 conspire but a conspiracy can    be inferred even from circumstances giving rise    to 2 conclusive or irresistible inference of an    agreement belween two or more persons to    commu! an offence.”        ",
      "374. In the case of Suresh Chandra Bahyj 7\"    State of Bihar reported in AIR 1994 SC 2429, While    confronted with the contention that there is no direc    illegal evidence against the appellants for their    involvement in conspiracy, the Supreme Cour of    India observed:        ",
      "371. Sardar Sardul Singh Caveeshar vs State    of Maharashtra reported in AIR 1965 SC 682 the    Supreme Court of India held:        <br>        “The essence of conspiracy is, therefore,    that there should be an agreement between per-    sons to do one or other of the acts described in    the section, The said agreement may be proved    by direct evidence or may be inferred from acts    and conduct of the parties.”        ",
      "370. In the earlier case of Barindra Kumar    Ghose vs Emperor reported in CWN 1/14, Jenkins, J        observed as follows:    <br>    “A conspiracy consists not merely in the    intention of two or more, but in the agreement    of two or more to do an unlawful act, or to do a    lawful act by unlawful means. Though to:estab-    lish a charge of conspiracy there must be agree-    ment, there need not be proof of direct meeting    or combination, nor need the parties be brought    into each other’s presence, The agreement may    be inferred from ciroumstances raising a. pre-    sumption of a common concerted plan to carry    out the unlawful design. Nor is it necessary that    all should have joined in the scheme from the    first; those who come in at a later stage are        equally guilty, provided the agreement be    proved.” [emphasis added]                      some kind of physical manifestation of are    ment. The express agreement, however, need    not be proved, Nor actual meeting of two Ne    sons is necessary. Nor it is necessary to Prov,    the actual words of communication. The evi    dence as to transmission of thought sharing the        unlawful design may be sufficient.”        ",
      "369. The offence of conspiracy like any other    offence can be proved by direct evidence or by cir-    cumstantial evidence but in practice it is extremely    difficult to get direct evidence in proof of conspira-    cy. In the decision of the case of Nur Mohammad    Mohd. Yusuf Momin vs State of Maharashtra report-    ed in AJR 1971 SC 885 LD Dua, J held:      <br>  “A conspiracy from its very nature is gen-    erally hatched in secret. It is, therefore,    extremely rare that direct evidence in proof of    conspiracy can be forthcoming from wholly    disinterested quarters or from utter strangers.    But, like other offences, criminal conspiracy    can be proved by circumstantial evidence.    Indeed in most cases proof of conspiracy is    largely inferential though the inference must be    founded on solid facts. Surrounding circum-    stances and antecedent and subsequent conduct,    among other factors, constitute relevant materi-    al. In fact, because of the difficulties in having    direct evidence of criminal conspiracy, once    reasonable ground is shown for believing that    two or more persons have conspired to commit    an offence then anything done by any one of    them in reference to their common: intention    after the same is:entertained becomes, accord-    ing to the law of evidence, relevant for proving    both conspiracy and the offences. committed    pursuant thereto.”        ",
      "368. The offence of criminal conspiracy is    committed where there is an agreement by the two    Or more persons to do an illegal act or an act by ille-        gal means in furtherance of their common design.    AD 13        ",
      "367. It appears that learmed Judges of the    pivision Bench having examined the judgment and    ondet passed by the leamed Sessions Judge and also    evidence of 16 prosecution witnesses, namely, PW    43, PW 11 . PW 12 . PW 14, PW 21, PW 22, PW 24,    pw25, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW 39, PW    40, PW 41 and PW 44 found that the prosecution    successfully proved the charge of conspiracy under    section 120B of the Penal Code. Moreover, the sec-    ond leamed Judge having found the confessional    statements made by the accused appellants, namely,    Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,    Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan    znd Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Anillery) true and voluntary admitted the same as    legal piece of evidence and rightly convicted the    accused appellants under section 120B of the Penal    Code and, as such, no interference is called for by    this Hon’ble Court.        Section 120A and 120B of the Penal Code,    1860-Conspiracy:        “120A. When two or more persons agree to    do, or cause to be done,—      <br>  (1) an illegal act, or  <br>      (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal    means, such an agreement is designated a crim-    inal conspiracy: Provided that no agreement    except an agreement to commit an offence shall    amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some    act besides the agreement is done by one or    more parties to such agreement in pursuance    thereof.”        ",
      "366. According to the briefings of Lieutenant    Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman troops under the    command of the officers were deployed at the house    of Sheikh Fazlul Haq Moni, Abdur Rob Shemiabal,    Hon’ble Minister of Bangladesh, the radio station.    the Cantonment, distance to the Headquarters ol    Rakkhi Bahini and some were also deployed '    resist BDR; Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) was se\"    to terrorise the house guards in the residence of the    then President and also to resist the Rakkhi Bahin''!    so required, and Major Bazlul Huda, Major AKM    Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Aziz Pasha went over     the residence of the President and Resalder Mosle    Uddin went to the house of the then Preside\"    Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

",
      "365. The second learned Judge having consid,    ered the submissions advanced on behalf of the    accused appellants and respondent rightly found that    PW 25, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW 39, py,    40 and PW 41 had corroborated each other in Prov.    ing conspiracy and participation by the accused per.    sons. All the witnesses also stated in their evideng,    that the accused appellants, namely, Lieutenan    Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colone,    Abdur Rashid and Lieutenant Colonel Sharify    Haque Dalim having addressed the troops of the    Amny indoctrinated them to engage in conspiracy    and launch the operation in furtherance of their    common intention to achieve the ultimate goal in the    early morning of 15th August, 1975 . The accused    persons went to different places as per deployment    by Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and    his associates and assembled in those places in order    to commit the illegal act by illegal means and all of    them committed the offence under section 120B of    the Penal Code. It also appears from the evidence of    witnesses that First Bengal Lancer Regiment and        - Two Field Artillery Regiment were indoctrinated        and instigated to do a “special urgent duty in the    interest of the country”.        ",
      "364. From a careful scrutiny of the evidence    of the prosecution witnesses and also from the con-    fessional statement made by aforementioned three    accused appellants it appears that the conspiracy    started in the month of March,1975 at BARD,    Comilla, then in the month of June/July, 1975 in the    house of Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed at Doudkandi,    Comilla which was also attended by Lieutenant    Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Khondaker Abdur    Rashid, Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed,    Taheruddin Thakur and others. Thereafter the con-    spiracy continued in the house of Khondker    Moshtag Ahmed in Agha Masi Lane, Ramna Park,    and subsequently in Balurghat parade ground on the    following night of 14th August, 1975, PW 11, PW    12 and PW 14 in their evidence gave detailed    descriptions about the night parade held on the night    following on 14th August, 1975 . At the end of the    night parade, there was conference and briefings by    the accused Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque    Rahman and others. After midnight all the accused    persons and others who were assembling in the    parade ground of the Lancer Regiment and after giv-    ing final task to their conspiracy First Bengal Lancer    Unit with tanks and troops from 2nd Field Artillery    Regiment with cannons and light arms were    deployed in different places in the city ending at        Road No.32, Dhanmondi, Dhaka to commit the    offence. The second learned Judge of the Division    Bench has also considered the evidence of PW 21        PW 22, PW 24, PW 26, PW 32, PW 34, PW 35, PW    39, PW 40, PW 42 and PW 44 proving conspiracy    against the accused persons. The evidence of PW 21    manifests the preparation in 2nd Field Artillery    Regiment, the evidence of PW 22 shows the Prep,    ration for onslaught and the evidence of pw ,,    shows a retired Resalder of Ist Bengal Lance    Regiment directly participated in the conspiracy, t        ",
      "363. Inthe case of Mohd. Usman Mohammad    Hossain Maniyar vs State of Moharashtra reported    in AJR 1981 SC 1062, at page 1067 para 16 Baharul    Islam, J observed:    <br>    “It is true that there is no evidence of any    express agreement between the appellants to do                      or cause to be done the illegal act. For an    offence under section 120B the prosecution    need not necessarily prove that the perpetrators    expressly agreed to do or cause to be done the    illegal act; the agreement may be proved by    necessary implication. In this case, the fact that    the appellants were possessing and selling    explosive substances without a valid licence for    a pretty long time leads to the inference that    they agreed to do and/or caused to be done the    said illegal act, for, without such an agreement    the act could not have been done for such a long    time.”        ",
      "362. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, the learned    Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant    Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan,    has placed the relevant portion of the evidence and    submitted that the learned Judges of the Division    Bench erred in law in failing to find out that the    learned Sessions Judge relying on extraneous facts    and circumstances found the accused appellant    guilty under section 120B of the Penal Code without    any specific finding in respect of the said offence,    rather the trial Court relied on inadmissible evi-    dence. He has submitted that there was no legal evi-    dence against the appellant showing his complicity    in the offence of conspiracy. It appears that PW 43    had seen accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan attending in a meeting    at the house of Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed in the    month of June/July, 1975 . After the meeting at the    premises of a Madrasa at Daudkandi the accused    Shahriar, Faruque, Khondker Abdur Rashid also    attended a secret meeting with Khondker Moshtaq    Ahmed, Taheruddin Thakur and others. It is well    established that conspiracy is always hatched in    secrecy. In most cases it is impossible to adduce    direct evidence in proof of conspiracy. In the case of    Shivnarayan Laxminarayan Joshi vs State of    Moharastra reported in AIR 1980 SC 439, Fajal Ali,    J observed that a conspiracy is always hatched in    secrecy and it is impossible to adduce direct evi-    dence of the same. The offence can be only proved    largely from the inferences drawn from acts or ille-    gal omission committed by the conspirators in pur-    suance of a common design.        ",
      "361. In reply to the submission of Mr Khan    Saifur Rahman, the learned Advocate for the    accused appellant, the leamed Attorney-General has    submitted that the confessional statement made by    the accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed    Feruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Sultan    Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant Colonel    Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) are true and voluntary    and, as such, those statements should be taken into    consideration. The learned Attorney-General has    further submitted that on the evidence of witnesses,    namely PW 51 and PW 61 and also from the case    record it appears that the findings of the first learned    Judge in respect of section 10 was totally based on    misreading of evidence on record, All of them made    confessions voluntarily. The non-filing up of some    of the columns of the forms of confession by the    recording Magistrate is not fatal. In support of this    Contention he has referred to the case of State vs    Nolini reported in (1999) 5 SCC 353 and the case of    State vs Lalu Miah reported in 39 DLR (AD) ! 17 . In  reply to the submissions of learned Advocate for the    appellants to the effect that when a conspiracy has    Bone beyond the stage of conspiracy and offence Is    Committed in pursuance thereof, then conspiracy        becomes irrelevant i.e. no conviction can be award-        MAaJor BAZLUL Hupa vs STATE (MM Hossain J 95        ed for conspiracy if substantive offence is commit-    ted in pursuance thereof. To substantiate his argu-    ment, he has also referred to the decision in the case    of the State of Andhra Pradesh vs Kandimalla    Subbaiah reported in AJR 1961 SC 1241, State of    Kerala vs Sugathan reported in AJR 2000 SC 3323,    Kehar Singh vs State (Delhi Admn) reported in A/R    1988 SC 1883.        ",
      "360. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, Mr Abdur    Razaque Khan and Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the    learned Advocates for the appellants have submitted    in unison that the evidence and materials on record    will only show that there was no case of criminal    urder but the case of criminal con-    spiracy to commit mutiny to change the then Mujib    Government. Hence, the conviction and sentence of        accused appellants is liable to be set aside. They    have submitted that the allegation of mutiny carries    y within the defini-        with it the existence of conspirac    tion of the offence of mutiny. Having drawn our    attention to the evidence of witnesses, Mr Khan    Saifur Rahman has submitted that there was a con-    spiracy for mutiny and.not to commit murder of    President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with members of    his family. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman has also    referred to the opinion of the Third learned Judge    and submits that the Third learned Judge comment-    ed on the event of 15th August as revolting one and    the said findings of the Third learned Judge is a find-    ing of the situation as a mutiny obtaining in course    of the occurrence. He has submitted that there is no    direct evidence to the effect that the murder was    intended to be committed by the appellants. He has    also submitted that the places of deployment of    occurrence in the house of Abdur Rab Sherniabat    and Sheikh Fazlul Hug Moni are not included in the    charge and in the fact of the case and in the instant    case there is no account of conspiracy by any of the    co-accused of the case and thereby those places    added to the case events in the course of same trans-    action extending the facts of the case beyond its    place of occurrence are illegal merging of unrelated    evidence with the case and embellishing the case    with unrelated evidence and, as such, the conviction    and sentence of the accused appellants for commit-    ting murder and also for committing criminal con-    spiracy for murder are not tenable in law, Referring    to the decision in the case of Md Shamsul Haque vs    State reported in 20 DLR 540, he has submitted that    when a conspiracy has gone beyond the stage of    conspiracy and offence is committed in pursuance    thereof, then conspiracy becomes irrelevant i.e. no    conviction can be awarded for conspiracy if sub-    stantive offence is committed in pursuance thereof.    Mr Anisul Hug, the learned Advocate for the respon-    dent State, and Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned    Attorney-General, have submitted in unison that in conspiracy of m    the instant case the accused appellants have f,,    rightly convicted under section 120B of the Penal    Code as the charge against them for the gay,    offence of criminal conspiracy was proved beyong    reasonable doubt. Mr Mahbubey Alam has Submit.    ted that in the charge framed against the ACCUsey    appellants, nothing was mentioned about the con,    spiracy to commit the mutiny rather the charge    framed was conspiracy to commit murder, In reply    to the learned Advocate for the appellants, the    learned Attorney-General has submitted that the ey;.    dence of PWs as referred to by the learned defence    lawyer is of two-fold, one is relating to the circum.    stances prior to the occurrence and another is relat.    ed to the circumstance after the occurrence and thys    submitted that the evidence quoted by the learneg    defence Counsel cannot be taken to be an evidence    of mutiny rather it is the evidence of murder which    shall be taken into consideration in deciding the    case. According to the submission of learned    Attorney-General, the evidences on record and cir-    cumstances showed that the first object of the con-    spiracy was to kill Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur    Rahman and members of his family and, according-    ly, the convicts with pre-plan and pre-design came    out to kill Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman    and members of his family at House No.677, Road    No.32, Dhanmondi and to this end they mobilised    force for capturing radio station and other areas of    the city. The learned Attorney-General also asserted    that in the case of conspiracy in most cases direct    evidence is not normally found and it is proved by    the inference drawn from the circumstances and the    acts committed by the perpetrators in pursuance (0    their common design. He has referred to the deci-    sion of Shivnarayan Laxminarayan Joshi vs State of    Moharashtra reported in AIR 1980 SC 439 and    Mohd. Osman Mohammad Hossain Maniyur 8    State of Moharastra reported in AIR 1981 SC 1062.    In reply to the contention of the appellants, that al    the three learned Judges of the High Court Divisio\"    discarded the applicability of section 10 of M    Evidence Act and thus prosecution failed to prov’    the existence of criminal conspiracy through    application of section 10 of the Evidence Act, bot    the learned Attorney-General and Mr Anisul 104    have in unison submitted that section 10 of n    Evidence Act only makes certain fact relevant .    the purpose of conspiracy. On a clear reading section                              10 it appears that it is a Rule of evidence which    makes certain fact i.e. anything said, done or written    by any one of such persons (conspirator) in refer-    ence to their common intention after the time when    such intention was entertained as a relevant fact. In    the case of State of Maharashtra vs Damu Gopinath    shinde reported in AIR 2000 SC 1691, the Supreme    Court of India held that section 10 renders anything    said, done or written by anyone of the conspirators    in reference to their common intention as a relevant    fact, not only as against each of the conspirators but    for proving the existence of the conspiracy itself.    Further, the said fact can be used for showing that a    jcular person was a party to the conspiracy. The    only condition for application of the rule in section 10    is that there must be “reasonable ground to believe    that two or More persons have conspired together to    commit an offence.” The Supreme Court further held    that the basic principle which underlies in section 10    of the Evidence Act is the theory of agency and hence    every conspirator is an agent of his associate in car-    rying out the object of the conspiracy.        ",
      "359. In the case of Major EG Barsay vs State    of Bombay reported in AJR 1961 SC 1762, the    Supreme Court of India observed as follows:    <br>    “The scheme of the Act therefore is self-    evident. It applies to offences committed by    army personnel described is section 2 of the    Act; it creates new offences with specified pun-    ishments, imposes higher punishments to pre-    existing offences, and enables civil offences by    a fiction to be treated as offences under the Act;    it provides a satisfactory machinery for resolv-    ing the conflict of jurisdiction. Further it    enables, subject to certain conditions, an    accused to be tried successively both by Court    Martial and by a criminal Court, It does not    expressly bar the jurisdiction of criminal Courts    in respect of acts or omissions punishable under    the Act, if they are also punishable under any    other law in force in India; nor is it possible to    infer any prohibition by necessary implica-    tion.”                      ",
      "358. From the definitions of mutiny as con-    tained in section 35 of the Navy Ordinance, 1961.    we do not find that the prosecution has made out a    case of mutiny or there was any sign of failure of    command leading to mutiny rather from the evi-    dence of the witnesses both the Courts below, i.e.    the Court of Sessions and High Court Division, con-    currently found that the accused persons have com-    mitted conspiracy and murder. But both the Courts    have found that it is a case of murder and not a case    of mutiny leading to murder.        ",
      "357. We find that before pronouncement of    the judgment, the learned Sessions Judge vide his    order dated 24-3-1997 had served notice to con-    cerned authorities and the Army Headquarter as per    Provisions of Criminal Procedural Rules (Military    Offenders) 1958 vide Office Memo dated 2-4-1997    notifying that there is no bar to trying retired army    personnel in the criminal Court and thereby com-    plied with section 94 of the Army Act. So we do not    find any illegality as to the holding of trial before    criminal Court. (i.e. Sessions Court)        ",
      "356. Chapter 7 of the Penal Code provides for    offences relating to the Army, Navy and Air Force    and specifically, section 139 of the Penal Code pro-    yjges that persons subject to the aforesaid three    services are not subject to punishment under the    penal Code for any of the offences defined in    Chapter 7 . Section 5 of the Penal Code makes it    clear that any of the provisions of the Penal Code    does not intend to repeal, vary, suspend or affect any    of the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny        and desertion of officer, soldier or airman in the    service of Republic. So it appears that section 139 of    the Penal Code makes it abundantly clear that none    of the provisions of the Penal Code will repeal, vary    or affect the provision of any other law for punish-    ing mutiny. There is no difficulty for trial for mutiny    by the Court Martial if there is any such necessity. It    is well established that forum of trial is governed by    a procedural Jaw and the procedure followed by a    civil Court is much fairer and transparent then those    followed in the Court Martial and therefore there is    no chance of any prejudice to be caused to the    accused appellant. In the decision of the case of    Jamil Hug vs Bangladesh reported in 34 DLR (AD)    125 at page 138, paragraph 37 the Appellate    Division of the Supreme Court has quoted with    approval the observations of Prof. Holland pub-    lished in Law of Court Martial (Current Legal    Problem 1950 at page 193) which reads as follows:    <br>    “It is clear that present attitude of the    Courts whether justified by authority or not is in    favour of abdication controlling authority.    There is accordingly I suggest strong case for    the further reform I would accord-    ingly suggest that the jurisdiction of Court    Martial should be statutorily confined to the    offences against discipline and all the jurisdic-    tion over civil offences should be taken away    except where it is reasonable and impracticable    to arrange for a civil trial.”        ",
      "355. It also appears from the written State.    ment that none of the convict appellants, namely,    Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid    Khan, Mohiuddin (Artillery) at the time of examing.    tion under section 342 of the CrPC had made any    averment that the murders were committed in course    of mutiny. The evidences adduced in this case do not    show that the murders were committed in the course    of mutiny rather there was a conspiracy for commit.    ting murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur    Rahman and the members of his family and rela-    tions and that if anything had happened in the Army    it was after the commission of murder. The offence    of murder punishable under section 302 of the Penal    Code is not an offence under the Army Act rather it    is a civil offence as defined in section 8(2) of the    Army Act. Sub-section (2) of section 59 of the Army    Act envisages that a person subject to this Act com-    mits an offence of murder, culpable homicide not    amounting to murder or rape in relation to the per-    son not subject to the Army Act shall not be guilty    of an offence against the said Act and shall not be    dealt with under this Act unless he commits any of    the said offences while on active service or at any    place outside Bangladesh or at a frontier post speci-    fied by the Government. When a Criminal Court and    Court Martial have concurrent jurisdiction to try 4    civil offence then under section 94 of the Army Act    it is the discretion of the prescribed Officer to decide    before which Court the proceedings shall be inst!-    tuted, If he decides that it should be instituted before    a Court Martial, then he can direct that the accused    shall be detained in military custody. But in the    instant case, the prescribed officer has neither exe    cised his jurisdiction nor instituted the proceedings    before the Court’ Martial. Furthermore, the convict    appellants did not even raise any objection before    the criminal Court during trial. It is only for the prescribed                       officer to decide as to the forum of trial and,    4S guch, in the instant case, neither the prescribed    jcer nor the accused appellant challenged the    fort of the trial, rather in the Appellate Division,    at pelated stage, such a challenge is not tenable in    jaw. Since in the instant case, trial of a civil offence    pefore a criminal Court is found to be legal and valid        gas such, the argument advanced by the defence    is not tenable in law,        ",
      "354. From careful scrutiny of the aforesaid    statements of the PWs, it appears that the killing for    which the convict appellants and others were con-    victed and sentenced were not done in course of    mutiny. From the judgment of the first Hon'ble    Judge of the Division Bench, we found that there    was no mutiny in the Army in the night following            14th/early morning of 15th August, 1975 . The This    learned Judge also came to the same conclusion an    observed as under:        “From all this aforesaid evidences Of the    persons in authority and Army, Navy, Air Fotce    BDR, Police and Rakkhi Bahini having owed    the allegiances and no chain of command Wan    ever disturbed, there was no mutinous situation,    as contemplated in the aforesaid section.        ",
      "352. It has been well settled by the Appellate    Division of the Supreme Court in the case of Haider                      Ali Khan vs State reported in 1994 BLD (AD) 270 =    47 DLR (AD) 47 that the jurisdiction of Court below    cannot be challenged in appeal at a belated stage.    The learmed Attorney-General during the course of    his submission has also drawn our attention to the    cases where appellant Syed Faruque Rahman chal-    lenged the shifting of the Court in Writ Petition    No.2032 of 1997 which was reported in 49 DLR    (AD) 157 and the case of Sultan Shahriar Rashid    Khan and Syed Faruque Rahman which went upto    the Appellate Division reported in 3 BLC (AD) 89    where the accused appellant never challenged the    jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that the mur-    ders were committed in the course of mutiny.                ",
      "351. In the case of Balbir Singh vs Punjab    n 1995 1 SCC 90, the accused persons    the active service of the Air Force were        convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge under    sections 302 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code. It    was contended on behalf of the accused that since he    was in active service, he should be tried before the    Court Martial, The Supreme Court dismissed. the    appeal and observed as follows:  <br>      “When a criminal Court and Court-Martial    each have jurisdiction in respect of the trial of    the offence, it shall be the discretion of the offi-    cer commanding the group, wing or station in    which the accused in serving or such other offi-    cer as may be prescribed, in the first instance, to    decide before which Court the proceedings    shall be instituted and if that officer decides that    they should be instituted before a “Court    Martial”, to direct that the accused persons shall    be detained in Air Force custody. Thus, the    option to try a person subject to Air Force Act    who commits an offence while on “active serv-    ice” is in the first instance with the Air Force    Authorities. The criminal Court, when such an    accused is brought before it, shall not proceed    to try such a person or to inquire with a view to    this commitment for trial and shall give a notice    to the commanding officer of the accused, to    decide whether they would like to try the    accused by a Court Martial or allow the crimi-    nal Courts to proceed with the trial. In case, the    Air Force Authorities decide either not to try    such a person by a Court Martial or fail to exer-    cise the option when intimated by the criminal    Court within the period prescribed by Rule 4 of    the 1952 Rules, the accused can be tried by the    ordinary criminal Court in accordance with the    Code of Criminal Procedure. On the other hand,    if the Authorities under the Act opt to try the    accused by the ‘Court Martial’, the criminal    Court shall direct delivery of the custody of the    accused to the Authorities under the Act and to    forward to the authorities a statement of the    offence of which he is accused. It is explicit that    the option to try the accused subject to the Act    by a Court Martial is with the Air Force    Authorities and the accused has no option or    right to claim trial by a particular forum.”        ",
      "350. Thereafter the Judge handed over the    “ed to the Naval Authority which was chal-    gel 4, Supreme Court held that the Judge was cor-    lente handing over the accused persons to the    reo Authority after receiving reply from the    Nie anding Officer. In the case of Joginder Singh    a machal Pradesh reported in AIR 1971 SC 500    \" accused, a Lance Naik, raped a ten years old girl.    a was convicted under section 376 of the Indian    penal Code. The conviction was challenged before    the Appellate Court on the ground that section 549    of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been    complied with. While dismissing the appeal the    Supreme Court of India observed as under:        “In respect of an offence which could be    tried both by a criminal Court as well as Court    Martial, sections 125, 126 and the Rules have    made suitable provisions to avoid a conflict of    jurisdiction between the criminal Courts and the    Court Martial. But it is to be noted that in the    first instance, discretion is left to the officer    mentioned in section 125 to decide before    which Court the proceedings should be institut-    ed. Hence, the officer commanding the army,    army corps, division or independent brigade in    which the accused person is serving or such    other officer as may be prescribed will have to    exercise his discretion and decide under section    125 in which Court the proceedings shall be    instituted. It is only when he so exercises his    discretion that the proceeding should be insti-    tuted before a Court Martial, that the provisions    of section 126(1) come into operation, If the    designated officer does not exercise his discre-    tion and decide that the proceedings should be    nstituted before a Court Martial, the Army Act    Would not obviously be in the way of a criminal    Court exercising it’s ordinary jurisdiction in the    manner provided by law.”        ",
      "349. From the aforesaid provisions of sections    94 and 95 of the Army Acct it appears that in the case    of murder there is concurrent jurisdiction by both    the Court Martial and the ordinary criminal Cour.    But section 59(2) of the Army Acct stipulates that a    case of murder cannot be tried under the Army Act    if the victims are not subject to the Army Act unless    the accused commits the offence while on active    service or at any place outside Bangladesh or at a    frontier post specified by the Government. It also    appears that application of section 59(1) is also lim-    ited by section 92(2) of the Army Act which pro-    vides that trial shall commence within 6 months    after he had ceased to be subject to this Act. It tra    spires that in the instant case there is concurrent    jurisdiction, the Sessions Court had complied with    all formalities necessary under sections 94 and 95 of    the Army Act and section 549 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure by sending notice to the Chief    of Staff, Army under Rule 2 of Criminal Procedure    Rules (Military Offenders) 1958 with regards to th?    trial of the accused persons as evidenced by ° i\"    No.12 dated 3-4-1997 . In the case of MSK /bral™    Commander in Chief, Royal Pakistan Navy repo    in 8 DLR (SC) 128 the accused, an official a    Pakistan Navy, was charged with theft and was     produced before the Special Judge who addressed vi    ter to the Commanding Officer, in accordance with                      section 549 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,    <oction whether the appellant was to be tried by a    eng’ \"Martial or the Judge himself.        ",
      "348. It is also necessary to reproduce section    549 of the CrPC which reads as under:    <br>    “549 . Delivery to military authorities of    person liable to be tried by Court Martial, (1)    The Government may make rules consistent    with this Code and the Bangladesh Army Act,    1952 (XXXIX of 1952), the Bangladesh Air    Force Act, 1953 (VI of 1953), and the    Bangladesh Navy Ordinance, 1961 (XXXV of    1961), and any similar law for the time being in    force as to the cases in which persons subject to    military, naval or air force law, shall be tried by    a Court to which the Code applies, or by Court    Martial, and when any person is brought before        a Magistrate and charged with an Offer    which he is liable, to be tried either b Nee ig    to which this Code applies or by Court yoo\"    such Magistrate shall have regard to sug Arti)    and shall in proper cases deliver him,\"    with a statement of the offence of which Bethe,    accused, to the commanding officer Of the Cis    ment, corps, ship or detachment, to Which    belongs, or to the commanding officer of e    nearest military, naval or air force Station, as the    case may be, for the purpose of being tried :    Court Martial. y      <br>  (2) Apprehension of such persons.

      "347. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned    Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the respon-    dent, has submitted that in the instant case the    offence of murder has been tried and no charge of    mutiny has been brought against the accused appel-    Jants. The learned Judges of the Division Bench as    well as the Third learned Judge upon consideration    of evidence and materials on record have not found    any case of mutiny rather they found the case of    murder and accordingly, they have awarded their    verdict. He has argued that raising the issue of    mutiny by the defence to challenge the jurisdiction    of the trial Court at the appellate stage for the first    time is not tenable in law. He has referred to the case    of Haider Ali Khan vs State reported in 1994 BLD    (AD) 270 = 47 DLR (AD) 47 and the case of    Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto vs State reported in PLD 1979    SC 53 . Mr Attorney-General having referred to the    Writ Petition No.2032 of 1997 filed on behalf of the    appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque    Rahman, challenging the sitting of the Court to    Nazim Uddin Road which has gone upto the    Appellate Division having been reported in 49 DLR    (AD) 157 and also the Writ Petition submitted on    behalf of the appellant Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan    and Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,    challenging the vires of the Indemnity Repeal Act,    1997 in the High Court Division which has gone        Upto the Appellate Division reported in 3 BLC (AD)    89 has submitted that the accused appellant had    never challenged the jurisdiction of the Court on the        round that it was a case of mutiny leading to mur-    der not a case of murder simplictter and, as such the    appellant’s contention that the civil Court has no    jurisdiction to try the offence of murder is not ten-    able in law. The learned Attorney-General has    drawn our attention to the refusal of the first Judge    in granting leave to make submission on the point of    mutiny since the prosecution has no case of mutiny    but a case of murder committed in the fateful night    of 14th August and the early hours of 15th August,    1975 . Mr Mahbubey Alam has also referred to the    conclusions and observations made by the Third    learned Judge. The learned Attorney-General having    drawn our attention to the written statements made    by the convict appellants, namely, Lieutenant    Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar    Rashid Khan and Mohiuddin (Artillery), have sub-    mitted that none of the appellants made any aver-    ment to the effect that murders were committed in    course of mutiny. He has also reiterated the submis-    sions made by Mr Anisul Hug to the same effect that    since in the instant case neither any discretion was    exercised in taking a decision by the prescribed offi-    cer under section 94 of the Army Act nor any ques-    tion was raised by the convict appellants in the trial    Court as to the forum of trial and, as such, the con-    vict appellants are not entitled to challenge the    forum of trial for the first time in the Apex Court. In    this context Mr Attorney-General has referred to the    case of Major EG Barsay vs State of Bombay    reported in AJR 1961 SC 1762 . Having referred to    the case of Jamil Hug vs Bangladesh reported in 34    DLR (AD) 125, he has submitted that forum of trial    being governed by a procedural law and the proce-    dure followed in Civil Court is much fairer and    transparent than that the procedure followed in    Court Martial, the question of prejudice to the con-    vict appellant does not arise at all. The offence of    mutiny has not been defined in the Army Act, 1952.    But section 31 of the Army Act provides for punish-    ment for the offence of mutiny and insubordination.    However, mutiny is defined under section 35 of the    Naval Ordinance, 1961 . According to section 94 of    the Army Act, a criminal Court under Court Martial    has jurisdiction in respect of a Civil offence and the    prescribed officer has discretion to decide as to    which Court the proceedings shall be instituted and    if that officer decides that the proceedings shall be                      instituted before the Court Martial then he will    direct that the accused persons shall be detained in    military custody. Sections 94 and 95 of the Army    Act, 1952 and section 549 of the CrPC set out the    procedure in the case of concurrent jurisdiction of    Court Martial and Criminal Court. In this context it    Will be profitable to quote sections 94 and 95 of the    Army Act which are as follows:    <br>    “04 . When a criminal Court and a Court    Martial have each jurisdiction in respect of a    civil offence, it shall be in the discretion of the    prescribed officer to decide before which Court    the proceedings shall be instituted and, if that    officer decides that they shall be instituted    before a Court Martial, to direct that the    accused person shall be detained in military    custody.      <br>  95.(1) When a criminal Court having juris-    diction is of the opinion that proceedings ought    to be instituted before itself in respect of any    civil offence, it may, by written notice, require    the prescribed officer, at his option, either to    deliver over the offender to the nearest magis-    trate to be proceeded against according to law, or    to postpone proceedings pending a reference to    the Government. (2) In every such case, the said    officer shall either deliver over the offender in    compliance with the requisition or shall forth-    with refer the question as to the Court before    which the proceedings are to be instituted for the    determination of the Government, whose order    upon such reference shall be final.”        ",
      "346. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Advocate    appearing for the respondent has submitted that the    present case not being a case of mutiny rather a case    of murder simpliciter, no illegality was committed    by trying the accused appellants in the Criminal    Court because, even if for the sake of argument,    though not conceding, along with mutiny there was    also murder, Mr Huq has submitted that in case o!    civil offence like murder there was a concurrent    jurisdiction both in the Court Martial and Criminal    Court as per provisions of sections 94 and 95 of the    Army Act and the formalities required thereunder    along with section 549 of the CrPC have been fully    complied with and, as such, no illegality is commit    ted by holding the trial of the case in a crim    Court. Mr Anisul Huq has submitted that the a    ment in the leave granting order No.3 to the     that ‘“‘whether there is mutiny leading to murder or                      murder simpliciter” is misconceived because for    murder like the present case there is concurrent    jurisdiction under section 59(2) of the Army Act,    952 . He then has submitted that in the instant case    ore being concurrent jurisdiction the Sessions    court having fully complied with the provisions of    eections 94 and 95 of the Army Act and section 549    of the CrPC as evidenced by the Sessions Court's    rdet dated 24-3-1997 and 3-4-1997 held the trial    and, such, no illegality is committed in holding    the trial. In this context he has referred to the deci-    <jons in the cases of MSK Ibrat vs Commander-in-    chief Royal Pakistan Navy reported in 4 DLR (SC)    128, Balbir Singh vs Punjab reported in 1995 1 SCC 90.

      "345. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned    Asvocate appearing for the appellants in Criminal    Appeal Nos.56 and 58 of 2007, submits that on a    clear analysis of the evidence and materials on    record it appears that the instant case is a case of    mutiny leading to murder of the President,    Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and mem-    bers of his family and relations and not a case of    murder simpliciter and, as such, the conviction of    the accused appellants by a normal criminal Court    instead of Court Martial has vitiated the trial. Mr    Khan has argued that series of events, activities,    briefings, exercises and happenings, having had    happened in Dhaka Cantonment in the night preced-    ing the fateful event occurring in the House No. 677,    Road No. 32, Dhanmondi, clearly constituted    mutiny and it does not indicate any case of murder    simpliciter. The place of occurrence includes the    cantonment and the cantonment activities, briefings    and exercises include the fact of the case and as    such, no case of agreement or pre-arranged plan,    pre-concert, common intention, criminal conspiracy    or object for common intention within the scope of    section 34 or section 120A of the Penal Code can be        lawfully inferred. Mr Khan then submits that killing    of persons in the course of mutiny is triable by a    Court Martial and in this context he has referred to    section 59 of the Army Act, 1952 and submits that    since the accused persons were in active service at    the time of the commission of offence, they should    have been in all fairness tried before a Court Martial    instead of criminal Court: In this context he has    referred to the case of Jamil Huq vs Bangla)    reported in 34 DLR 161 (AD) 125 and sub its be    for the mutiny which took place in the     29th/30th May, 1981 resulting in death of 7; of    Rahman, President of Bangladesh trial Was ete    exclusively by a Court Martial as per Provision    section 31 of the Army Act and, as such, the tire    of the President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on the    fateful night of the 15th August by the Army per-    sonnel who were in active service should have been    tried by a Court Martial instead of a criminal Court    and, as such, the conviction and sentence Of the    accused appellant is not tenable in law. Mr Khan hag    argued that the severity of penalty in case Of mutiny    and in case of murder not being the same and the    difference is to the advantage of the appellants in a    trial by Court Martial since in the case of Punish.    ment for murder there is only one alternative of    death penalty to imprisonment for life. He has    argued that under section 31 of the Army Act any    sentence alternative to death sentence carries much    lesser punishment as mentioned in the Army Act,    1952 . Mr Khan Saifur Rahman has submitted that    the plea of concurrent jurisdiction by the respondent    for the trial of the case by criminal Court or the    Court Martial basing on the provisions of sections    91 and 92 of the Army Act, 1952 had lost its force in    view of the proviso to section 92(2) of the Army Act    and that the question of concurrent jurisdiction of    trial of the case is misconceived.

      "344. Mahim Mondal vs State reported in 15    DLR 615 . In this case the appellant, Mahim Mondal,    along with other accused persons were tried under    sections 304 and 148 and various other sections. of    the Penal Code. Mahim Mondal was convicted    under sections 304 and. 148 of the Penal Code and    sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five    years and one year respectively. Accused Asab    Mondal was convicted under section 323 of the    Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigorous impris-    onment for six months, Appellant Mohim Mondal    preferred an appeal against the conviction and sen-    tence passed against him. Upon admission of the    appeal, a Division Bench issued a suo motu Rule    asking to show cause as to why the conviction and    sentence passed against the accused under the said    Code should not be set aside. The revision case aris-    es out of the Rule which was issued by the same    Court. After hearing the appeal and the revision case    a Division Bench differed in their opinion as to                      whether the accused Mahim Mondal could have    been convicted of rioting. Consequently, the matter    was laid before the Third Judge, Morshed, J under    section 429 of the CrPC In his judgment Morshed, J    held that the whole case is required to be laid before    the Third Judge and it is his duty to consider all the    points involved before he delivers his opinion upon    the case. State vs Abul Khair reported in 44 DLR    284 . In this case two Judges of the Division Bench    differed on the validity of conviction and sentence    of two appellants but agreed in respect of conviction    of one accused, namely, Abul Khair. The case was    laid before the Third Judge. The Third learned Judge    only dealt with the case of the two accused, namely,    Mosharraf and Moinuddin i.e. with regards to whom    the Judges had differed.        ",
      "343. In the case of Granade Venkata vs    Corporation of Calcutta reported in 22 CWN 745    the accused was prosecuted and convicted under    section 495A(1) of the Calcutta Municipal Act for    selling adulterated ghee. The Magistrate allowed the    defence to rely on this evidence which was obtained    by cross-examination of the Assistant Analyst to the    Corporation who applied certain processes of analy-    sis to the sample of ghee in question and obtained    certain results from which he made the deduction    that the ghee had been adulterated with certain per-    Centages of foreign fat. No other witness has been    ¢xamined on either side and the defence contended    that according to the standard works on the subject    no such deduction could be made. Defence cross-    examined the analyst. The Magistrate allowed the    defence to rely on this evidence, dealt with it as    being the evidence in the judgment. The Rule,    against the conviction was heard before two Judges,    both of whom agreed that the conviction could not    stand. Chitty, J was for a retrial on the ground that    there was no satisfactory investigation and Smither,    J held otherwise. The matter was laid before the    Third Judge Woodroffe, J who held that in a case    referred under. section 420, CrPC, a Third Judge    would not differ upon a point on which both the    referring Judges were agreed unless there were    Strong grounds for doing so. In the case of    Muhammed Shafi vs Crown reported in 6 DLR (WP)    /04 the full Bench of the High Court held that nei-    ther section 378 nor section 429 prevents the obtain-    ing of the decision of the full Bench upon a question    of law or subsequent delivery of the opinion of the    Third Judge upon the whole case. The Third Judge    before whom the case is laid under section 429 of    the Criminal Procedure Code exercise the authority    of a Bench of Judges and therefore, he should be    considered not as a single Judge, but as a Bench.    The case is not one which is dealt with in fact by a    single Judge, but one which is dealt with by three    Judges, even though the Third Judge is dealing with    it at a later stage then the two disagreeing Judges.        ",
      "342. When the appeal as a whole is heard by    the Third Judge, he not only has an option of deliy-    ering his opinion but, under the proviso to section    302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he may    require the appeal to be re-heard and decided by a    larger Bench of Judges. This was an option which,    under the proviso, was also open for any one of the    two Judges, namely, BN Katju and Rajeshwar    Singh, JJ to exercise, but they chose not to do so,    What is clearly evident is that the appeal is finally    disposed of by the judgment and order which fol-    lows the opinions of the Third Judge. This being so    special leave petition could only have been filed    afier the appeal was disposed of by the High Court    yield its final order dated 19-5-1988 . Even though    the said order purports to relate only to ten out of    thirty-two accused the said order has to be read    along with the earlier order of 15-4-1987 and, in    law, the effect would be that the order dated 19-5-    1988 will be regarded as the final order whereby the    appeal of the State was partly allowed, with only    two of the thirty-two accused being convicted under    section 325 read with 34 IPC, while all the other    accused were acquitted.”        ",
      "341. In the case of State of UP vs Dan Sing    reported in (1997) 3 SCC 747 32 accused persons    were charged under sections 147, 302/ 149, 43 6iige    307/149 of the Indian Penal Code and under se    tions 4(iv), (x) and section 5.7 of the Protection, *    the Civil Rights Act, 1955 . The Sessions Jud  acquitted all the 32 accused persons including Dan    Singh and others. State preferred appeal before the    High Court, Allahabad. Katju, J convicted two    accused, namely, Jit Singh and Kishan Sing unde,    sections 325 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code ang    sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for    five years and acquitted 30 accused Persons. By a    separate opinion Rajeshwar Singh, J convicteg six    accused men and four ladies and acquitted 2)    accused persons. The first order was of the Division    Bench regarding the acquittal of 22 accused persons.    Thereafter the case was laid before the Third learned    Judge. The Third learned Judge Mathur, J after hear-    ing the appeal of ten accused to which the two    learned Judges differed, agreed with Katju, J con.    victing two accused, namely, Jit Singh and Kishan    Sing and acquitted 30 accused persons. One special    leave petition was filed by the State against all the    32 accused persons. Leave was not granted in the    case of 4 ladies and accordingly their acquittal has    become finality and leave was granted against 28    accused persons. Supreme Court of India observed    as under:        “According to this section if there is a dif-    ference of opinion amongst the Judges of the    Bench, then their Opinions are laid before        another Judge. It is only after the Third Judge    gives his opinion that the judgment or order fol-    lows. It is clear from this that the judgment of    order which can be appealed against, undet    Article 136 of the Constitution, is only th!    Which follows after the opinion of the Lat    Judge has been delivered. What BN Katju an                       Rajeshwar Singh, JJ. wrote was not their judg-    ments but they were their opinions, Due to dis-    agreement amongst them, section 392 of the    Code of Criminal Procedure required the appeal    as a Whole to be laid before the Third Judge (vs    Pp Mathur, J in this case) whose opinion was to    prevail. The first order of 15-4-1987 was clear-    ly not contemplated by section 392 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure and is, therefore, non est.        ",
      "340. In the case of Nemai Mondal ys State of    West Bengal reported in AJR 1966 . Calcuting 194    there were ten appellants. Both the learned Judges of    the Division Bench were unanimous that the con-    viction of the appellant Nos.1, 9 and 19 sh    set aside. Therefore appellant Nos.1, 9 and |    been set at liberty and there is no difference of has    ion about them. The difference of opinio Din,    comes up for decision is with respect to appt at    Nos.2-8 were dealt by the Third Judge. Mukhags.    held that the case with the differing Opinion she    be placed before the Third Judge.         ",
      "339. In the case of Sarat Chandra Mitra vs    Emperor reported in ILR 38 Cal 2002 the learned    Judges of the Division Bench are equally divided in    respect of one of the accused, Sarat Chandra Mitra    and the matter was laid before the Third Judge. The    Supreme Court of India held that in the case of two    prisoners, regarding the guilt of one of whom only    the Judges of the Appellate Court are divided in    opinion, it may be that what has to be laid before    another Judge is the case of such prisoner alone, But    where they are equally divided as the guilt of one    accused, though in certain aspects they may be    agreed, the whole case as regards the accused is laid    before the Third Judge, and not merely the point or    points on which there is difference of Opinion, and it    is his duty to consider all the points involved before    . delivering his opinion upon the case,        ",
      "338. In Radha Mohan Singh vs State of UP    (2006) 2 SCC 450 five accused persons were con-    victed under sections 147, 148, 323, 324 and 302    read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and    imposed sentence of various terms of imprisonment    includingNife imprisonment under section 302 read    with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The    accused appellant preferred appeal in the Allahabad    High Court. In the Division Bench, first learned    Judge Agarwal, J allowed the appeal and set aside    the conviction and sentence imposed thereunder but    the second Judge Mishra, J dismissed the appeal and    thereby upheld the conviction and sentence passed    by the leamed Sessions Judge. The matter was    referred to the Third Judge who upheld the convic-    tion for all. On appeal, the Supreme Court held that    the Third learned Judge is under no obligation to    accept the view of one of the Judges holding in    favour of acquittal of the accused either as a rule of    prudence or on the scope of judicial etiquette. It is    not possible to accept the contention raised by the    appellant.        ",
      "337. In the case of Mattar vs State of UP    (2002) 6 SCC 460 two accused persons were con-    victed under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian Penal    Code, one of the accused died during the pendency    of the appeal before the High Court. In High Court    first Judge acquitted the appellant and the second    Judge convicted him. The matter was referred to the    Third Judge who dismissed the appeal and convict-    ed the accused appellant. The Supreme Court of    India held that the Third learned Judge, under these    circumstances, was required to independently examine                      the matter and express his opinion. It is not per-    missible to only or merely indicate the agreement    with one or the other view without giving reasons    therefor.        ",
      "336. In the case of Sajjan Singh vs State of    MP reported in (1999) 1 SCC 315 at page-324 para-    10 the Supreme Court held that it is the Third Judge    whose opinion matters; against the judgment that    follows therefrom that an appeal lies to the Supreme    Court by way of special leave petition under Article    136 of the Constitution or under Article 134 of the    Constitution or under section 379 of the Code.

      "335. Mr Justice GN Ray observed as under:        “In, Babu vs State of Uttar Pradesh, (AIR    1965 SC 1467), it has been held by Constitution    Bench of this Court that where the Third Judge    did not consider it necessary to decide a partic-    ular point on which there had been difference of    opinion between the two Judges, but simply    indicated that if at all it was necessary for him    to come to a decision on the point, he agreed    with all that had been said about by one of the    two Judges, such decision was in conformity    with law. That the Third Judge is free to decide    the appeal in the manner he thinks fit, has been    reiterated in, Hethubha vs State of Gujarat,    (AIR 1970 SC 1266) and Union of India vs BN    Anantha Padma Nabiah, AIR 1971 SC 1836 . In    State of A. PV PT Appaiah, AIR 1981 SC 365, it    has been held by this Court that even in a case    when both the Judges had held that the accused    was guilty but there was difference of opinion    as to the nature of offence committed by the    accused, it was open to the Third Judge to    decide the appeal by holding that the accused    was not guilty by considering the case on    merit.”        ",
      "334. In the case of Tanviben Pankajkumar    Divetia vs State of Gujarat reported in AJR 1997    SCC 7156 the accused appellant was convicted    under section 302 read with section 34 of the Indian    Penal Code against which he preferred appeal    before the Gujarat High Court. A Division Bench of    the High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by    the State against the acquittal of the appellant of the    charges levelled under section 302 read with section    120B of the Penal Code and section 302 of the    Indian Penal Code. One Judge acquitted the accused    and the other Judge convicted the accused, The mat-    ter was referred to Third Judge. The Third learned    Judge upheld the conviction of the appellant under    section 302 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, the    appeal of the appellant was dismissed by the High    Court. On appeal, the Supreme Court of India held    that:    “it is for the Third Judge to decide on. what    points he shall hear arguments, if any, and it    necessarily postulates that the Third Judge is    free to decide the appeal by resolving the dif-    ference in the manner he thinks proper.”        ",
      "333. In the case of State of Andhra Pradesh vs    PT Appaiah reported in AJR 1981 SC 265 . two    accused persons were convicted under sections 302    and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced     of them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life. \"    appeal the Division Bench Judges differed the    nature of the offence that was committed by '    accused in causing the injury. Madhava Reddy’    held punishable under section 304 Part of     Penal Code and Sriramula, J dismissed the appeal                      holding that the Sessions Judge rightly convicted the    accused under sections 302 and 34 of the Indian    Penal Code. But the Third Judge Ramchandra Raju,    J acquitted both the accuseds. Supreme Court held    that the Third Judge before whom the case was laid    for opinion is competent to deal with the whole case    and he is not bound to confine his judgment only to    the matter conceming difference of opinion between    the other two Judges. The Supreme Court have    relied with observations made in the case of Union    of India vs BN Anantha Padma Nabiah reported in    AIR 1971 SC 1836 which runs as follows:      <br>  “This question came up for consideration    in the recent unreported decision in Hethubha    vs State Of GujfArdt    This Court held that the Third learned Judge    could deal with the whole case. The language of    section 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure    is explicit that the case with the opinion of the    Judges comprising the Court of Appeal shall be    laid before another Judge of the same Court.    The other noticeable feature in section 429 of    the Code of Criminal Procedure is that the judg-    ment or order shall follow the opinion of the    Third learned Judge.”        ",
      "332. In the case of Union of India vs BN    Anantha Padma Nabiah reported in AIR 1971 SC    1836 there was difference of opinion regarding all    the accused persons. Reference was made to the    Third Judge. In this case Supreme Court considered    the case of Bhagat Ram vs State of Rajasthan report-    ed in (1972) 3 SCR 303 where the Third Judge held    that Bhagat Ram was guilty of the offence under    section 389 and also sections 120B, 218 and 347 of    the Indian Penal Code. It has been held that it was    not permissible for the Third Judge to re-open the    matter and convict Bhagat Ram of the offences    under section 120B and 218 of the Indian Penal    Code as the Division Bench comprising the first and    second Judge confirmed the acquittal of Bhagat    Ram in respect of charge under sections 347, 218,    389 and 120B of the Penal Code. In the case 4,    entire matter relating to acquittal of conviction ang    sentence of Bhagat Ram had not been left ope,    because of difference of opinion between the two    Judges. The Supreme Court of India in the case gf    Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in AIR 1979    SC 1266 observed that the scope of section 429    CrPC was not confirmed in Bhagat Ram’s case, No    question was raised whether the Judges of the    Division Bench restrict the power of the Third Judge    under section 429 nor the notice of the Court    appears to have been drawn to three earlier dec).    sions of the Court on the point, namely, in the case    of Babu vs State of UP reported in AIR 1966 sc    1467, Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in 4/p    1970 SC 1266 and Union of India vs BN Anantha    Padma Nabiah reported in AJR 1971 SC 1836 which    was unreported when Bhagat Ram’s case was decid-    ed. Having considered all these three cases the    Supreme Court tried in the case of Babu vs State of    UP reported in AIR 1966 SC 1467 held that section    429, CrPC contemplates that it is for the Third Judge    to decide on what points he shall hear arguments, if    any, and that postulates that he is completely free in    resolving the difference as he thinks fit. In the case    of Hethubha vs State of Gujarat reported in AIR    1970 SC 1266 the Supreme Court having considered    the decision reported in AJR 1965 SC 1467 held that    two things are noticeable in section 429 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure: firstly, the case shall be laid    before another Judge, and, Secondly, the judgment    and order will follow the opinion of the Third    learned Judge. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held    that the Third learned Judge can or will deal with the    whole case and that the Third learned Judge    whom the case was referred under section 429 has    not overstated the limits in deciding the case as @    whole. The appeal was dismissed accordingly.        ",
      "331. In the case of Babu vs State of the UP    reported in AJR 1965 SC 1467, the appeal was    against conviction and sentence’ of four accused    appellants under sections 304 and 34 of the Indian    Penal Code. First learned Judge dismissed the    appeal disbelieving some part of the evidence and -    the second learned Judge allowed the appeal. The    Supreme Court of India held that section 429 of the    Code of Criminal Procedure contemplates that it is    for the Third Judge to decide on what points he shall    hear arguments if any and that postulates that he was |completely free in resolving difference as he thinks     fit. In the case of Hethubha vs State of Gujarat    reported in AIR 1970 SC 1266 the trial Court acquit-    ted all the three accused persons under sections 302    read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code but    convicted all the accused persons ‘for the offences                      punishable under sections 304 Part-2 read with sec-    tion 34 and sentenced them to suffer rigorous    imprisonment for five years. Accused No.1-    Hethubha and No.2-Ranubha were convicted for the    offences punishable under section 323 and accused    No.3-Malubha was convicted for the offence pun-    ishable under section 323 read with section 34 of the    Indian Penal Code. The accused Nos.1 and 2 were    sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three    months while accused No.2 was sentenced for two    months and all the sentences were to run concur-    rently, All the accused preferred appeals against    their convictions before the Division Bench in the    Hich Court of Gujarat. Divan, J held that accused    No.1 was guilty for the offence under section 302    and accused Nos.2 and 3 were found guilty under    section 324 read with section 34 . Shelat, J acquitted    all the accused because he was not satisfied with the    evidence of proof of the identity of the accused. The    case was placed before the Third learned Judge    Mehta, J under section 429 of the Code who found    accused No.1 guilty under section 302 and accused    Nos.2 and 3 guilty under section 302 read with sec-    tion 34 and all of them were sentenced to suffer rig-    orous imprisonment for life. The conviction of    accused Nos.] and 2 under section 323 and of the    accused No.3 under section 323 read with section 34    was upheld. The conviction of all the accuseds    under section 304 Part-2 was altered as stafed above.    On appeal, the Supreme Court of India held that the    Third Judge was competent to deal with the whole    case.        ",
      "330. During the course of hearing the learned    Advocates from both sides have made elaborate    submissions on the scope and jurisdiction of the    Third learned Judge. It has come to our notice that    Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned Advocate in    Criminal Appeal Nos.56 of 2007 and    Whose arguments have been adopted by the learned    Advocate for the other appellants, has referred to the    case reported in 1999 SCC (CRI) 44, ILR 38 Cal    202, 1970 (1) SCC (Cr) 280, 1971 SCC (Cri) 535,    15 DLR 615 and he has also submitted that the    expression “as he thinks fit” does not qualify the    word “hearing” and there is no co-relation between    “hearing” and “as he thinks fit” and accordingly he    has submitted that for breach of the provisions of    section 377 of the Code for not signing the judgment    by two Judges, there is no judgment in the eye of    law. As such the judgment and order of conviction    and sentence is not tenable in law. From our careful    scrutiny we have found that the same cases are also    relied on by the respondents in support of their con-    tentions. It would be profitable for us to examine the    relevant decisions in this context. In the case of    Dharam Singh vs State of UP reported in 1964 (1)    CrLJ 78, there was difference regarding all the    accuseds. In this case trial Judge convicted ten    accused persons under sections 302 and 149 of the    Indian Penal Code and acquitted two accused per-    sons. The State appealed against acquittal and ten    accused persons preferred appeal against convic-    tion. A Division Bench of the High Court differed in    their opinions and the matter was laid before the    Third learned Judge who concurring with one of the    Judges upheld the conviction of ten appellants and    set aside the acquittal of one accused, where the    judgment and order of the Court has followed the    opinion of Third learned Judge.        ",
      "329. From the above expressions we find that    the words “of the same Court” after the words    “nother Judge” and the. expression “if any” after    the expression “such hearing” do not exist in section    378 . By adding these two expressions in section 429    of the Code the legislature intended to say that when    the Judges of the Division Bench are equally divid-    ed in opinion while disposing appeal, the case with    their opinions thereon shall be laid before another        Judge of the same Court. Thereby meaning a Judge.        of the appellate Court who is “completely free” to.    decide on what points he shall hear arguments if any    and that Third learned Judge is free to decide the    appeal by resolving the differences in the manner he    thinks proper.        ",
      "328. Mr Ajmalul Hossain, the learned    AGvosate appearing for the respondent-State as spe-    cial prosecutor, has referred to. us Chapter XXVII of    the CrPC which contains the provisions in respect of    the submissions of sentence for confirmation and    also Chapter XXXI under Part 7 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure which contains provisions of    eppeals arising out of the judgment and order of    cnminal Court. He has submitted that from the    scheme of the law Chapter XXVII of the Code con-    lains detailed provisions for submissions of the pro-    ceedings to the High Court Division when the Court    of Sessions passes the death sentence and the sen-    tence of death shall not be executed unless it is con-        firmed by the High Court Division, Referring to the    Scheme of the        mitted that by laying down the eave with thoi a        Jone Wefore the ‘Third learned Judge of the he    Court means appeal has to come to a linvality | Hi    High Court Division \\nlons WO Judes Hive t    eonsent and that the Third learned Judge jy ree ih    the expresalon “such hearing (iP any) ay he thin    tit refers to the situation where itis up to the 4    learned Judge's discretion to decide ag tg hoy ut    will hear the case as he thinks fit and that POstily,    that the Third Judge is completely free jp resolv    the decision as he thinks fit, In other Words i    Hossain has strived hard to argue that g¢    read with section 429 of the CrPC contem    it is for the Third Judge to decide on what Points p,,    shall hear the arguments if any, Accordingly, he has    asserted that there is no illegality in the Pinion py        nounced by the Third learned Judge in de    consider the case of the aforesaid six CONVict pep    sons about whom there was difference of Opinion    Without hearing the other convict appellants jp    detail. Chapter XXVII of the Code of Criming    Procedure provides for submission of sen    confirmation. Section 374 of the Code    that where the Sessions J udge passes the sentence      unless it is confirmed by the High Cour    Division. So it is mandatorily required to submit the    proceedings before the High Court Division for con.    firmation of death sentence, Section 377 of the Code    contemplates that the confirmation of sentence shall    be made and signed by at least two Judges of the    High Court Division. But when the Judges of the    High Court Division are equally divided in their    opinion, according to provision of section 378 of the    Code, “the case with their opinions thereon shall be    another Judge and such Judge after    such hearing as he thinks fit shall deliver his opinion    nent and order shall follow such opin-    1e scheme of the law it appears thal    XI under Part VII of the CrPC contains        ccused person convicted on a trial held |                      is a well established principles of law that once a    criminal appeal is admitted it must be decided on    verits and cannot be dismissed for non prosecution    yen if the appellant or his Advocate remains absent    in the Court at the time of hearing of the appeal, the    p ellate Court cannot avoid its responsibility or    uty from perusing the record of the case and giving    reasons in deciding the matter on merit. When the    rudges of the Divition Bench as the Court of appeal    e equally divided in opinion, ‘the case with their    opinions thereon shall be laid before another Judge”    of the same Court and such Judge after such hearing    ‘any as he thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and    the judgment and order shall follow such opinion.    From 2 careful reading of the provision of section    378 vis-a-vis section 429 of the Code it appears that    though the provisions in both these sections are    identical in nature, when the Judges of a Division    Bench are equally divided in their opinion yet sec-    tion 429 envisages that “the case, with their opinions    thereon shall be laid before another Judge of the    same Court and such Judge after such hearing (if    any) as he thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and the    judgment and order shall follow such opinion”.

He has argued that in case of split judg-    ment, the question of signing of the judgment by at    least two Judges as provided in section 377 is not    applicable in view of the decision of the case of    Babu vs State of UP reported in AIR 1963 SC 1467.    As regards power and jurisdiction of the Third    learned Judge the learned Attorney-General has    referred to the decision of the case of Sarat Chandra    Mitra vs Emperor reported in 15 CWN 18 = ILR 38    Cal 202, Ibrahim vs State reported in PLD 1959    (WP) Lahore 715, the case of Mahim Mondal vs    State reported in /5 DLR. 615, Sajjan Singh vs    Modhya Pradesh reported in AIR 1998 SC 2756 and    the unreported decision in our jurisdiction in the    case of State vs Md Foysal Alam Ansari and others    in Death Reference No.81 of 2003 with Criminal                      Appeal no this point the learned picid    ad uhert istons of superior Court.

      "325. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned    Attorney-General, has also made identical submis-    sion like Mr Anisul Huq in respect of the scope and    jurisdiction of the Third learned Judge. He has sub-    mitted that when the Judges of a Division Bench are    equally divided in opinion and not concurrent the    provisions of sections 378 and 429 of the CrPC are    applicable, and accordingly, he referring to the pro-    visions of section 378 of the CrPC has submitted    that when the Judges of the Division Bench are    divided in their opinion, the case with their opinions    thereon shall be laid before another Judge of the    same Court and such Judge after such hearing as he    thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and the judgment    and order shall follow such opinion and thereby the    opinion of the Third learned Judge shall reach to its    finality becoming the judgment of the Court.        ",
      "324. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Advocate    sgring for the respondent-State, has referred to    ihe provisions of sections 377, 378 and 429 of the    pc and has submitted that the decided cases of    pangladesh, Pakistan and India demonstrate that the    Third learned Judge has been endowed with wide    giscretion to decide how to deal with the case and    that it is completely the Third learned Judge’s dis-    cretion as to how he will hear the case, (and in the    manner) as he thinks fit. He then submits that where    there are more than one accused in the case and the    jeamed Judges of the Division Bench are equally    divided on their opinion then the case of the accused    as to whom the Judges are equally divided on their    point shall be laid before the Third leamed Judge    and, on the other hand, when the learned Judges are    equally divided with regard to all the accuseds then    the whole case with regard to the accuseds is    referred to the Third learned Judge. In this context    Mr Hug has argued that the cases of the Sub-    Continent are divided into two groups, firstly, where    there are difference of opinion in respect of all the    accuseds and the cases where there are difference of    opinion either on evidence or on points of law relat-    ing to conviction or acquittal regarding some of the    accuseds. In this context Mr Huq has referred to the    decisions of the cases of Dharam Singh vs State of    UP reported in 1964 (1) CrLJ 78, Babu vs State of    UP reported in AIR 1965 SC 1467, Hethubha vs    State of Gujarat reported in AIR 1970 SC 1266,    Union of India vs BN Anantha Padma Nabiah    ported in AIR 1971 SC 1836, State of Andhra    Pradesh vs PT Appaiah reported in 147 AIR 198!

      "323. As regards the first ground as to the    scope and jurisdiction of Third learned Judge, Mr    Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned Advocate for the    appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos.56 and 58 of    2007, has submitted that the first learned Judge of    the Division Bench of the High Court Division dis-    carded all the three confessional statements one 0!    which was made by Lieutenant Colonel (Ret¢)    Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) whose confession    was finally decided by the Third learned Judge to be    true and voluntary. But the remaining two confe-    sions were kept undecided for his exclusion from                      the hearing and as such, finality of opinion to follow    the jugement as pet provision of section 429 read    with section 377 of CrPC for the purpose of section    We ‘ not been achieved. In support of his con.    Yi he has referred to the case of Hethubha ys    ee of Gujarat reported in 1970 (1) SCC (Cr) 280,    y ian of India vs Anantha Padma Nabiah reported    Un on] SCC (Cri), Sajjan Singh vs State of MP    ep ated in 1999 SCC (Cri) 44 and Mohim Mondal    marae reported in 15 DLR 615.

The convict appellants being aggrieved    with the judgment and order dated 30-4-2001 passed    by the High Court Division accepting the death ref:    erence and dismissing their respective appeals pre-    ferred separate criminal petitions for leave to appeal    against the judgment and order of the Third learned    Judge of the High Court Division. The Appellate    Division upon analogous hearing of the appeals    passed a common leave granting order on five    grounds, which have been reproduced by my    learned brother Md Tafazzul Islam, J in his judg-    ment.        ",
      "321. In view of the aforesaid split opinions    passed by a Division Bench of the High Court    Division, the cases with their opinions were referred    to the Third learned Judge of the High Court    Division, Mohammad Fazlul Karim, J under sec-    tions 378 and 429 of the Code of Criminal    Procedure (CrPC). The Third learned Judge had    taken up the hearing of the Death Retorency    respect of the aforesaid six accused persons in 1)    matter of whom the learned Judges of the Divisinn    Hone had differed in their opinions Le. those ¢ (sj ;    accused persons who were found guilty by the ee    ond learned Judge but not found guilty by the fir    learned Judge, The Third learned Judge by hig hulp,    ment and order dated 30-4-2001 concurring with the    opinion of the second learned Judge Accepted thy    death reference so far as it relates to Lictitenar,    Colonel Mohinddin Ahmed (Artillery), Captain    Abdul Majed and Resalder Moslemuddin fii    Moslehuddin and dismissed the Criminal Appeal    No.2617 of 1998 filed by the appellant Licttenan,    Colonel (Retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery), Bur    the Third learned Judge concurring with the fir    learned Judge dismissed the death reference jp    respect of following three accused persons, namely,    Captain Md Kismat Hashem, Captain Nazmy|    Hossain Anser and Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain    @ Shariful Islam and their conviction and sentence    were also set aside acquitting them from the charge        levelled against them.        ",
      "320. ABM Khairul Haque, J the second    learned Judge of Division Bench, accepted the death    reference of all 15 (fifteen) accuseds including the    accused-appellants and affirmed the judgment and    order of conviction and sentence in respect of all the    15 (fifieen) accused persons and dismissed the    aforesaid criminal appeals.        ",
      "319. Thereafter, the Hon’ble High Court    Division comprising Md Ruhul Amin, J and ABM    Khairul Haque, J conducted analogous hearing of    the Death Reference No.30 of 1998 and the afore-    said five Criminal Appeals. However, the Division    Bench rendered split opinions in respect of the judg-    ment and order of conviction and sentence awarded    against 15 (fifteen) accuseds including the present    accused-appellants. The first learned Judge of the    High Court Division, Md Ruhul Amin, J accepted    the death reference in part in respect of four convict-    appellants, namely, Lieutenant Colonel Syed    Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Sultan    Shahriar Rashid Khan, Major Md Bazlul Huda and    Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) and five    other convicts, namely, Lieutenant Colonel Abdur    Rashid, Lieutenant Colonel Shariful Hoque Dalim,    Lieutenant Colonel AM Rashed Chowdhury,    Lieutenant Colonel SHMB Nur Chowdhury and    Lieutenant Colonel Md A Aziz Pasha.

But his conviction    and sentence under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal    Code was set aside. The first leamed Judge rejected    the death reference in respect of appellant    Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Arullery) and allowed his appeal being Criminal    Appeal No2617 of 1998 and the judgment and    order of conviction and sentence passed by the    eamed Sessions Judge in respect of him was set    aside and, accordingly, first learned Judge of the    High Court Division set aside the judgment and    order of the learned Sessions Judge in respect of    those five convicts.        ",
      "318. As against the aforesaid judgment and    order of conviction and sentence dated 8-11-1998    passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Dhaka, the    convict-appellants, namely, Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan preferred Criminal    Appeal No.2604 of 1998; Major Md Bazlul Huda    preferred Criminal Appeal No.2613 of 1998;    Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman preferred    Criminal Appeal No.2616 of 1998; Lieutenant    Colonel (Retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) pre-    ferred Criminal Appeal No.2617 of 1998; and Major    (Retd) AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) preferred    Criminal Appeal No.434 of 2007 before the Hon'ble    High Court Division.        ",
      "996. The Investigating Officer (IO), after thorough    investigation, submitted a charge sheet against 20    (twenty) accused persons including the present    appellants under sections 302/120B/324/307/201/    380/149/34/109 of the Penal Code. The learned    Sessions Judge, Dhaka by his Order No.15 dated 7-    4-1997 framed charges against 20 (twenty) accused    Persons under sections 120B, 302, 34 and 201 of the    Penal Code. Accused Jubaida Rashid was dis-    charged by the High Court Division in a Criminal    Revision Case. Accordingly, 19 (nineteen) accused    Persons including the appellants faced the trial,    Sixty-one witnesses were examined in total. No evi-    dence was adduced by the defence. Thereafter, the    trial Court vide his judgment and order dated 8-11-    1998 convicted 15 (fifteen) persons including the    accused-appellants under sections 302/34/120B of    the Penal Code and acquitted 4 (four) of the accused    persons, The said 15 (fifteen) accused persons    including the accused-appellants were sentenced to    death under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.    Notwithstanding the fact that the accused-appel-    lants, along with eleven others, were also convicted    under section 120B of the Penal Code, the learned    Sessions Judge, Dhaka did not impose any separate    sentence thereunder.

      "313. God, the Almighty, likes and loves the    tolerant and crowns with success, A murderer is    always a murderer and a terrorist is always a terror    1st and is enemy to mankind and humanity and an    offender in the eye of law. To protect and shelter    such killers is a great crime, a great sin and sit    Spares none.

The arms of law is yet much more longer    and mighty than the devilish might and misdeeds of    the despotic and treacherous Government. |t is    revealed from the instant case that justice delayed is    not always (justice) denied but is available to the    endurance. We have high respect in the people of    this country who always held high against all odds,    the spirit of democracy and pursued through pain    and hardship to restore and retain democratic rights    and culture through democratic Government. We    believe that the people shall continue their role as    vanguard of democracy to make the Government    accountable,        ",

In the periphery of the instant Case, it j    indeed, difficult for us to address the submission, of    the learned Attorney-General, but we agree that; the    citizens of the Republic have the right to know ho»,    their hard earned money was being spent by the    Government and what was the authority of the    Government to protect, shelter and rehabilitate the    criminals instead of bringing them to face trial.

We are shockingly in dearth of proper    words to deprecate, condemn, disapprove and    denounce such treacherous, immoral and unautho-    rised activities of the beneficiary governments and    their misuse of Government machineries, No    bereaved family should be deprived of their right to    get justice nor should they move with pain, agony    and humiliation seeking justice for decades against    Government obstruction under the blanket of black    law nor any learned Judge should feel embarrass-    ment beyond their code of conduct to dispense jus-    tice being faithful to our oath, out of fear and favour.    Such activities of the Government are highly irre-    sponsible, regrettable, disgraceful and shameful not    only to the nation but also to the civilized commu-    nity of the world and lowered down the image of the    country internationally, We like to hope resolutely    and believe that neither the learned Judges 7    indulge to repeat their tarnishing role nop , i    heinous and nefarious acts at the Government    using Government power, authority and Jeg.)

      "305. On 15th August, 1975 Khondker    Mustaque Ahmed a Minister of Sheikh Mujib    Government, became the President after the killings.    He promulgated Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 on 26-    9-1975, Scenario of the country rapidly changed    thereafter, Martial Law was declared, the convicts    were sent abroad, Khandker Mustaque Ahmed was    temoved, General Ziaur Rahman became Chief of    Amy and later Chief Martial Law Administrator    and became the President of Bangladesh and later    General HM Ershad stepped in as President till he    Was removed in 1990 by people's uprising.

      "304. Evidence and materials on record show    that the. convicts brutally killed the unarmed    President, his wife, brother and three sons with their    wives Without any provocation or resistance for    their personal gain and interest. Mr Mohitul Islam,    pW 1, the then resident PA to the President sustained    bullet injuries in his body and was admitted into    Dhaka Medical College Hospital. He escaped from    the Hospital and went to Lalbagh Police Station to    lodge FIR (First Information Report) over the inci-    dent. But he was driven out by the Police Officer    instead of recording the information of murder.        ",
      "303. The devilish incident of killing occurred    ihe early morning (Fazar Prayer Time) of 15th    in gust 1975 in the Official House of the then    dent Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at    road No. 32, Dhanmondi Residential Area, Dhaka        under the then Lalbagh Police Station, now        Dhanmondi. The convicts brutally killed 11 (eleven)        arson there including the then President as stated    above. The two daughters of the President, Sheikh        Hasina, NOW Prime Minister of Bangladesh, and her    sister Sheikh Rehana luckily escaped death as they    were abroad at that time, but unfortunately, became    orphans overnight.

      "302. Mr Attorney-General strongly urged upon    us to ensure that no learned Chief Justice should bow    and yield to force and pressure and take the post of    Chief Martial Law Administrator or administer oath    any usurper in future, disgracing the Judiciary, We    have heard the leaned Counsel for the respondents.    rei submissions merit consideration.

      "300. Mr Attorney-General added that the then    Government not only harboured those criminals but    also allowed Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Syed    Faruque Rahman to float a political party in the    country named \"Freedom Party\" and a National    Daily named \"The Millat\" and also allowed to con-    test as a Presidential candidate in the general elec-    tion, Major (Retd) Bazlul Huda and Lieutenant    Colonel (Retd) Kh. Abdur Rashid were allowed to    contest in the general election in 1996 and were    elected as Members of the Parliament and kh    Rashid was made leader of the opposition earning    hatred and discord of the people. He submitted that    this was not a murder of an individual but they want    ed to kill the ideals, values and the achievement of    our war of liberation.        ",
      "299. Learned Attorney-General drew ou;    attention to the intensity of the brutality from the    evidence and submitted that when weeping Russel]    wanted to go back to the lap of his mother, woung.    ed Sheikh Naser taking shelter in a bathroom, was    crying for water, Begum Fazilat-un-nessa Mujib    seeing her husband Bangabandhu lying dead in a    pool of blood on the stairs cried out and asked to kil]    her, \"3/1521\" (devils) silenced all of them with    shower of bullets exceeding the cruelty perpetrated    by demon force of devil Yeazid in 'Karbala’.

      "298. Mr Anisul Hug, the leamed Counsel for    the respondent, pointed out in a deep voice that    Prosecution, with a view to get justice and to see    tule of Jaw has been established, unsuccessfully    moved from Court to Court in High Court Division    with heavy pain and agony, with humiliation and    filed m reeling embarrassed for reasons :    amen is them.

",
      "297. Mr Hossain contended that the    Constitution was eclipsed by the acts of the parties,    although Martial Law is no law but a jungle law, our    Supreme Court termed the Martial Law as ‘Supra    Constitutional.’ Hon'ble Chief Justice, a Civilian,    was made Chief Martial Law Administrator, who    later obliged to administer oath to the hi jacker, who    grabbed State power as the President of the    Republic,        ",
      "206. Senior Counsel Mr Ajmalul Hossain,    QC, strongly   voiced that role of Government visa-    vis state 2s cuardian of the people is to protect, safe    guard and uphold the right and liberty of its citizens    and law end order of the country. But after killing of    the President, General Ziaur Rahman hijacked the    constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties of    the citizens, justice delivery system totally failed    and collapsed after proclamation of the Indemnity    Ordinance, 1975 and the aggrieved persons failed to    secure justice by bringing the heinous offenders to    trial. He added that the then Governments took the    role of protector of the criminals instead of dis-    charging the responsibilities of prosecuting them    resulting in colossal and catastrophic failure of dis-    pensation of justice and law and order.        such a gruesome mass kil        ",
      "295. The learned Counsels for the respon-    dents drew our attention from evidence and materi-    als on record that, the convicts from time to time    met and discussed about their conspiracy with Kh.    Mustaque Ahmed, the then Minister, Major General    Ziaur Rahman, the then Deputy Chief of Army, who    after 15th of August, 1975 became Chief of Army,    later Chief Martial Law Administrator and thereafter    usurped power as President of the Republic, his    reaction in the very morning of 15th August, 1975,    hearing about the killing of the President from    Colonel Shafayet Jamil, how a Police Officer of the    local Police Station driven out the PW 1 AFM    Mohitul Islam with filthy language refusing to    record FIR from him apprehending threat on his life    and service, which came true shortly with the pass-    ing of the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 by Khondker    Mustaque Ahmed, who became the President of the                       Republic after the incident, sending the culprits     abroad on 4th November, 1975 by him/Major     General Khaled Mosharaf and inclusion of the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 in the schedule of 5th Amendment of the constitution and rehabilitating them in different foreign missions Bangladesh by president General Ziaul Rahman and subsequently     by the next President General HM Ershad and there after under State patronisations.        protector using the State machineries and public    exchequer to harbour the notorious criminals     providing them shelter and jobs disgracing  our    internationally against common sentiment    nation to bring and put them on trial.        ",
      "294. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned    Attorney-General, termed it as tragic and inhuman    (he burst into tears while placing the evidence on    murder of Sheikh Russell). Mr Ajmalul Hossain,    QC, described it as horrendous killing, Sr Advocate    Mr Tawfique Newaz, Sr Advocate Mr Abdul Matin    Khasru, former Law Minister, Sr Advocate and    President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Mr    AFM Mesbahuddin Ahmed, for the Apex Bar and on    behalf of all the Bars of the country, with tears    rolling on their cheeks, termed the incident as    pathetic, brutal and barbarous referring to and    reminding us the tragic incident of \"Karbala mas-    sacre\" at the hands of devil forces of Yeazid. They    all in unison with choked voice sought justice nar-    rating the events unfolding the evidence and materi-    als on record as to how brutally the convicts perpe-    trated the incident and how the criminals were pro-    tected, sheltered, rewarded and maintained under        State patronisation by the then Governments up to    1996.        ",
      "293. Mr Anisul Huq, the Chief Prosecutor for    the respondent, termed the incident of unprovocated    killing of unarmed men, women and child as    heinous and barbarous unknown to civilisation and    rare in the history of mankind.        ",
      "292. In the instant case, the convicts in the    early morning (Fazar Prayer time) of 15th August,    1975 dastardly murdered the then President of the    Republic, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.,    Father of the Nation and founder of the Republic,    his wife Begum Fazilat-un-nessa Mujib, their 3    (three) sons, Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal and the 9-    10 years old youngest son Sheikh Russell, wives of    Sheikh Kamal and Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Naser    Rahman, the brother of the President along with        other inmates and security officers, in all 11 (eleven)    persons, at the residence of the President at Road    #32, Dhanmondi Residential Area, Dhaka.        ",
      "291. The learned Counsels for the appellants    took us to the facts, evidence and materials on    record of the case including the 3 (three) confes-    sional statements made by convict appellants    Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Syed Faruque Rahman,    Ltd. Colonel (Retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery)        and Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Sultan Shahriar    Rashid Khan.        ",
      "290. Murder of innocent unarmed men and    women and children is the greatest sin in Islam and    also in all other religions and a great crime against    civilisation and mankind. In Islam, death is the only    punishment for murder. Similar punishment has also    been provided in all other religions and under crim-        inal law with exception to transportation for life in    some circumstances.        ",
      "289. Having so agreed with my learned broth-    es, 1 take this opportunity to add, from unfolded    facts and circumstances of the case and from    Counsel's submissions, untold suffering and agony    of two broken-hearted daughters of the murdered    president and the humiliation of long waiting of the    whole nation since 1975 to bring the culprits of the    evilish killing to justice.

      "286. As it appears the principles laid down in    the above decisions are not applicable in the present    applying as the principles of due process of law as    applicable in a common law jurisdiction is not appli-    cable to our legal judicial system since we have    modified laws on the subject and (2) there are uni-    form decisions of our Superior Court that mere    nid is not a legal ground for commutation of a sen-    ence.        owing Pratt’s case and the principles applied in that    se iti    » accepted the petition and commuted the sen- 287, Accordingly I find that the accused per        tence ae - eee    poral death to imprisonment for life observing as SS including the appellants in a planned mannet    committed the heinous crime with their knowledg¢        of the consequences and therefore, they do    deserve any special sympathy in awarding the se™    tence. Therefore, I find no merit in these appeals 2\"        “They therefore reviewed    Or the relevant con-    siderations, at pp. 34-35, and concluded that in                          accordingly, the appeals are dismissed with Modifi    ation as stated earlier.        Md Abdul Aziz J: 1 have pone through and |    willy agree with the judgment delivered by my    jearned brother Mr Md Tafazzul Islam, J, dealing    with the case exhaustively on merit on facts, evi-    gence. law and case laws. 1 also agree with the    opservations made by my leamed brothers, Mr Md    Muzammel Hossain, J and Mr Surendra Kumar    sinha, J.        ",
      "285. In Guerra’ case the Privy Councij fa    lowed the principles taken in Pratt's case observeg        as follows:        “Where a person was sentenced to death in    a common law jurisdiction, execution y,,.    required to be carried out by the state as SWifily    as practicable after sentence, allowing a reason.    able time for appeal and consideration o¢    reprieve, since under the common law a long.    delayed execution was not in accordance y ith    the due process of law. In Trinidad and Tobay,    such an execution, if not stayed, would consi.    tute a cruel and unusual punishment contrary to    section 5(2)(b) of the Constitution and would    not be in accordance with the due process of    law under section 4(a) of the Constitution.” |)    thus appears that the principles laid down in the    above decisions are not applicable in the pres-    ent case, applying the principles of due process    of law as applicable in a common law jurisdic-    tion is not applicable to our legal judicial sys-    tem since we have codified laws on the subject    and (2) there are uniform decisions of our    Superior Court that mere delay is not a legal    ground for commutation of a sentence.

In Henfield’s case the Privy Council, fol-        Avs ST        saves (Md Tec Islan J) 62 DER (AD) (29),    )        n which execution Was to take    ac        a        any case j p    more than five years after sentence there y.,        be strong grounds for believing that the dele,    at execution thereafter would ..?    m.        was such th    an punishment contrary to sec),    n        stitute inhum        171)\".        ",
      "283. In Pratt’s case referred in Mr Mamun it    appears the rules in force in Jamaica laid down a    strict timetable for appeals to the Judicial    Committee of the Privy Council and further provid-    ed that execution would only be stayed so long as    the timetable was adhered to, There were also cer-    tain other pleas that were raised. The Privy Council    accepted their plea and commuted their sentence to    imprisonment for life on the following reasons:        “prolonged delay in carrying out a sentence    of death after that sentence had been passed    could amount to inhuman......... punishment or    other treatment contrary to section 17(1) of the    Jamaican Constitution irrespective of whether    the delay was caused by the shortcomings of the    state or the Jegitimate resort of the accused to    all available appellate procedures. A state that    wished to retain capital punishment had to    accept the responsibility of ensuring that execu-    tion followed as swiftly as practicable after sen-    tence, allowing a reasonable time for appeal    and consideration of reprieve and, if the appel-    late procedure enabled the prisoner to prolong    the appellate hearings over a period of years,    the fault was to be attributed to the appellate    system that permitted such delay and not to the    prisoner who took advantage of it.”                ",
      "282. In Machhi Singh’s case (supra) the    Supreme Court of India, after classifying the cases    in which death penalty may be imposed, calculated    as follows:                      When the victim of murder is (a) an inno-    cent child who could not have or has not pro-    vided even an eXcUse, much less a provocation,    for murder (b) a helpless woman OF a person    rendered helpless by old age or infirmity (c)    when the victim is a person vis-a-vis whom the    r is in a position of domination of trust    (d) when the victim is a public figure generally    loved and respected by the community for the    services rendered by him and the murder 18    committed for political or similar reasons other        than personal reasons.”                ",
      "973. The Supreme Court of India maintained the    conviction of death sentence of Kehar Singh and    Satwant Singh. Ozha J observed as follows:        “Then is the question of sentence which    was argued to some extent. But it must be clear-    ly understood that it is not a case where X is    killed by Y on some personal ground for per-    sonal vendetta. The person killed is a lady and    no less than the Prime Minister of this country    who was the elected leader of the people. In our    country we have adopted and accepted a system    wherein change of the leader is permissible by    ballot and not by bullet. The act of the accused    not only takes away the life of popular leader    but also undermines our system which has been    working so well for the last forty years. There is    yet another serious consideration. Beant Singh    and Satwant Singh are persons who were post-    ed on the security duty of the Prime Minister.    They are posted there is protect her from any    intruder or from any attack from outside and    therefore if they themselves resort to this kind    of offence, there appears to be no reason or no    mitigating circumstance for consideration on    the question of sentence. Additionally, an    unarmed lady was attacked by these two per-    sons with a series of bullets and it has found    that a number of bullets entered her body. The    manner in which mercilessly she was attacked    by these 2 persons on whom the confidence was    reposed to give her protection repels any con-    sideration of reduction of sentence. In this view    of the matter, even the conspirator who inspired    the persons who actually acted does not deserve    any leniency in the matter of sentence. In our    opinion, the sentence awarded by the trial    COURT and maintained by the High Court    appears to be just and proper.”        ",
      "281. In the Indira Gandhi killing case being    Kehar Singh vs State, AIR 1988 SC 1883 similar    question was raised about the extreme sentence of    death in the context of section 354(3) of the Code of    1",
      "280. In the case of Rajiv Gandhi the, ex-Prime    Minister of India, the Supreme Court of India while                      maintaining of death sentence in accordance with    section 354(3) of the Code in the case of Nalini    (1999 3 SCC 253).        DP Wadhwa, J observed as :        “Cruelty of the crime committed has    known no bounds. The crime sent shock waves    in the country. General elections had to be post-    poned. It was submitted more than once that    principal perpetrators in the present case are    already dead but then for the support which    Nalini (A-1), Santhan (A-2), Murugan (A-3) and    Arivu (A-18) afforded for commission of the    crime it could not have been committed. Each    one of these four accused had a role to play.    Crime was committed after previous planning    and executed with extreme brutality. There were    as many as two dry runs as to how to reach Rajiv    Gandhi after penetrating the security cordon. A    former Prime Minister of the country was target-    ed because this country had entered an agree-    ment with a foreign country in exercise of its    sovereign powers. Rajiv Gandhi being the head    of the Government at that time was signatory to    the accord which was also signed by the head of    the Government of Sri Lanka. The Accord had    the approval of Parliament. It was not that Rajiv    Gandhi had entered into the Accord in his per-    sonal capacity or for his own benefit. Though we    have held that object of the conspiracy was not to    commit any terrorist act or any disruptive activi-    ty, nevertheless murder of a former Prime    Minister for what he did in the interest of the    country was an act of exceptional depravity on    the part of the accused, an unparalleled act in the    annals of crimes committed in this country. In a    mindless fashion not only was Rajiv Gandhi    killed but along with him others died and many    suffered grievous and simple injuries. It is not    that intensity of the belt bomb strapped on the    waist of Dhanu was not known to the conspira-        tors as after switching on the first switch on her    belt bomb Dhanu asked Sivarasan to move away.    Haribabu was so keen to have close-up pictures    of the crime that he met his fate in the blast itself.    We are unable to find any mitigating circum-    stance not (sic) to upset the award of sentence of    death on the accused.”            ",
      "279. In Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab, 4     7980 SC &98 Bachan Singh was convicted and Sen.    tenced to death under section 302 for murder o¢    three persons. His sentence of death was confirm, -    by the Punjab High Court. His appeal by Special    Leave came up for hearing before a Division Benchan,    The leave was granted to consider whether the fac;    found by the Courts below would be ‘special rea-    sons’ for awarding the death sentence as requirement    under section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal    Procedure 1973”. The Division Bench of the    Supreme Court referred the matter to 2    Constitutional Bench for a decision in regard to the    constitutional validity of death penalty for murders    provided in section 302 and the sentencing proce-    dure embodied in section 334(3) of the Code. The    Supreme Court by a majority maintained the sen-    tence of death observing as follows:        “Attuned to the legislative policy delineat-    ed in sections 354(3) and 235(2) propositions    (iv)(a) and (v) (b) in Jagmohan, shall have to be    recast and may be stated as below:        (a) The normal rule is that the offences of    murder shall be punished with the sentence of    life imprisonment. The Court can depart from    that rule and impose the sentence of death only    if there are special reasons for doing so. Such    reasons must be recorded in writing before    imposing the death sentence. (b) While consid-    ering the question of sentence to be imposed for    the offence of murder under section 302, Pen!    Code, the Court must have regard to every    evant circumstance relating to the crime as well    as the criminal. If the Court finds, but not oth-    erwise, that the offence is of an exceptionally    depraved and heinous character and constitutes    on account of its design and the manner of its    execution, a source of grave danger to the So    ety at large, the Court may impose the deat    sentence.”        ",
      "278. Under this new provision life sentence is    now the rule and it is only in exceptional cases, for    special reasons to be assigned the death sentence    can be imposed. In the case of Jogmohan Singh vs    State of UP AIR 1973 SC 947 it has been observed    as follows:        “A large number of murders is undoubted-    ly of common type. But some at least are dia-    bolical in conception and cruel in execution. In    some other’s where the victim is a person of    high standing in the country society is liable to    be rocked to its very foundation. Such murders    cannot simply be whisked away by finding ali-    bis in the social maladjustment of the murderer    of such crimes speaks. in Opinion     he inevitability of death panel.        ",
      "973. The correspondent    been reemactec        is provided in section 354(3) which        Section 354(3) When the conviction is for    2 sentence punishable with death or, in the alter-    native, with imprisonment for life or imprison-    ment for 2 term of years, the judgment shall    state the reasons for the sentence awarded, and,    in case of sentence of death, the special reason    for such sentence”.

      "277. As it appears in India section 367(5) has    mite    2 in the Code of 1",
      "276.  The result of this amendment is that it was left to the discretion of the Court on the facts of each to pass a sentence of death or a lesser sentence. The Appellate Division in the case of Abul Khair vs State 44 DLR (AD) 225 held that delay itself is no extenuating circumstances to commute the sentence. The observations are as under:                  \"Delay by itself in the execution of sentence of deatrh is by no means an extenuating circumtances for commuting the sentence of death to imprisonment for life. There must be other circumtances of a compelling nature which together with delay will merit such commutation. We find no compelling extenauting circumtances in this case and therefore, find no ground whatsoever to interfere.”        ",
      "275. This shows that the imposition of death    sentence was the rule and the awarding of a lesser    sentence was an exception-discretion was directed    towards death penalty. This provision was however    substituted by Ordinance No.XLIX of 1978 with    effect from 1979 as follows:        “Section 367(5) provides that “if the    accused is convicted of an offence punishable                              ",
      "274. Originally sub-section (5) of or section    367 provided as follows:    <br>    “If the accused is convicted of an offence    punishable with death, and the Court sentenced    him to any punishment other than death, the    Court shall in its judgment state the reasons    why sentence of death was not passed.”        ",
      "273. In order to satisfy ourselves we have    called for the records of the High Court Division    and perused the order sheet. We noticed that the    appellants never made any endeavour to dispose of    the appeals either in the High Court Division or in    the Appellate Division. It was the State that fre-    quently prayed for fixation of the death reference in    the High Court Division and on its prayer a Bench    Was constituted for hearing the death reference.    After the death reference was disposed of by the    High Court Division, the appellants after filing leave    petitions did not take any step for hearing of their    petitions. It was only on the prayer of the State that    the leave petitions were heard and the appeals were    also heard. Over and above, the appellant Md Bazlul    Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) remained in abscon-    sion in course of the trial of the case and at the time    of hearing of the death reference Mohiuddin    (Lancer), after many years, filed leave petitions with    a prayer for condonation of delay . The delay, in the    premises, was not due to the laches on the part of the    State. Since the condemned prisoners did not take    any steps for hearing of the death reference and their    appeals at any point of time, so they are not entitled    to submit that by reason of their detention in con-    demned cell they have been subjected to “torture or    to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treat-    ment. Further they also did not raise this point at any    point of time, rather from their conduct it is appar-    ent that they have tried to delay the disposal of the        appeal.        ",
      "272. Mr Anisul Hug however contended that    the appellants deserved extreme sentence since they    not only brutally killed the President of the country    who was also Father of the Nation but killed 3    “omen and a child and by their act they committed    “ime against humanity they also extinguished the    pedigree of the First Family in the country and they    did the same act with motive that nobody could take    any legal action in future against them. Accordingly    when the murder is committed in such extremely    wal and grotesque, diabolical, manner and when    Wome, of murder is an innocent child or a helpless    repect whom or a public figure generally loved and    proper ed by the community extreme sentence Is the    4s refs In this connection, the learned Counsel    Minh, tr the case of Machhi Singh vs State of        (1983) 3 Supreme Court Cases 470.            ",
      "271. Learned Attorney-General contends that    tae delay in concluding hearing of the appeal is not    dye to the laches of the State but it is in fact for the    latches of the accused appellants and further the    eccused persons including the appellants in a plan-    ned manner committed the heinous crime with their    knowledge of the consequences and therefore, they    do not deserve any special sympathy in awarding    the sentence.        ",
      "270. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun = the learned    scl, submitted that the appellants have been in    i] for a long time, this prolonged delay in    aving out a sentence of death after their sentence    ; j been passed amounts to inhuman punishment    ; torture and violative of fundamental rights    \" anteed in Article 35(5) of the Constitution, inas-    at 3s under this provision provided that no per-    yall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman    sy parading punishment or treatment and so in    view of the principle laid down in the case of Pratt    s 4norney-General for Jamaica, (1993) 4 All ER    Henfield vs Attorney-General of    Common wealth of Bahamas, 3 WIR (PC) 1079 and    Guerra vs Baptiste (1995) 4 All ER 583, sentence of    jeath awarded to these appellants is liable to be    commuted to imprisonment for life, so sentence of    geath awarded to these appellants is liable to be        commuted to imprisonment for life.                ",
      "269. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned    Counsel, in this contention, referred a decision in                      ",
      "268. Their convictions are modified accord-    ingly. The leaned Counsel of the appellants raising    the point of commuting of sentence submitted that    since the appellants have been in the death cell fora    long period, even this Division finds that the learned    Judges of the High Court Division have rightly    found the charges leveled against them, ends of jus-    tice demands that the sentence awarded to the appellants be reduced to imprisonment for life.        ",
      "267. But however, in view of the discussion    made above, I am of the view that the legal convic-    tion of the appellants Farook Rahman, Mohiuddin    (Artillery), Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) and Bazlul    Huda should have been under section 302 read with    section 120B and section 34 of the Penal Code    instead of 302/34 of the Penal Code and the legal    conviction of Sultan Shahriar should have been    under sections 302/120B of the Penal Code.        ",
      "266. Accordingly, the appellants were duly    convicted under section 120B as well. On overal|    consideration of the evidence and the laws applica.    ble in this case I am of the view that the High Court    Division is justified in arriving at the conclu- sion    that the appellants and other accuseds hatched up    conspiracy to kill the President the members of his    family present in the house, and accomplished their    object by killing them and other three security per-    sonnel.                ",
      "265. Later on in the case of the State of    Andhra Pradesh vs Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao    AIR. 1963 SC 1850 it has been observed:        “The offence of conspiracy is an entirely    independent offence and though other offences    are committed in pursuance of the conspiracy    the liability of the conspirators for the conspi-    racy itself cannot disappear. In the Indian Penal    Code, as originally enacted, conspiracy was not    an offence. Section 120B, which makes crimi-    nal conspiracy punishable, was added by the    Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1913    (VIII of 1913) along with section 120A. Section    120A defines conspiracy and section 120B pro-    vides for the punishment for the offence of con-    spiracy. Criminal conspiracy as defined in sec-    tion 120A consists of an agreement to do an    illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is    not illegal by illegal means, Section 120B pro-    vides that whoever is a party to a conspiracy to    commit an offence punishable with death,    imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment    for a term of two years or upwards shall be pun-    ishable in the same manner as if he has abetted    such offence unless there was an express provi-    sion in the Code for the punish- ment of such    conspiracy. Criminal conspiracy was, however,    not an unknown thing before the amendment of    the Indian Penal Code in 1913 . But what the    amendment did was to make that conspiracy    itself punishable. The idea was to prevent, the    commission of crimes by, so to speak, nippy; e    them in the bud. But it does not follow ,        where crimes have been committed the liabitiy    to punishment already incurred under Section    120B by having entered into a criminal Conspip.    acy is thereby wiped away. No doubt, as alrea d        stated, where offences for committing Which ;    conspiracy was entered into have actually been    committed it may not, in the particular circum,    stances of a case, be desirable to charge the    offender both with the conspiracy and the    offences committed in pursuance of that con.    spiracy. But that would be a matter ultimately    within the discretion of the Court before which        the trial takes place.”        ",
      "264. Inthe case of State of Ahdhra Pradesh vs    Kandimalla Subbaiah AIR 1961 SC 1241 the point    for consideration was whether an offence is said to    have been committed in consequence of abetment,    when it has been committed in pursuance of the con-    spiracy, and the abettor by conspiracy can be made    punishable with the punishment provided for the    actual offence. The Supreme Court replied to the    point as under:    <br>                  “Conspiracy to commit an offence is itself    an offence and a person can be separately    charged within respect to such a conspiracy.    There is no analogy between section 120B and    section 109 IPC There may be an element of    abetment in a conspiracy; but conspiracy is    something more than an abetment. Offences    created by sections 109 and 120B, IPC are quite    distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the    one element of conspiracy,    prosecution to only consation is that        that is, abetment when the allegal    what a person did was something over and    above that. Where a number of offences are    committed by several persons in pursuance ofa    conspiracy it is usual to charge them with those    offences as well as with the offence of conspi-        racy to commit those offence.”        ",
      "263. In the case of Noor Mohammad Mohol    Yusuf Momin (Supra) the distinctive features of sec-        tions 34, 107 and 120B have been explained as fol-    lows:      <br>  “So far as section 34, Indian Penal Code is    concerned, it embodies the principle of joint lia-    bility in the doing of a criminal act, the essence    of that liability being the existence of a com-    mon intention. Participation in the commis-    sion of the offence in furtherance of the com-    mon intention invites its application, Section    109 . Indian Penal Code, on the other hand, may    be attracted even if the abettor is not present    when the offence abetted is committed provid-    ed that he has instigated the commission of the    offence or has engaged with one or more other        Persons in a conspiracy to commit an offence            and pursuant to that conspiracy some act or    illegal omission takes place or has intentionally    aided the commission of an offence by an act or    illegal omission. Turning to the charge under    section 120B. Indian Penal Code, criminal con-    spiracy was made a substantive offence in 1913    by the introduction of chapter V-A in the Indian    Penal Code. Criminal conspiracy postu- lates an    agreement between two or more per- sons to do,    or cause to be done, an illegal act or an act    which is not illegal, by illegal means. It differs    from other offences in that mere agreement ts    made an offence even if no step is taken to carry    out that agreement. Though there is close asso-    ciation of conspiracy with incite- ment and    abetment the substantive offence of criminal    conspiracy is somewhat wider in am- plitude    than abetment by conspiracy as contem- plated    its very nature is generally hatched in secret. It    is, therefore, extremely rare that direct evidence    in proof of conspiracy can be forth- coming    from wholly disinterested quarters or from utter    strangers. But, like other offences, criminal    conspiracy can be proved by circum- stantial    evidence. In- deed, in most cases proof of con-    spiracy is largely inferential though the infer-    ence must be founded on solid facts. Sur-    rounding circumstances and antecedent and    subsequent conduct, among other factors, cons-    titute relevant material. In fact, because of the    difficulties in having direct evidence of crimi-    nal conspiracy, once reasonable ground is    shown for believing that two or more persons    have conspired to commit an offence then any-    thing, done by anyone of them in reference to    their common intention after the same is enter-    tained becomes, according to the law of evi-    dence, relevant for proving both conspiracy and    the offences ‘committed pursuant thereto. ”        ",
      "262. Sub-section (1) of section 120B imposes    a penalty equal to the punishment for abetment on    articipation in criminal conspiracy to commit an    offence: The section appears to have been intro-    guced 10 fill up the gap in section 107 defining    gbetment. Under section 107 “secondly” provides    that a person abets the doing of a thing who engages    with others in a conspiracy for doing of that thing if    an act OT illegal omission takes place in pursuance of    that conspiracy. Abetment of an offence is punish-    able under sections 109 and 116 as the case may be,    if the offence is not committed; but it is clear that a    conspiracy will not amount to an abet- ment unless    anact or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of    the conspiracy. Therefore, the first class of cases    which section 120B is designed to cover, is that in    which the conspiracy is formed for the commission to    a serious offence. But no act or illegal omission has    taken place in present appeals. Section 120A provides    the extended definition of criminal conspiracy cover-    ing acts which do not amount to abetment by con-    spiracy within the meaning of section 107; Section    120B provides punishment for criminal conspiracy    where no express provision is made in the Penal Code    for the punishment of such conspiracy.        ",
      "261. As it appears that there is no substantial    difference between conspiracy as defined in section    120A and acting on a common intention as conte”    plated in section 34 . In the former the gist for the    offence is bare agreement and association to break    law even though illegal act does not follow while    the gist of an offence under.section 34 is the commision                      mission of a criminal act in furtherance of a com-    mon intention of all the offenders which means that    there should be a unity of criminal behaviour result-    ‘ag in something for which an individual will be    punishable if it is done by himself alone,        ",
      "259. In Hazrat Ali's case, the Appellate Divi-    sion on assessment of the evidence on record came    to the conclusion that Hazrat Ali abetted the offence    of murder of Zahura Khatun and accordingly con-    verted his conviction to 302/109 from an offence of    302/34,        260, In Dharam Pal’s case, it was observed    that the existence or otherwise of the common inten-    tion depends upon the facts and circumstances of    each case, and in the absence of materials, “the com-    panion or companions cannot justifiably be held    guilty for every offence committed by the principal    offender.” The facts of the above cases are quite dis-    tinguishable from the present case.        ",
      "258. Regarding the submission that conviction     of the charge of conspiracy could not be Liven    after the conspiracy has borne fruit, as it appears in    Shamsul Hoque’ case, following the case reportey    in AIR 1938 Mad 130 which was also followed in 4    DLR 48, it was observed that where an offence is    alleged to have been committed by two or more per.    sons, the person responsible for commission of the    offence should be charged with the substantive    offence, while the persons alleged to have abetted it    by conspiracy should be charged with the offence of    abetment under section 109 . As it appears views    taken in AJR 1938 Mad 130 which was follows in g    DLR 48 have been overruled in Kandimally    Subbaiah's case (AIR 1961 SC 1241 (paras 7 and 8),    The facts and the principles of law involved in Amar    Kumar Thakur s case are quite distinguishable since    the offence charged against the accused is under sec-    tions 302/34, in which, this Court found no legal    evidence that the “appellants No.2-4 had any inten-    tion of their own to cause the death of Nandalal, par-    ticularly when he was proceeding at their request to    hold the mediation at that hour of the night.”        ",
      "257. The above decision discussed the prin-    ciples of joint liability, mere distance from the scene    of crime cannot exclude culpability under section 34    of the Penal Code in criminal sharing making out a    certain measure of jointness in the commission of    the act. However the learned Judges of the High    Court Division failed to appreciate the ratio deci-    dendi of the above decisions regarding the presence    of appellant, Sultan Shahriar, | am accord- ingly of    the view that the prosecution is required to prove the    Presence of Sultan Shahriar and his Parti- cipation in    the commission of the offence in fur- therance of the    common intention of all in order to bring his offence    within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal Code buy    failed,        ",
      "256. And this is the role of accused No.2 according to the Courts below. Could this legal interface be altogether untenable?        ",
      "255. The application of section 34 in respect    of the offences other than physical violence have    been explained in Tukaram Ganpats case (supra)    wherein the facts against the accused including the    appellant Tukaram were that they stole some bun-    dles of copper wire from the godown of a company    after breaking open the godown and removed them    by a lorry which stopped at a weigh-bridge Where    the brokers for sale were present, There was no evi-    dence about the presence of the appellant at the    scene of offence. The concurrent findings of the    Courts below were that the appellant was in posses-    sion of duplicate keys of the burgled godown found    missing from the factory and that he was present at    the weigh bridge. The appellant had no explanation    for possessing of godown keys nor for his presence    at weigh-bridge. In the context of the matter me    Supreme Court maintained the conviction of the                      appellant on applying the principles of common    intention as under:    “Mere distance from the scene of crime    cannot exclude culpability under section 34    which laws down the rule of joint responsibility    for a criminal act performed by a plurality of    persons. In Barendra Kumar Ghosh vs King    Emperor (1924) 52 JA 40-(AIR 1925 PC 1) the    Judicial Committee drew into the criminal net    thase ‘who only stand and wait.’. This does not    mean that some form of presence, near or    remote, is not necessary, or that mere presence    without more, at the spot of crime, spells culpa-    bility . Criminal sharing, overt or covert, by    active presence or by distant direction, making    out a certain measure of jointness in the com-    mission of the act is the essence of section 34.    Even assuming that presence at the scene is a    pre-requisite to attract section 34 and that such    propinguity is absent. section 107 which is dif-    ferent in one sense, still comes into play to rope    in the accused. The act here is not the picking    the godown Jock but housebreaking and crimi-    nal house trespass. This crime is partici- pated    in by those operating by remote control as by    those doing physical removal.. Together operat-    ing in concert, the criminal project is executed.    Those who supply the duplicate key, wait at the    weigh bridge for the break-in and bringing of    the booty and later secrete the keys are par-    ticipes criminil,        ",
      "254. In the case of Noor Mohammad Md    Yusuf Momin vs State of Maharashtra (supra), the    trial Court convicted Md Taki Haji Hussain Momin    under section 302 and acquitted three other accused    including the appellant. On appeal against acquittal,    the Bombay High Court reversed the acquittal and    convicted the appellant and two others under sec-    tions 120B and 302 read with section 34, IPC. The    appellant was also convicted under sections    302/109, IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life    on two counts separately. The appellant’s conviction    under sections 302/34, IPC was set aside on the fol-    lowing observations:        “From the evidence it seems highly prob-    able that at the time of the actual murder of    Mohd. Yahiya the appellant was either present    with other three co-accused or was somewhere    nearby. But this evidence does not seem to be    enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt his    presence at the spot in the company of the other    accused when the murder was actually commit-    ted ..... we are, therefore, inclined to give to the    appellant the benefit of doubt in regard to the    charge under section 302 read with section 34,    IPC.”        ",
      "253. In Tajul Islam’s case (supra) the High    Court Division noticed the evidence produced by    the prosecution in support of charge that Badsha in    his confession stated that he pressed the legs of sec:    ond son of Biroja Rani, and accused Inu cut him into    two pieces by a dao. Other confessing accused stat-    ed that for the purpose of committing the offence    they went to the house of Biroja and were on guard    either in the boat or in front of the door of neigh-    bours of Biroja or on the road leading to the house    of Biroja presumably to prevent any person from    coming in the way of their committing the offence.    In the facts of the case the learned Judges observed    as follows:        “In offence involving physical viol    normally presence at the scene of the 0    tence of the offender sought to be rend    liable on the principle of joint liability ness-    sary; such is not the case in respect of other    offences where offence consists of adverse acts    Which may be done at a different time and    place.”        ",
      "252. In the case of Rasool Bux vs State 22    pLR (SC) 297 the Supreme Court of Pakistan    roved the views taken in the case of Barendra    St Ghosh and considered the case in the light of    observations made by their Lordships of the    a Council. In that case accused Lal Bux and    asul Bux planned to abduct Mst. Roshna from the    pouse of her father, if necessary, by the use of force.    They were both armed with deadly weapons. When    their presence was discovered in the Courtyard they    gbandoned their original plan but were nevertheless    getermined to escape, if necessary, by use of    weapons carried by them. It was observed this    “common intention though originally not present    wes formed at the spur of the moment when they    found themselves being surrounded by persons    attracted to the place.......... ”. Lal Bux fired at the    person Who was ahead of those coming to prevent    their escape and Rasul Bux also fired two shots . It    was further observed that they “fired with the com-    mon intention of preventing the interceptors from    cutting of their escape. It is difficult, therefore, to    appreciate how it can be said that they were not act-    ing in furtherance of the common intention of them    both.”        ",
      "251. In the case of Sreekantiah (supra) it was    observed :        “The essence of section 34 that the person    must be physically present at the scene of occur-    rence coupled with actual participation which,    of course, can be of a passive character such as    standing by a door, provided that is done with    the intention of assisting in furtherance of com-    mon intention of them all and there is a readi-    ness to play his part in the prearranged plan    when the time comes for him to act”. A five-    member Bench of this Court also took similar    view in Abdur Rahman Mondal’s case (supra)    as follows :        “The common intention to bring about a    particular result may well develop on the spot    as between a number of persons. All that is    necessary is either to have direct proof of prior co”    cert or proof of circumstances which necessarily    ily lead to that inference or the incriminating    acts must be incompatible with the innocence .    the accused and incapable of explanation on                      any other reasonable hypothesis. Further, it is    the essence of section 34 that the person must    be physically present at the actual commission    of the crime.”        ",
      "250. In the case of Ramaswami (supra) it has    been observed, section 34 is to be read along with    the preceding section 33 which makes it clear that    the “act” spoken of in section 34 includes a series of    acts as a single act. It follows that the words “when    a criminal act is done by several persons”. So sec-    tion 34, may be construed to mean “when criminal    acts are done by several persons.” The acts com,    mitted by different confederates in the Criminal    action may be different but all must in one way o,    the other participate and engage in the criminal    enterprise. For instance, one may only stand guard    to prevent any person coming to the relief of the Vic-    tim or to otherwise facilitate the execution of the    common design. Such a person also commits ap    “act” as much as his co-participants actually commit.    ting the planned crime. In the case of an offence    involving physical violence, however, it is essential    for the application of section 34 that the person who    instigates or aids the commission of the crime must,    be physically present at the actual commission of    the crime for the purpose of facilitating or prompt.    ting the offence, the commission of which is the aim    of the joint criminal venture. Such presence of those    who in one way or the other facilitate the execution    of the common design, is itself tantamount to actual    participation in the ‘criminal act.’ The essence of    section 34 is simultaneous consensus of the minds    of persons participating in the criminal action to    bring about a particular result. Such consensus can    also be developed at the spot and thereby intended    by all of them.        ",
      "249. Therefore, the dominant feature of sec-    tion 34 is the element of participation in action, this    participation need not be in all cases by physical    presence. The Supreme Court of India has distin-    guished the cases in which the physical presence of    the accused person at the place of incident is pre-    requisite and in which cases the physical presence of    the accused was not necessary-his participation by    doing separate acts similar or diverse would bring    him within the ambit of the section .        ",
      "248. In Barendra, Kumar Ghosh 5.,.case,    (supra) their Lordships of the Privy Council have    clearly expounded the principles animated in the.    section. In that case three men fired at the post mas-    ter, of whom Barendra Kumar, the appellant, was    one. He wore distinctive clothes by which he could    be and was identified; and while these men were just    inside the room, another was visible from the room    through the door standing close to the others but just    outside on the doorstep in the Court- yard. This man    was armed but did not fire. The defence of Barendra    was that he was the man outside the room, that he    stood in the Courtyard and was very much fright-    ened, Whether he was present as one of the firing    party or as its commander or as its reserve or its sen-    tinel was of no special importance on the case made    for the Crown. Why he was there at all and why he    did not take himself off again he did not say, nor did                      he even indicate his precise position in the yard,    Their Lordships while maintaining the conviction of    Barendra expounded the ambit of section 34 as fol-    lows :        “Ry section 33 a criminal act in section 34    includes a series of acts and, further “act    includes omission to act, for example, an omis-    sion to interfere in order to prevent a murder    being done before one’s very eyes. By section    37, when any offence is committed by means of    several acts Whoever intentionally cooperates in    the commission of that offence by doing any    one of those acts, either singly or jointly with    any other person, commits that offence. Even if    the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the    door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in    other things “they also serve who only stand    and wait.” By section 38 when several persons    are engaged or concerned in the commission of    a criminal act, they may be guilty of different    offences by means of that act. Read together,    these sections are reasonably plain. Section 34    deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or    diverse by several persons; if all are done in fur-    therance of a common intention, each person is    liable for the result of them all, as ifhe had done    them himself for “that act” and “the act” in the    latter part of the section must include the whole    action covered by “a criminal act” in the first    part, because they refer to it.”        ",
      "247. As observed earlier, the dominant feature    of section 34 of the Penal Code is the element of    participation is actions. This participation need not    in all cases be by physical presence. Common inten-    tion implies acting in concert. This section requires    that there must be a general intention shared by all    the persons united with a common pur- pose to do    any criminal offence, all of those who assist in the    accomplishment of the object would be equally    guilty. It follows, therefore, that common intention    is an intention to commit a crime actually commit-    ted and every one of the accused should have par-    ticipated in that infention.        ",
      "246. Regarding Sultan Shahriar, admittedly    he was not present at the place of occurrence and he    was deployed at the Radio Station from before the    time of occurrence. As stated earlier, his task was    also to prevent anyone from seeking help through    the Radio Station. So question arises whether his act    falls within the ambit of section 34 since he was not    physically present at the place of occurrence? The    leamed Judges of the High Court Division were of    the view that he shared the common intention with    other accused persons, although his participation    Was Not active, it was passive, which act also fell    Within the ambit of section 34 . The first learned    Tudge observed that besides being present at the    night parade, his presence at the Radio Station was    part of the said agreement that he entered into agree-    ment with other convicts for the purpose of causing    the incident in the house of the President. The sec-    ond learned Judge also noticed his presence at the    Radio Station about 4-30/5-00 AM and expressed    similar views. The learned Judges considered the    cases of Barendra Kumar Ghose vs Emperor, AIR    1925 (PC) 1, Shreekantiah Ramayya Muni Palli, vs    State of Bombay AIR 1955 SC 287, Tukaram    Gonapat vs State of Maharashtra AIR 1974 SC 5] 4,    Ramaswami vs State of TN AIR 1976 SC 2027,    Abdur Rahman Mandol vs State, 29 DLR (SC) 247,    Bangladesh vs Abed Ali, 36 DLR (AD) 234, Abdus    Samad vs State 44 DLR (AD) 233 and State vs Tajul    Islam 48 DLR 305 in coming to their conclusion.        ",
      "245. The records show that Mohiuddin (Artillery    ) was deputed with cannon at Kalabagan play-    ler? nd near Road No, 32, Sultan Shahriar was    gt\" ad at the Radio Station, Farook Rahman came    7 ; Rakhibahini Headquarter to the house of the    In gent, Mohiuddin (Lancer), Bazlul Huda and    hie other officers were given the main task of    ementing the main object of killing the Presi-    t and the members of his family, The movement    den appellants with arms and cannons at different    of the sints was a part of the criminal conspiracy to    vit Pe common design of killing the President    his family members Without any interruption.    qzlur Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) actively par-    jpated in the killing. Farook Rahman as it appears    though did not join in the Killing but his presence    near the house of the President with a tank at the    ‘me of killing was in furtherance of common inten-    tion of all of them to implement the act and with that    end in view to resist others to come in the way of    implementing their ultimate goal and though his    participation was passive and diverse but he was    resent at or about the place of occurrence. Mohi-    yddin (Artillery) aided co-accuseds Bazlul Huda,    Mohiuddin (Lancer) and others by way of guarding    the house of the President with his troops and can-    non from Kalabagan playground with the motive    that if force come forward to rescue the President he    would resist them, and with that object he fired four    cannon balls letting others to know that he was pre-    pared to use the cannon-balls. Thus, actions of    Faruque Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) come    within the ambit of section 34 as they were ready to    participate in the crime in case of necessity.            ",
      "244. As stated earlier, the appellants attended    the night parade, and it was organised to fulfil and    implement their object. The appellants and other    accuseds deployed jawans under the command of    officers at key points such as, Rakhibahini Head-    quarter, BDR Headquarter, Radio Station, Minto    Road. and Road No. 32 .This deployment of army at    Rakhibahini Headquarter and BDR Headquarter    was a part of their pre-plan to prevent these para-    military forces to come forward to protect the    President in case of any information or help was    sought for, The deployment at the Radio Station was    for preventing any person on behalf of the Gover    ment to seek any help from the army, navy, air force.    paramilitary forces, political activists or from other    sources. The deployment at Minto Road was also !0    prevent the Ministers to mobilise the public or any    other force for the protection of the President.                      ",
      "243. Now the question is, what will be result    if the above principles are applied to the facts of the    present appeals?        ",
      "242. A criminal intention within the Meaning    of section 34 is simultaneous conscientiousness of    minds of persons participating in the criminal action    to bring such particular result and if one facilitates    the execution of the common design such Person    commits an act as much as his CO-participants    actually committing the planned crime. The essence    of section is that the person must be Physically    present at the actual commission of the crime. This    must be coupled with actual participation, which    may be of passive character such as standing by a    door or near about the incident with the intention of    assisting in furtherance of common intention of all    the accused and with a readiness to play his pant    when the time comes for him to act.        ",
      "241.         Following illustrations will clear the    point :      <br>      A attacks Z under such circumstances, 5    grave provocation that his killing of Z Would    only culpable homicidal not amounting to mu.    der. B having ill-will towards Z and intendint    to kill him, and not having been subject to the    provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though    A and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death    B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of    culpable homicide.        ",
      "240. A reading of these provision shows that    sections 34 and 35 create responsibility for the total    result while section 38 creates individual responsi-    bility only. Section 34 applies where there is a com-    mon intention and for a criminal act done in further-    ance of common intention of all, everyone is equally    responsible. Section 35 requires the existence of the    knowledge or intent in each accused before he can    be held liable if knowledge or intent is necessary to    make the act criminal, Thus, if two persons beat a    Third and one intent to cause his death and the other    to cause only grievous injury and there is no com-    mon intention, their offences will be different. This    would not be the case if the offence is committed    with a common intention or each accused possesses    the necessary intention or knowledge. Section 38        provides for different degrees of responsibility    arising from the same kind of act.        ",
      "239. To meet the points of common intention    and the responsibility arising therefrom, the true    purports of sections 34, 35 and 38, which read as    follows, are to be examined.    <br>    “34 . When a criminal act is done by several    persons, in furtherance of the common intention    ofall, each of such persons is liable for that act in    the same manner as if it were done by him alone.    <br>    35 . Whenever an act, which is criminal only    by reason of its being done with a criminal    knowledge or intention, is done by several    persons, each of such persons who joins in the    act with such knowledge or intention is liable for    the act in the same manner as if the act were done    by him alone with that knowledge or intention.    <br>    38 . Where several persons are engaged or    concemed in the commission of a criminal act,    they may be guilty of different offences by    means of that act.”        ",
      "238. Mr Anisul Huq and the Advocate-Gene-    ral, on the other hand, submitted that even if it is    assumed that section 34 is not applicable in respect    of Sultan Shahriar this would however be of little    practical benefit to him because his participation in    the criminal conspiracy to implement the object has                          been established by the prosecution. It was further    contended by Mr Huq that section 120A being an    independent offence, order of conviction and sen-    tence may be passed in respect of Sultan Shahriar    under section 120B of the Penal Code.        ",
      "237. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, submitted that    Farook Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) were not    found present in House No.677 at Road No.32 and    that there is also no nexus between the deployment    of artillery troops at Kalabagan play ground by    Mohiuddin (Artillery) and the killing of President    and the members of his family and therefore both of    them have been illegally convicted under sections    302/34 of the Penal Code and further if the offence    committed is found to be a mutiny which being a    military offence, the provisions of sections 34 or    section 38 of the Penal Code as regard common    intention and the responsibility arising therefrom,    will have no manner of application in the present        appeals.        ",
      "236. Mr Khan further submitted that con-    viction in the charge of conspiracy could not be    given after the conspiracy has borne its fruits.        ",
      "235. Md Abdur Razaque Khan, submitted that    Sultan Shahriar was not present at or about the place    of occurrence and in the absence of any overt act or    his participation in the incident of killing with the    other accused persons, his conviction under sections    302/34 is totally illegal and in order to bring Sultan    Shahriar within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal    Code some overt act or acts on his part relating to    the incident must be established to lead to the infer-    ence that he has participated with the participators in    the crime in preconcerted or pre-arranged plan and    except the evidence of PW 14 that he saw him at the    parade ground at Balurghat, there is no other corro-    borating evidence on record that he was in any way    Involved in the alleged occurrence and further the    presence of Sultan Shahriar at the Radio Station at    or around 6-00 AM on 15th August after the    occurrence was part of his official duty, for which,    he cannot be saddled with the charge of murder. Mr    Razaque Khan further submitted that since Sultan    Shahriar was not present at House No.677 of Road    No.32 and has not actively participated in the    murder his act cannot justifiably be held guilty for    the offence committed by other principal offenders    and his act at best attracts an offence of abetment of    murder punishable under section 109 of the Penal    Code as held in the cases of Md Shamsul Hoque vs    State 20 DLR 540, Amor Kumar Thakur vs State 40    DLR (AD) 147, Hazrat Ali vs State 44 DLR (AD) 51    and Dharan Pal vs State of Haryana 1978) 4 SCC    440.        ",
      "234. Further, earlier, the question of consi-    dering such issues of fact in these appeals under    Article 103(3) of the Constitution has already been    discussed. Regarding the charge made against    nan Shahriar under sections 302/34 of the Penal    Code.        ",
      "233. Accordingly what Mr Mamun argued    inpointing on certain portions of the evidence of    he Witnesses regarding the presence of Major    pazlul Huda at the place of occurrence and his    identification by the witnesses which are minor in    nature not to speak of even discrepant statement.    The leaned Counsel failed to point out any contra-    dictory statements of any witness, rather he avoided    our query as to whether the incriminating statements    made by the witnesses about the complicity of    Bazlul Huda had been challenged in course of cross-    examination.        ",
      "232. Further in the case of Moyezuddin [31    DLR (AD) 37] it has been observed as follows:      <br>  “We like to observe that the contradiction        in the statement of a witness, either with his    own statement.                          witnwss is a task of appreciation of the evidence    and therefore, it is within the jurisdiction    of the trial Court and the Court of appeal on    fact, to deal with the question. No doubt there is    certain Tule of prudence governing the case of    contradicting statements. It is first to be seen    whether the alleged statement is a discrepant    statement or contradictory statement. The    discrepant statement  one Which is either irrele-    vant oF incoherent, but it is not irreconcilable, A    giscrepant statement is not fatal to the eredibi-    lity of a witness, A contradictory statement is    one which is conflicting and is not reconcilable    with other statements either of his own or any    other witness. The question in such case is, that    it is open to a Court of fact either to reject the    whole evidence of a witness as untrustworthy or    to reject the contradictory part as unreliable or    to rely upon that portion, which in the opinion    of the Court, fits in with other evidence and the    facts and circumstances of the case.”            ",
      "231. The above statement of law is not    disputed being the established principle of law in the    administration of criminal justice. But in the present    appeals the defence version put forwarded by the    appellants does not affect the prosecution case,    rather supports the prosecution case.        ",
      "230. In the case of Safdar Ali vs Crown [5    DLR (FC) 107(64)] referred by the appellants it has    been observed that in a criminal case, it is the duty    of the Court to review the entire evidence that has    been produced by the prosecution and the defence    and if, after examination of the whole evidence, the    Court is of the opinion that there is a reasonable    possibility that the defence put forward by the    accused must be true and it is clear that such a view    reacts on the whole prosecution, in such circum-    stances, the accused is entitled to get benefit of    doubt, not as a matter of grace, but as of right,    because the prosecution has not proved its case    beyond reasonable doubt.        ",
      "229. The leamed Counsel for the appellants        also referred in the case of Muslimuddin [38 DLR    (AD) 311] wherein the appellants were convicted for    the charge of murder relying upon the evidence of    the deceased wife Majeda (PW 1) which is corrobo-    rated by PW 3 another eye-witness but she was    examined by the police Jong after the occurrence.    The High Court Division maintained his conviction.    The Appellate Division on consideration of the    evidence of PW J, the wife of the deceased, found    that she was present in the hut at the time of occur-    rence but she was not corroborated by other wit-    nesses, and it was totally improbable on her part to    recognise so many accused persons with detailed    description. In that case this Division observed;        “In a criminal trial determination of a    disputed fact is the main task before the Court    and Such determination js dependent upon    consideration of answers given by prosecution    witnesses in their cross-examination, Cross-    examination is therefore, indispensably neces-    sary to bring out desirable facts of a case modi-    fying the examination in-chief or establishing    the cross-examiner’s Own case. The object of    cross-examination is two-fold, to bring out the    case of the party Cross-examining and {    Impeach the credibility of the Witness I,    examination in-chief the witness discloses on,  those facts which are favourable to the Party    examining him and does not disclose the    necessary facts which go in favour of the other    side. Cross-examination in a criminal case aims    at extraction of the facts which support the    defence version which is very often sought to    be supported by the prosecution. The opponents    can of course establish facts favourable to them    by calling their own witnesses, but “there js    some thing dramatic in proving one’s own case    from the mouth of the witnesses of the    opponent.” As observed earlier, in the present    appeals, the defence did not challenge the    incriminating part of the material evidence    adduced by the witnesses and therefore, their    evidence remained uncontroverted. The    defence failed to establisl: facts favourable to    them by cross-examining tlie witnesses. There-    fore, this decision instead of helping the    defence helps the prosecution case.        ",
      "228. In the case of Hazrat Ali (54 DLR 636),    also referred by Counsels of the appellant, it has    been observed that when the evidence of witnesses    is dishelieved by the Court in respect of a major part    of the prosecution case regarding the involvement of    the accused persons the testimony of those witnes-    ses cannot be accepted without independent corro-    boration from other sources. The observations made    by the High Court Division in that case is not    disputed. In the present appeals the learned Counsel    failed to point out any major contradiction in the    evidence of the witnesses so as to disbelieve them in    respect of the majority part of the prosecution case.            ",
      "227. Now the question is, whether a finding    as to whether a witness is reliable or independent as    arrived at by the trial Court and the High Court Divi-    sion is a finding of fact and this finding is binding    on this Court and must be accepted as final? The    case of Nurul Islam [43 DLR (AD) 6) referred by the    Counsels of the appellant, leave was granted to    consider the glaring inconsistency and discrepancy    in the evidence of four eye-witnesses, PWs 1, 3, 7    and 8 which cast a doubt as to the truth of the prose-    cution case. The Appellate Division on assessing                      their evidence found it difficult to rely upon them    and observed that the learned Judges of the High    Court Division did not consider the material discre-    pancy of these eye-witnesses while maintaining the    conviction and sentence. Therefore, this decision    referred by the learned Counsel is not applicable in    this case.        ",
      "45. The first leamed Judge failed to consider the    admitted fact that the appellants along with others    hatched up conspiracy at the parade ground, took    ammunition from the kote, removed heavy artillery    from the cantonment, deployed the troops with    artillery at key points and thereafter they killed the    President and other members of his family as    discussed earlier.        ",
      "226. It may also be mentioned here that all the    above prosecution witnesses are army personnel of    Lancer and Artillery units and the appellants and    other co-accused served in those units. The defence    failed to show any enmity with them or their motive    to depose against them in support of the prosecution    case. The defence also failed to shake their testi-    Monies in any manner rather, they virtually admitted    their participation in the incident of murder by not    challenging the testimonies of those witnesses    relating to material particulars. All of them are    neutral and trustworthy witnesses. There is no    Cogent ground to discard their testimonies. The    second and the Third learned Judges of the High    Court Division and as well as learned Sessions    Judge have believed them as independent and reli-    able witness. The first learned Judge also believed    PWs 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 25, while    believing the complicity of Bazlul Huda, Mohi-    uddin’s (Lancer), Farook Rahman and Sultan    Shahriar but disbelieved PWs 16, 17, 18, 21, 22 . 24.    25, 26, 27, 32, and 35 while disbelieving about    Mohiuddin (Artillery) complicity in the occurrence.    The finding of the first learned Judge that “the    presence of the convict with CO at parade was part    of duty and that parade in the night of 14th August    was held as per preexisting practice as seen from the    evidence of PWs 44 and 45 are based upon piece-    meal consideration of the evidence of PWs 44 and    ",
      "225. As regards the appellant Mohiuddin    (Antillery) PWs 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32, 34    end 35 proved as regards his presence at the night    parade wherefrom the troops of his unit marched to    Kelabagan Lake Circus playground, and set up    cennon aiming at Bangabandhu’s house and the    Rekshibahini Headquarter. The witnesses proved    that 2s per his order, his troops fired 4 rounds of    cemon-ball from Kalabagan play ground aiming at    the house of the President and Rakshibahini    Headquarter. This appellant did not deny the state-    ment of this witness. In view of this evidence on    record it cannot be said that there is no sufficient    materials on record to implicate this appellant in the    occurrence of 15th August, 1975 . No exception    could be inferred from this act of participation in the    night parade and the first learned J udge also did not    take any exception even after he was recognised at    Kalabagan play ground with cannons and firing    cannon-balls aiming at the house of the President    and Rakshibahini Headquarter at the time of occur-    rence. In the premises there is no doubt that this    appellant was involved in the occurrence and helped    the other co-accused to commit the carnage. The    second and the Third learned Judges are perfectly    Justified in finding his complicity in the occurrence.            ",
      "224. As regards Mohiuddin (Lancer), it is    seen that PWs 4 and S saw him while he was enter.    OO ab the house of the President by fiting. PW 4    ve stated that he saw while this appellant Was    fart! ° Rangabandhu down the stairs Bazlul Huda    ee Noor shot him dead. Besides these two    and acces, PW 11 saw him at the gate of the house    onl President at or about the time of occurrence    pW 12 saw him while he was getting down from    $0 rack at the entry point of Road No.32 just    pe F the occurrence. Besides these Witnesses, PWs    5 wl 22 saw him while they were dropped at the    2 ing point of road No.32 . Therefore, I find that    7 iearned Judge of the High Court Division have    x gly found his complicity in the incident of 15th    poust, 1975 . In respect of the charge appellant Sul-    nh ;ahriar PW 14 proved his presence at the night     on 14th August at Balurghat and his compli-    wav in the occurrence have been stated while discus-    sing the evidence of PW 14.            ",
      "223. In respect of the charge of murder    levelled against appellant Farook Rahman, PWs I!    and 12 recognised him at the night parade where-    from he along with his force marched towards    Dhanmondi and thereafter he was seen at the gate of    Bangabandhu’s house at or about the time of    occurrence with a tank and talked with Bazlul Huda,    Mohiuddin (Lancer), Major Noor and others, then    when he was confirmed about the death of the    President and other members of his family, left the    place of occurrence. The evidence of these witnes-    ses sufficiently proved that this appellant was also    involved in the occurrence and the learned Judges of    the High Court Division are perfectly justified in    finding his complicity in the murder.                       ",
      "221. PW 35 corroborated PW 34 and    that he was Subedar Major of the Papa Bang    Two Field Artillery of which the appettany 4\"    commander and he narrated the night trainj, the    14th August in detail and stated that Captain Jat On    gir handed over the parade to the appellant an.    further stated that after the incident he queried ik le    force about the cause for killing of the President.    came to know that this appellant and other acer    persons were involved in the killing Of the Presia.    and his family members. The appellant did ent    challenge the statement of this witness, not        222, Onan analysis of the evidence on    it is seen that there are uncontroverted evid    record against the appellant Bazlul Huda about hic    participation in the killing of Sheikh Kamal and    Bangabandhu on 15th August.

PW 4, an    army jawan, posted in the field artillery regiment    and during the relevant time deputed at the house of    the President along with other army personnel of his    company, stated that Bazlul Huda and 3 other army    personnel were from the field artillery units, on [Sth    August, 1975 at about 5-00 AM he along with other    guards noticed that Subedar Major Abdul Wahab    Joarder was getting down from the jeep in front of    the house situated on Road No.3! where he along    with other guards were staying using it as temporary    barrack for guarding the house of the President:    thereafier he along with other guards started towards    the house of the President and afer reaching there    they hoisted flag upon playing bugle and at that time    he noticed indiscriminate firing towards the house                      of the president from the southern side of the lake    and at the time black and khaki dressed army personnel red into the house by shouting ‘hands up’    son cl oat time he saw Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin    and a vad another at the gate.       Ka iq shot at him with sten gun and Sheikh Kamal    wr «un inside the reception room. Bazlul Huda    get oY st at Sheikh Kamal and killed him, There-    agait Tohiv ddin (Lancer) with his force went to the    aftet “a by firing; thereafter Bazlul Huda and    firs with their force followed him, this witness as    Nev gir direction also followed them, He saw that    at T aain and his force were taking President    Mo the ground floor at that time the President    uae «otal f BPI” and soon thereafter, Bazlul    va ga and Major Nur shot at Bangabandhu with their    ejenguns, who died on the spot. The statement of    ahis witness that he saw Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin    (Lancer) at the gate, that Bazlul Huda, Major Noor    and his force approached to the first floor and that    Bazlul Huda and Major Noor shot at the President    on the stair had not been denied by Bazlul Huda in    course of cross-examination or by giving suggestion    to him and then the incriminating part of the state-    ment of this witness remain, uncontroverted.    Appellant Mohiuddin (Lancer) also did not    challenge the testimony of this witness as regards    his recognition by this witness at the gate of the    house of the President and also the statement of this    witness that he saw Mohiuddin (Lancer) and his    force bringing Bangabandhu down to the ground    floor.

      "194. As it appears to prove the charge to    leveled against the appellant Bazlul Huda, the pro-    secution examined AFM Mohitul Islam (PW 1),    Habilder Md Quddus Sikder (PW 4), Nk.Subedar    Abdul Gani (PW 5), Habilder Ganner Sohrab Ali    (PW 6), ALD Sirajul Hug (PW 12), LicutenantNaik    Abdul Khalek (PW 21), Habilder Abdul Aziz (PW    22). The leamed Judges of the High Court Division    have exhaustively reproduced their evidence in their        judgment.        ",
      "193. But however in the present appeals there    is difference in the disclosure of extra-judicial con-    fession by PWs § and 15 as whatever admission    made by Bi zlul Huda and proved by PW 8 was    direct in nature but has the element of hearsay and    the other one by PW 15 is indirect in nature and    further, the statements of the appellants have not    been depicted in verbatim as was done in the above        cited case.        ",
      "192. Question arose before the Supreme    Court of India as to whether the above is extra-ju a-    cial confession deposed by PW 9 can be the sole    basis for conviction of the accused. The Supreme    Court of India considered this point in the light of    the views taken in the case of Sahoo (supra) and    other decisions and was of the view that there is    neither any rule nor of prudence that evidence fur-    nished by extra-judicial confession cannot be relied    upon unless corroborated by some other credible    evidence. The Indian Supreme Court on evaluation    of the earlier decisions AIR 1974 SC 1545 . (1975) !     SCR 747, AIR 1975 SC 258, AIR 1966 SC 40 and    AIR 1977 SC 2274) concluded as follows:        “It thus appears that extra-judicial con-    fession appears to have been treated as a weak    piece of evidence but there is no rule of law nor    tule of prudence that it cannot be acted upon    unless corroborated. If the evidence about    extra-judicial confession comes from the mouth    of witness/witnesses who appear to be un-    biased, not even remotely inimical to the    accused, and in respect of whom nothing is    brought out which may tend to indicate that he    may have a motive for attributing an untruthful    statement to the accused; the words spoken to    by the witness are clear, unambiguous and    unmistakably convey that the accused is the                      perpetrator of the crime and nothing is omitted    by the witness which may militate against it,    then after subjecting the evidence of the witness    to a rigorous test, on the touchstone of eredi-    bility, if it passes the test, the extra-judicial con-    fession can be accepted and can be the basis of    a conviction, In such a situation to go in search    of corroboration itself tends to cast a shadow of    doubt over the evidence. If the evidence of    extra-judicial confession is reliable, trustworthy    and beyond reproach the same can be relied    upon and a conviction can be founded thereon.”        ",
      "191. Azmalul Hossain. QC im this re        has referred to the case of State of UP ws ue    Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48 on this point Lin ths    the accused killed his wife and two children. Wit-    ness PW 9 stated that. the accused was seen sifting    in the adjoining room and on seeing him this v witness    asked him as an what has been found about the    murder and in reply the accused appealed “to God to    excuse him that he had committed m    murdered his wife and two children.” The learned    Sessions Judge reproduced the statement    witness as follows:    <br>    “Oh God, pardon me, I have done a blue    der, I have murdered my wife and children.”                ",
      "190. The Supreme Court of India in the facts    ote given case observed as follows:        “But there is 2 clear distinction between the    sdmissibility of evidence and the weight to be    aiached to it. A confessional soliloquy is a    direct piece of evidence. It may be an expres-    sion of conflict of emotion, a conscious effort to    stifle the pricked conscience; an argument to    find excuse or justification for his act; or a    penitent or remorseful act of exaggeration of his    part in the crime. The tone may be soft and low;    the words may be confused; they may be    capable of conflicting interpretations depending    on witnesses, whether they are biased or honest,    intelligent or ignorant, imaginative or prosaic,    as the case may be. Generally they are    mutterings of a confused mind. Before such    evidence can be accepted, it must be established    by cogent evidence what were the exact words    used by the accused. Even if so much was    established. prudence and justice demand the    such evidence cannot be made the sole ground    of conviction. It may be used only as 2    corroborative piece of evidence.” '        ",

In Sahoo vs State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR    1966 SC 40 the convict Sahoo developed illicit inti-    ie av +, his daughter-in-law Sundar Patti (son's    There was quarrel between them on a pre-        secsion of f the occurrence and Sundar Patti        we are the house of one Md Abdullah, a neigh-    oe Foes convict brought her back and passed the    agth ber in one room of their house. On the    ne”. of the date of occurrence Sundar Patti was    ee egth injuries in the room and the convict was    gor ® nd present.

",
      "188. A confessional soliloquy is an expres-    sion of conflict of emotion, a conscious effort to    stifle the pricked conscience; or an argument to find                          excuse or justification for his act or a pertinent or     of exaggeration of part in the crime;        ",
      "187. From the statements quoted above it    appears that admittedly Farook Rahman, Sultan    Shahriar and Mohiuddin (artillery) have in course of    their conversation said they have killed the Presi-    dent and members of his family including Colonel    Jamil. It is also a fact that this statement has not    been communicated to PW 15 but this witness has    overheard the same. As it appears admissions and    confessions are dealt with in sections 24-30 of the    Evidence Act in respect of admissibility of those.    These are exceptions to the general rule of evidence    and they are placed in the category of “relevant fact”    since they are declarations against the maker, the    probative value of such admissions or confessions    do not depend upon its communication to another    and they can be admitted into evidence if they a    proved by a witness.        ",
      "186. The appellants have not denied those    statements by way of cross-examining this Witness    or by way of giving him any suggestion. On behalf    of Sultan Shahriar, suggestion was given to this    witness in evasive manner and the above statement    as made by this witness was not directly. Now the    question is, whether the above statement can be    taken as extra-judicial confession since it has no,    been communicated by the above accuseds to this    witness by stating to him that they killed the President and his family members. It also appears that    this point has not been canvassed in the Courts    below. But this being a question of law as to whether    any such statement made by an accused relating to    the incident to which he has faced trial and directly    relevant to the point involved in this case, its impli-    cation should be considered.        ",
      "185. On behalf of the appellants it was argued    the prosecution did not raise this point in the Courts    below and therefore, this point cannot be taken into    consideration at this stage and further the alleged    statement not being communicated to PW 5 by this    witness in no circumstances the same can be treated    as extra-judicial confession. PW 15 in his statement        stated that—            ",
      "184. It thus appears that appellant Bazlul    Huda admitted to this witness that he killed Sheikh    Kamal because he was giving information about the    incident outside. He also admitted that they killed    one security personnel as he was altercating with        them and thereafter on query about the cause of    death of Sheikh Naser, Captain Huda remained    he killing of the        silent and on further query about t t    President he replied that as the President queried        why they came there and asked about Shafiullah that    prompted him to shoot him and on further query    about the killing of womenfolk Bazlul Huda replied    that the situation went beyond their control and the    sepoys killed them There is no denial either directly    or indirectly about those admissions of Bazlul Huda    to PW 8 . These evidence remain uncontroverted    whether these statements may be taken as extra-judi-    cial confession in which Bazlul Huda has admitted    about his active role and killing of Sheikh Kamal by    gun shot whether the other appellants Farook Rah-    man, Sultan Shahriar. Mohiuddin (Lancer) and    Mohiuddin can be convicted relying upon this state-    ment. It thus shows that while in Bangabhahan PW    15, found Farook Rahman, Major Abdur Rashid,    Sultan Shahriar, Major Shariful Hoque Dalim,    Major Aziz Pasha, Mohiuddin (Lancer), Bazlul    Huda and others were gossiping during which they    disclosed how they killed the President and his    family members.            ",
      "182. Regarding the extra-judicial confession    as disclosed by PWs 8 and 15 in support of charge    against the appellants for murder, as it appears, as    those statements have not been challenged by the    defence during cross-examination.        183, As it appears PW 8, who was working in    the army in the rank of Captain during the relevant    lime, in his deposition stated that being deputed by    Chief of Army Staff to report after ascertaining the    Teal position in the house of the President, he visited    the said house on 15th August at about 8-45 AM.    PW 8 had stated that Major Nur Chowdhury and        zlul Huda received him and thereupon Bazlul    da took him inside the house. He narrated the    *lual position as noticed there as follows:            ",
      "181. However, because of the express provi-    sions in the existing law as referred earlier as to how    evidence are to be taken, I am of the view that the    electronic evidence produced by the prosecution in    this case cannot be used.        ",
      "180. The challenges before the criminal jus-    _. eystem are to balance the rights of the accused    eon dispensing speedy and effective justice. The    r nal justice system machinery must also meet    om pallenge of effectively dealing with the emer-    sine forms of crime and behaviour of criminals. It is    “so hoped that the obsolete laws or obsolete    tials of laws prevailing in the country will be    smended and new suitable laws will also be enacted    o respond to the needs of changing society as was    gone in India in respect of electronic evidence.        ",
      "179. Accordingly, it is high time to evaluate    she slogical developments are transforming    ow yee of the legal system. With the emer-    the he reve technologies, uncertainties arise    gence ° rd to the application of existing laws and    with ey there is a need to create new laws to    segs rir use, However, at the same time it is to    regulate ‘mind that need for regulating new techno-    e KE S aasaally prompted by social and cultural    jogies ane about the advantage of a particular tech-    ae alternatively, the scope of its misuse.        ",
      "178. Further, Bhagabati J in the case of    National Textile Workers’ Union vs PR Rama-    krishnan, AIR 1983 SC 75, Bhagwati, J speaking for    the majority observed as follows.    <br>    “We cannot allow the dead hand of the past    to stifle the growth of the living present. Law    cannot stand still; it must change with the    changing social concepts and values. If the bark    that protects the tree fails to grow and expand    along with the tree, it will either choke the tree    or if it is a living tree, it will shed that bark and    grow a new living bark for itself. Similarly, if    the law fails to respond the needs of changing    society, then either it will stifle the growth of    the society and choke its progress or if the    society is vigorous enough, it will cast away the    law which stands in the way of its growth. Law                      therefore constantly be on the move    i itself to the fast-changing society and    not lag behind.        ",
      "177. However, the Evidence Act of 1872 isa    procedural law and at the same time is an ongoing    statute. According to Francis Benion, the principle    of interpretation of an ongoing statute should be that    Parliament intends the Court to apply to an ongoing    Act a construction that continuously updates its    wordings to allow for changes in an Act which was    initially framed. While it remains law it has to be    treated as always speaking.        ",
      "176. The modes for recording evidence has    been expressly laid down in section 353 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure which provides that except as    otherwise provided, all evidence taken under    chapter XX, XXII and XXIII shall be taken in the    presence of the accused, or, when his personal    attendance is dispensed with, in presence of his    Advocate. This shows that though the actual physi-    cal presence of the accused is necessary while    taking evidence, it may be dispensed with in certain    circumstances.        ",
      "175. Inthe case of State of Maharashtra vs p,.    Praful B. Desai, (2003) 4 scc 601 the Supreme    Court of India ruled that the evidence taken from 4    witness through video conferencing is Compatible    with the requirements of the Code.        ",
      "174. However as regards admissibility of a    statement recorded in a compact disk or video cas-    sette or in a television channel, if the accused does    not deny his statement or admission, there is no    difficulty in admitting such digital or electronic    evidence as documentary evidence. However, if the        accused denies the statement or admission, the’        question of its admissibility has to be looked into    under the prevailing law of evidence. As it appears    the expression ‘evidence’ has been defined in    section 3 of the Evidence Act which is as follows:        ‘Evidence’ means and includes—    <br>    (1) all statements which the Court permits    or requires to be made before it by a witness, in    relation to matters of fact under enquiry; such    statements are called oral evidence;  <br>      . (2) All documents produced for the    inspection of the Court, such documents are    called documentary evidence,        However in India sub-section 2 of section 3    of the Evidence Act as above has been substi-    tuted in the year is as follows:  <br>      (2) all documents including electronic record    produced for the inspection of the Court; such    ?    documents are called documentary evidence        go, in terms of the above amendmen, in    in criminal matters, evidence can also be    of electronic record as video Cassette    and video conferencing.              ",
      "173. Regarding the admission of digital or electric evidence, as it appears the party seeking to admit any statement or admission of any person recorded in any person recorded in a compact disk or video cassette or any interview conducted by any television channel relating to a relevant fact or facts in issue, must also produce the original compact disk or video cassette or the programme published in the television channel with the certificate of the producer of the programme and further the signature of the producer in the certificate has also to be proved. In the present appeals, these requirements have not been met.        ",
      "172. However, as it appears in terms of    section 57 of Evidence Act, the Court itself may take    cognizance of certain matter which are so notorious    or so clearly established that the evidence of their                      existence is deemed unnecessary. But as it appears    the alleged statement made by appellant    Rahman to a reporter of the issue of the ''Sunday    Times” is in the nature of hearsay evidence     prosecution did not examine the reporter Who inter    viewed the above appellant,    admission of digital or    electronic evidence, as it appears the party     to admit any statement or admission of any pers     recorded in a compact disk or video cassette or al ,    interview conducted by any television a rake    relating to a relevant fact or facts in Issue, must also    disk or video cassette        produce the original compact on    d in the television chan-        or the programme publishe    nel with the certificate of the producer of the pro-    sume certifying the date and place of the record        ",
      "171. PW 58, exhibited the issue of the    Sunday Times\" dated 8-5-1976, which was marked    Exhibit X with a note of objection by the defence,    Stating that he while acting as Director, Ministry of    Foreign Affairs, at the request of Criminal Investi-    gation Department, CID, collected a copy of the    Sunday Times\" through the then Councilor of Ban-    gladesh High Commission at London, in which the    appellant Farook Rahman, admitted his complicity    by saying \"I helped to kill Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,    dare to put me on trial\", PW 58, also proved the for-    warding letter with the signature of the Councilor by    which the above Journal was sent to him. PW 58    also exhibited with objection Exhibit 32, a video    cassette broadcasted by Granada Independent    Television in the UK on 2nd August 1976, along    with notarised certificate issued by Keith Robert    Hopkins, Notary Public, certifying that to the best of    his knowledge, information and belief, the said    video cassette is an authentic copy of a television    programme. Further, Mr Boktiar Hossain, PW 59, a    local video recorder, also proved the video cassette,    Exhibit-12, in which Major Rashid and Farook Rah-    man, in an interview by Anthony Mascaranthus    stated that they killed Sheikh Mujib along with his    family. According to the Learned Attorney the issue    of \"Sunday Times\", Exhibit X, is a document within    the meaning of section 3 of Evidence Act in which    Farook Rahman admitted his participation in the    killing of the President while giving his interview    and further the incident of 15th August 1975 being a    sad historic fact in Bangladesh, any book or    document in reference to the above incident may be    taken as judicial notice under the provisions of    section 57 of the Evidence Act on such a fact and    further since Faruque Rahman during cross exami-    nation did not deny his said interview with Anthony    Mascaranthus, the video cassettes, Material Exhibits    32 and Exhibit 12, may also be admitted as        evidence.

The learned Counsels, in support of their    contentions, referred the cases of Nurul Islam vs    Sate, 43 DLR (AD) 6, Hazrat Khan @ Hazrat Ali vs    Sate, 54 DLR 636, Moslemuddin vs State, 38 DLR    (AD) 311, Safdor Ali vs Crown, 5 DLR (FC) 107 and    Moyecuddin vs State, 31 DLR (AD) 37 . Mr Anisul    Hug and learned Attorney-General submitted that    the evidence that came forth from the deposition of    the witnesses proved the charge of murder and    further Exhibit X, the copy of the “Sunday Times”    and also the electronic evidence, Material Exhibits    12 and 32 also proved charge of murder. The learned    Attomey-General and Mr Azmalul Hossain to prove    the charge of murder also relied upon the extra-        judicial confessions of the appellants as disclosed by    PWs 8 and 15,            ",

Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, learned Coun-    cagaring for Sultan Shahriar, further submitted        «el ee js no reliable evidence regarding Sultan    th nes complicity in the murder of the President    seb of his family; he did not go to House    mm a ot Dhanmondi; the High Court Division    Noo iy jaw in relying upon the testimony of PW 14    cee his presence at the night parade at Balur-    ” reve though there is no corroborating evidence    a and if the evidence of PW 14 is disbelieved    i remains only evidence against Sultan Shahriar    or ding his presence at the Radio Station at about    ant 4M on 15th August and this fact has no nexus    vp the murder of the President and his family    embers 28 being reemployed with effect from 15th    zst, 1975, his presence in the Radio Station was    : oat of his official duty which he had carried out as        per direction of his Commanding Officer.        ",
      "167. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, learned Coun-    sel appearing for the appellants Syed Farook    Rahman and Mohiuddin (Artillery) further    submitted that there is no evidence in support of the    charge for causing the murder of the President and    the members of his family by the appellants and PW    1 is not an eye-witness of the occurrence and Mohi-    uddin (artillery) is not an FIR named accused and    his inclusion in the case is a product of concoction:    the story of hoisting of flag and playing bugle in the    house of the President just immediate before the    occurrence as stated by the P.Ws are not believable    since PWs 1-3 stated that at that time the assailants    were already in the house of the President; there 5    at all no evidence on record to show the presence of    Farook Rahman in the house of the President at the    relevant time ; the presence of Mohiuddin (artillery)    with cannon at Kalabagan playground has not bee\"    substantiated by adducing reliable evidence; in vie\"    of withholding of tank crews an adverse presumption           may be drawn against the prosecution as if they    were produced they would not have supported the    case; in view of the evidence as reveal.    ee the lips of the prosecution Witnesses the real    ad ri of the incident Was Jobaida Rashid; from the    inne of the PWs it will also be evident that the    oi ant had no common intention Or preconcert    af og their being involved in the under of the    section 302/34 was illegel.        ",
      "166. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, learned Coun,    sel appearing for the appellant Bazlul Hud, ana    Mohiuddin (Lancer), further submitted that they. ‘    no reliable evidence in support of the proseciy; on    story that these appellants have been recognised p,,    the informant at the place of occurrence, w.    allegation that Bazlul Huda shot to death Sheiks    Kamal and Bangabandhu is also based on contr,    dictory evidence on record; the prosecution fh,    withheld vital witnesses such as, Sheikh Yunus Aj;    Colonel Moshiud Doula and Colonel Mahmudy    Hasan purposely 2s their evidence would have bee,    unfavourable to the prosecution and therefore 2,    adverse inference may be drawn against the    prosecution for withholcing those vital witnesses.    the allegation that Mohiuddin (Lancer) was taking    the President down from the first floor is based on    no reliable evidence on record and further the    recognition of Mohiuddin (Lancer) by the witnesses    at the place of occurrence is totally absurd and    unbelievable story and further the evidence on    record about the presence of Bazlul Huda and Mohi-    uddin (Lancer) at the place of occurrence is also    contradictory.

      "165. Regarding the fifth ground i.e. the    murder of the President and the members of his    family, the learned Counsels for the appellants made    common submissions that the learned Judges of the    High Court Division upon superficial consideration    of the evidence on record and on mere conjecture    and surmise confirmed the death sentence of the    appellants and failed to consider that there is no    legal evidence on record in support of the charges    under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and that the    appellants along with other accuseds attended the    night parade merely as a routine work and further,    their presence at the parade could not be connected    with the murder of the President and his family    members and the killing of the President and his    family members was a revolt to overthrow the then    Government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and in    consequence of such revolt only, the President ang ;    his family members were killed by the army    which the appellants were not involved.

      "164. The above evidence prove that the appel-    lants and other accuseds made criminal conspiracy to    murder the President and the members of his family.        ",
      "163. But as it appears most of them were    removed army officer and PWs 44 and 47 proved    that they were absorbed in service by General Ziaur    Rahman after he came to power on 7th November,    1975 and earlier when Khondker Mustaque Ahmed,    selected person, was dethroned by Khaled    Mosharraf they left the country on the evening of    3rd March . If the evidence of PWs 44, 45 and 47 are    read along with those of PW 60 it will appear that    the appellants and other co-accuseds, as part of their    premeditated plan arranged night parade and then    came out from the cantonment with tanks and other    arms without authorisation and some then went to    the house of the President situated at Road No. 32,    and also other key points such as Radio Station,    Minto Road, BDR Headquarter, Rakhibahini Head-    quarter with a view to prevent the Government and    security forces from interfering in their object of    killing the President and his family members and    that afier killing of the President and his family    members they compelled the Chief of Army, Navy                      and Air Force to express their allegiance after the    killing and accepting Khondker Mustaque Ahmed as    the President of the Republic and that thereafter they    stayed at Bangabhaban and guarded Khondker    Mustaque Ahmed and the Radio Station so that any    other could not topple Khandaker Mushtaque    Ahammed and they attended in the oath taking    ceremonies of the President, his Cabinet although    they were not supposed to be present al such    national ceremonies being petty officers in the army    and some of them including the appellant Sultan    Shahriar were removed officers and some of them        arranged for burying the dead bodies and the act of    flecing away from the country after the incident of    3rd November and taking shelter in Bangkok and    thereafter their absorption at the different Bangla-    deshi Missions by late General Ziaur Rahman and    then on removal from the service after their abortive    attempt to revolt against Ziaur Rahman and their    staying abroad are the circumstances which prove    that they were involved in the killing of the    President and other members of his family. These    conducts of appellants other than accused persons    are relevant under section 8 of the Evidence Act and    may be taken as corroborative evidence for fur-    nishing further proof of the guilt @f the appellants    and other accused persons.        ",
      "162. The Third learned Judge however was of    the view that the deployment of some of the appel-    lants and other accuséd persons in the foreign    embassies could not be taken as reward for their    involvement in the carnage of 1 5th August and so no    adverse inference could be drawn against them by    reason of such employment.        ",
      "161. In support of the subsequent conduct of    the appellants ad other accuseds, the prosecution has    examined PWs 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 20, 23, 37, 42, 44,    45, 46, 47, 49 and 60 . PW 9 stated that on 15th    August at about 3-00 PM he went to the house of the    President as per direction of PW 45 for ascertaining    the condition of that house where Bazlul Huda    received him at the gate of that house and under the    supervision of Mohiuddin (Lancer) the dead body of    the President was sent to Tongipara through a heli-    copter. PW 12 stated that he saw Farook Rahman    while he was coming towards Mirpur Road from    Road No.32 with a tank at 7-15 AM on 15th August.    PW 15 saw Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar, Bazlul    Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) at Bangabhaban 0n                              the day of occurrence at about 4-00 PM, PW 16 saw    Farook Rahman on a jeep in front of Shanghai Res-    gaurant, Kalabagan, Mirpur Road, on 1Sth August in    the moming While he was approaching towards    south of the house of the President. PW 16 after    going 1 Bangabhaban a” saw Mohiuddin (Artil-    lery) with his troops, PW 20 stated that he saw    Shahar and Farook Rahman and other officers    inside Bangabhaban ater the occurrence. PW 23    ed that after the incident he did not see Farook    Rahman and Mohiuddin (Lancer) in the Lancer Unit    and heard that they were then staying at Banga-    phaban. pW 37 stated that after the incident he at the    studio No.2 of the Radio Station, saw Shahriar,    along with other co-accuseds were preparing speech    of khondker Mustaque Ahmed of Bangladesh Radio    on 15th August 1975 at 7-00 AM. PW 42 stated that    he found Shahriar, Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Farook    Rahman in the Radio Station on 15th August when    the Chief of Army, Navy and Air Force came there    to broadcast their allegiance by radio and that he    giso found Bazlul Huda and Nur when he went to    road No.32 on 15th August at 11-00 AM for taking    pictures of the victims as per direction of the autho-    rity and that he also saw Shahriar Rashid, Farook    Rahman, Mohiuddin (Lancer) and other accused        ersons in the President’s room at Bangabhaban in    the aftemoon. PW 44 stated that while the officers    involved in the killing of 15th August and 3rd    November, were staying in Bangkok, the so-called    “sepahi biplob” (armed revolution) occurred on 7th    November, 1975, and Major General Ziaur Rahman    became the exclusive powerful leader and that after    taking over power, he repatriated the officers    involved in the killing of 15th August and 3rd    November by arranging their service at foreign    embassies of Bangladesh. He further stated that    those officers made abortive attempt of revolt    against General Ziaur Rahman and thereafter they    were removed from the service and thereafter they    led their lives abroad as fugitive. The appellants did    not challenge the statements of this witness, PW 45    stated that at the oath taking ceremony of Khondker    Mustaque Ahmed as President, Bazlul Huda, Farook    Ahmed and other co-accuseds were present, PWs 46    noticed Farook Rahman, Shahriar, Bazlul Huda and    other accused persons were sitting beside Khondker        MAJOR BAZLUL Hupa vs State (Md Tafeceul Islam J 47        Mustaque Ahmed, who was sitting on the chair of    the President at about 3-30 PM at Banga Bhaban on    the day of occurrence. PW 47 also saw Farook    Rahman, Shahriar Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Bazlul    Huda at the oath taking ceremony of Khandaker    Mustaque Ahmed and his Cabinet and that after the    incident of 3rd November, Major Abdur Rashid and    other accused persons left for Bangkok. PW 49    stated that on 15th August Major Dalim introduced    him with Farook Rahman after broadcasting the    allegiance by the Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air    Force in the Radio Station. PW 60 stated that a file    was opened for absorbing some army officers in the    Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 8th June, 1976 and    thereafter, as per letter of Army Headquarter under    Memo. dated 15th August, 1976, Mohiuddin    (Lancer), Bazlul Huda, Sultan Shahriar and other    co-accused have been deputed to the Ministry of    Foreign A ffairs.        ",
      "160. As it appears according to the Prosecy    tion story, the appellants along with other ACCUSe,    arranged the parade on the night of 14th August, “i    in the army rule though there was no Provision for    taking arms at such exercise they took arms from the    armory and marched towards Road No. 32, Dhan.    mondi where the President was residing, Minto    Road where the Cabinet Ministers were Staying, the    Radio Station and in front of Rakhibahini Head.    quarter and setting up cannons aiming Rakhibahin;    Headquarter and Road No. 32 to use those if there    was any resistance from the Rakhibahini or othe;    forces and they also took cannon with ammunition    and tanks which could not be taken out of canton.    ment during normal time. These arms, ammunition    and heavy artillery like cannons and tanks they    carried just before the occurrence and set up those    mainly with the motive to resist and prevent the    counter-attack of Government and other security    forces. These preparations of the appellants and    other accuseds have relevancy with the occurrence    in that they took those measures in a calculated way    to bring about the premeditated action of killing.    After taking all these precautions, they attacked the    house of the President situated at Road No.32    Dhanmondi R/A and killed the President and all the    members of his family.        ",
      "159. The first learned Judge also disbelieved    PW 46 about his identification of the appellants    Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar, Bazlul Huda and    other accuseds at Bangabhaban on the reasoning    that there was nothing on record to show that he    knew them earlier. This finding of the learned Judge    is inconsistent, inasmuch as the learned Judge    himself believed the presence of these appellants at    Bangabhaban and made adverse inference regarding    their presence only in the oath taking ceremony on    the ground that they, being junior army officers,    were not supposed to remain present at Ban,    bhaban in the President's oath taking ceremon.    PWes 15 and 47 also deposed that they saw them ..    Bangabhaban. Therefore, the learned second J 7    has rightly believed witness PW 46, Be        ",
      "158. Accordingly, I am in complete agree-    ment with the views of the learned second Judge    that the learned Sessions Judge inadvertently    recorded the suggestion in question in affirmative    although PW 24 replied in negative.        ",
      "157. The first learned Judge however, dis-    believed PW 24 on the reasoning that in course of    cross-examination on behalf of Farook Rahman in    answer to a suggestion he stated that as per version    of the police he deposed against the accuseds on the    apprehension that otherwise he would be made an    accused in the case as he was found present at the    house of Sherniabat. The second learned Judge,    however, believed PW 24 on the reasonings that a    perusal of his statement in its entirety in cross would    sugeest that he denied the above suggestion but the    learned Sessions Judge recorded his statement in the    positive form inadvertently and as it appears PW 24    denied the almost similar suggestion made to him on    behalf of Colonel Mohiuddin (artillery). Further,    this witness deposed in Court on 19th October,    1997, after more than 22 years of the occurrence and    at this belated stage there was no occasion for him    to harbour any apprehension of being implicated in    Sherniabat’s murder case since the cases were filed    long ago and moreover, the above statement was    made while deposing before the Court and not        before the police.        ",
      "156. Further regarding previous conduct of    the appellants depositions show that PW 11 recog-    nised Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook Rahman,    Mohiuddin (Lancer), and Bazlul Huda at the night    parade. PW 12 recognised Mohiuddin (Lancer),    Farook Rahman and Bazlul Huda at the night parade    on 14th August. PW 13 recognised Major Mohi-    uddin (Lancer) and Farook Rahman. PW 14    recognised Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Shahriar. PWs    17 and 18 recognised Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-    uddin (Artillery) at the parade ground on 14th night.    PWs 21 and 22 recognised Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-    uddin (Artillery) and Bazlul Huda at the parade    ground. PW 23 recognised Lieutenant Colonel    Farook Rahman at the parade ground. PW 24 recog-    nised. Farook Rahman, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Artillery) and Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar at the    parade ground. PW 25 recognised Mohiuddin    (artillery) and Farook Rahman at the night parade.    PW 27 recognized Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) at    Kalabagan. PW 32 recognized Mohiuddin (Artil-    lery) at the night parade. PW 34 recognized Lieuten-    ant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery) at    Kalabagan. PW 35 recognised Colonel Mohiuddin    (artillery) and Farook Rahman at the night parade    ground, PW 39 recognized Farook Rahman and    Mohiuddin (Lancer) at the night parade ground. PW    40 stated that Farook Rahman told him that they    were moving to topple the autocratic Government,    but instead of toppling the Government, they killed    the President and the members of his family. The    evidence of the above PWs, which have been dis-    cussed in detail while considering the charge of    criminal conspiracy, shows that the appellants along    with co-accuseds and their troops marched from the                      parade ground towards the key points, took control    or those key points by deploying troops with    artillery and then their object was materialised. All    these acts of the accused are done in one series in the    course of carrying through the design in question    there is community and continuity of purpose. These    conducts of the appellants are relevant which has no    reasonable explanation other than their guilt.        ",
      "155. It thus appears that PWs 11, 12, 13, 14,        23, 24, 25, 35, 39 and 40 have recognised Farook        Rahman, PWs 11, 12, 14 and 39 have recognised        Mohiuddin (Lancer), PWs 17, 18, 21, 22, 26, 27, 32,        34 and 53 have recognised Mohiuddin (Artillery),        PW 14 . recognised Sultan Shahrior and PWs 11, 12,        21] and 22 recognised Bazlul Huda in the said        conspiracy. Further the defence did not challenge        the incriminating part of the evidence of these wit-        nesses about their complicity, such as, night parade    continued beyond the scheduled timetable till 3-    30/4-00 AM, that though there was no provision for    amalgamation of two different units of army at the    night parade but even then amalgamation was made    and that they took ammunition from the kote which    was strictly prohibited and that by violating army    rule they took the tanks and cannons outside the    cantonment during peace period and deployed those    at key points just before the incident and that some    removed army officers attended the night parade and    that there were confidential talks among the accused    officers keeping the jawans in fall-in position by    inciting them and that in terms of the conspiracy    some officers and jawans of the two units including    appellants came out of the cantonment and went to    the house of the President and killed him and his    family members while other officers and jawans    including some appellants remained deployed in    other key points.        ",
      "154. The above evidence shows that Major    Rashid and Farook Rahman, who as the records    show are close relation, arranged the night parade on    14th night with a view to fulfil their premeditated    plan of conspiracy. Major Rashid, as the records    show, is also a close relation of Khondaker Mus-    taque Ahmed. Records also show that Lieutenant    Colonel Momen, the Commanding Officer of Ist    Lancer Unit was on leave upto 15th August and    Farook Rahman, as 2 IC of the said unit by utilising    the absence of Colonel Momen took control of Ist    Lancer Unit and he in collusion with near relation    Major Rashid, Commanding Officer of 2nd Field    Artillery, as well as other accuseds as a part of cons-    piracy arranged the night parade on 14th night and    dragged it till the early hours of 15th August, and    removed army officers also attended the said parade    and then the officers talked secretly in the office of    Mohiuddin (Lancer) and that Faruque Rahman,    Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) incited the    jawans by their speeches to the effect that Rakhi-    bahini would attack them or that monarchy will be    established and as per their direction the jawans    took heavy arms and ammunition which could be    used during the war time only.        ",
      "153. PW 40 stated that during the relevant    time, he was a Lieutenant of Lancer Unit of which    Farook Rahman was the commander and he    attended the night parade and he handed over the    parade to Mohiuddin (Lancer) who then handed    over the parade to Farook Rahman and that the    parade continued till 2-00/3-00 AM although it was    supposed to close up at 12 at night and that Farook    Rahman told him to take care about the regiment    and to close down the gate and he further stated that    in reply to his query, Farook Rahman told him that    they were going to remove autocratic Government.    The defence did not challenge the testimony of this    witness although this witness specifically stated that    Major Farook and other persons were moving to    topple the Government. PW 53 stated that he was 4    Subedar Major of Artillery unit and Mohiuddin    (Artillery) was Papa Battery Commander of thal    unit and that Farook Rahman used to visit the office    of their commanding officer Major Rashid and    talked with him many times in the month of August.    1975 . He further stated that Major Rashid arranged    the night training programme in August and as per    programme, he fixed the 14th August night for the                      purpose and that Mohiuddin took over parade from    Captain Jahangir and then he handed over the    parade to Major Rashid, He further stated that at    about 10-00 PM Major Rashid and Farook Rahman    came to the verandah of his office and some time    thereafter they jointly left the place with a jeep.

      "150. PW 32 stated that he was a jawan of    artillery unit, in which, Major Mohiuddin (Artillery)    was their commander and that he attended the night    parade and at the parade he recognised Major    Rashid, Mohiuddin (Artillery), Major Zubair    Siddique, Captain Mostafa and Lieutenant Hasan    and that the parade continued till 3-00/3-30 AM    when also Habilder Muzaffar made them to fall-in    and at that time those officers and Major Dalim were    present.

The testimony of    this witness has not been challenged by the defence    and the same remains uncontroverted.        ",
      "149. PW 26 stated that he was a jawan of    Artillery unit during the relevant time and Mohi-    uddin (Artillery) was commander of Papa Battery of    the said unit and Major Rashid directed him to keep    the key of ammunition store with him and at about    11-00/11-30 AM Major Rashid and Captain Jahan-    gir came in front of the ammunition store with 10/12    jawans of artillery and lancer units and as per    direction of Major Rashid he unlocked the ammuni-                       tion store and then as per direction of Major Rashid,    the jawans took cannons, rifles, stenguns, SMG and    pistols ete.

      "147. The defence did not challenge the testi-    mony of this witness so far as it related to amalga-    mation of units of Lancer and Artillery by Farook        Major BAZLUL Hupa vs State (Md Tafeczul Islam J) 43        Rahman, the briefing of Faruque Rahman to the    units and the presence of Major Abdur Rashid there.    In course of cross-examination, this witness stated    that there was no provision for joint parade of    different units in the yearly parade.

Thereafter at about 3-30/4-00 AM the trucks loaded    with cannon started moving and that he was in the    vehicle with Major Mohiuddin (Artillery); their    truck stopped beside the Dhanmondi Lake at around    4-00 AM and then Mohiuddin directed them to    install the cannons aiming the Road No. 32 and    Rakkhi Bahani Head Quarter and as per his    direction, the cannons were fixed aiming Road No.    32 and then Mohiuddin directed them to fire can-    non-ball whenever he would direct them to do so    and some time thereafter, they heard sounds of firing    from the house of the President and at that time, as    per direction of Mohiuddin they fired 4 rounds of    cannon-bal].

      "137. According to the prosecution, the    appellants along with other accused persons hatched    up a conspiracy the killing of the President and his    kith and kin with a view to mitigate their persona]    vengeance and also to fulfil their personal ambition    and with that end in view, they arranged a night    parade on 14th August, 1975, and in the night    parade the appellant Farook Rahman and other co-    accuseds incited the jawans attending it, took arms    from the kote, deployed officers and jawans at key    points and then some of them came to the official    residence of the President and brutally killed him    and his family members and that such yearly night    parade starts in the evening and ends at 11-00 PM    but the night parade of 14th August continued till    early hours of 15th August and moreover, there is no    provision for amalgamation of two units of army in    the parade but the appellants and other accuseds for    the fulfilment of their criminal object in violation of    the Rules amalgamated Lancer unit and Artillery    unit and that further though there is prohibition for    carrying ammunition at such exercise but the    appellants and the co-accuseds carried ammunition    from the kote for the implemen- tation of the object,    it will be necessary to keep in view the limited scope    n this appeal under Article 103(3) of the    Constitution against the judgments and orders of    conviction and sentence by which the High Court    Division confirmed the conviction and sentence    passed by the trial Court. The appellants have not    raised any point as to whether the trial of the    appellants has been vitiated by reason of mis-    reading, non reading or non consideration of the    evidence on record, Despite that we have afforded                      learned Counsels to argue the appeals at length on merit of the evidence on record for ends of justice since the appellants have been sentence is death.        ",
      "136. So, in terms of the principle    above, each conspirator plays his Separate part in    one integrated and united effort lo achieve the    common purpose. Each one is aware that he has a    part to play in a general conspiracy though he ma    not know all its secrets or the means by which the    common purpose is to be accomplished. The evil    scheme may be promoted by a few, some may drop    out and some may join at a later Stage but he    Conspiracy continues until it is broken up. There    as laid down    general plan to accomplish the Commo,    design by such means as may from time to time tis    found expedient. New techniques may be inventes    and new means may be devised for advancement -    the common plan. The common intention of th.    conspirators then is to work for the furtherance of    the common design. Conspirators do not discuss the    plans in the presence of the stranger or outsider    Since privacy and secrecy are the elements of    criminal conspiracy it is difficult to obtain direc,    evidence in its proof. It can, therefore, be proved by    evidence of surrounding circumstances and conduc;    of the accused both before and after the commission    of the crime.        ",
      "135. If thus appears that, in order to cons-    titute the offence of conspiracy, there must first be a    combining together of two or more persons in the    conspiracy; secondly, an act or illegal omission must    take place in pursuance of that conspiracy in order    io the doing of that thing. It is not necessary that the    abetter should concert the offence with the person    who commits it. ]t is sufficient if he engages in the    conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is    committed. Chapter VA, introduced a new offence    defined by section 120A. That offence is called the    offence of criminal conspiracy and consists in a    mere agreement by two or more persons to do or    cause 10 be done an illegal act or an act which is not    illegal by illegal means; there is a proviso to the    section which says that no agreement except an    agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a    criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the    agreement is done by one or more parties to such    dercement in pursuance thereof,        ",
      "134. Ina later case in Suresh Chandra Bahri    vs Gurbachan Singh AIR 1994 SC 2420, the    Supreme Court of India held as observed:    <br>    “In the above context we may refer to the    provisions of section 120A of the Indian Penal    Code which defines criminal conspiracy, It    provides that when two or more persons agree    to do, or cause to be done. (1) an illegal act, or    (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means,    such agreement is designated a criminal conspi-    racy; provided that no agreement except an    agreement to commit an offence shall amount    to criminal conspiracy unless some act besides    the agreement is done by one or more parties to    such agreement in pursuance thereof. Thus, a    cursory look to the provisions contained in    section 120A reveal that a criminal conspiracy    envisages an agreement between two or more    persons to commit an illegal act or an act which    by itself may not be illegal but the same is done    or executed by illegal means. Thus the essential    ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy    is the agreement to commit an offence. In a case    where the agreement is for accomplishment of    an act which by itself constitutes an offence,    then in that event no overt act is necessary to be    proved by the prosecution because in such a    fact situation criminal conspiracy is established    by proving such an agreement, In other words,    where the conspiracy alleged is with regard to    commission of a serious crime of the nature as    contemplated in section 120B read with the    provision to sub-section (2) of section 120A of    the IPC, then in that event mere proof of an    agreement between the accused for commission    of such a crime alone is enough to bring about    a conviction under section 120B and the proof    of any overt act by the accused or by any one of    them would not be necessary. The provisions in    such a situation do not require that each. and    every person who is a party to the conspiracy    must do some overt act towards the fulfilment    of the object of conspiracy, the essential ingredient                      being an agreement between the conspirators to commit the crime and if these requirements and ingredients are established the act would fall within the tapping of the provisions contained in section 120B since from its very nature a conspiracy must be    hatched in complete secrecy, because     the whole purpose may frustrate and it is    common experience and goes without saying that    only in very rare cases one may come across    direct evidence of a criminal conspiracy to    commit anv crime and in most of the cases it is    only the circumstantial evidence which is avail-    able from which an inference giving rise to the    conclusion of an agreement between two or    more persons to commit an offence may be    legitimately drawn.”        ",
      "133. Reference to sections 120A and 120B of    the Penal Code which have brought the “Law of    Conspiracy” in the then India, will show that those    are in line with the English law by making the overt    act unessential when the conspiracy is to commit    any punishable offence and the provisions of section    120A would make these aspects clear beyond doubt.    Entering into an agreement by two or more persons    to do an illegal act or legal act by illegal means is the    very quintessence of the offence of conspiracy:    Section 10 also has a reference to section 120A of    the Penal Code which provides: “when two or more    Persons agree to do, or cause to be done, (a) an ille-    gal act, or (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal    means, such an agreement is designated a criminal    conspiracy.” A proviso has been added which                      provides that no agreement except an agreement to    commit offence shall amount to conspiracy.    Therefore, it is apparent that a prima facie case of    racy has to be established for the application    conspiracy‘    of section 10 of the Evidence Act. There must be    reasonable ground to believe that two or more        persons have conspired together in the light of the    language of section 120A of the Penal Code. In    Kehar Singh vs State, AIR 1988 SC 1883 section    120A is explained in the following manner:        “This section mainly could be divided into    two: the first part talks of where there is reason-    able ground to believe that two or more persons    have conspired to commit an offence or an    actionable wrong, and it is only when this con-    dition precedent is satisfied that the subsequent    part of the section comes into operation and it is    material to note that this part of the section talks    of reasonable grounds to believe that two or    more persons have conspired together and this    evidently has reference to section 120A where it    is provided “When two or more persons agree    to do, or cause to be done”. This further has    been safeguarded by providing a proviso that no    agreement except an agreement to commit an    offence shall amount to criminal conspiracy. It    will be therefore necessary that a prima facie    case of conspiracy has to be established for    application of section 10 . The second part of    section talks of anything said, done or written    by any one of such persons in reference to the    common intention after the time when such    intention was first entertained by any one of    them is relevant fact against each of the persons    believed to be so conspiring as well for the    purpose for proving the existence of the    conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that    any such person was a party to it. It is clear that    this second part permits the use of evidence    which otherwise could not be used against the    accused person. It is well settled that act or    action of one of the accused could not be used    as evidence against the other. But an exception    has been carved out in section 10 in cases of    conspiracy. The second part operates only when    the first part of the section is clearly established    i.e. there must be reasonable ground to believe    that two or more persons have conspired        together in the light of the language of section    120A. It is only then the evidence of action or    statements made by one of the accused could be    used as evidence against the other.”        ",
      "132. It will be thus seen that the most import-    ant ingredient of the offence of conspiracy is the    agreement between two or more persons to do an    illegal act. The illegal act may or may nor be done    in pursuance of agreement, but the very agreement    is an offence and is punishable.        ",
      "131. Coleridge, J. while summing up the Case    to Jury in Regina vs Murphy, (1837) 173 ER sq)        (508) pertinently states:    <br>    “Tam bound to tell you, that although th,    common design is the root of the charge, jx is    not necessary to prove that these two Parties    came together and actually agreed in terms to    have this common design and to pursue it by    common means, and so to carry it into execy.    tion. This is not necessary, because in many    cases of the most clearly established conspi-    racies there are no means of proving any such    thing, and neither law nor commonsense    requires that it should be proved. If you fing    that these two persons pursued by their acts the    same object, often by the same means, one per-    forming one part of an act, so as to complete it,    with a view to the attainment of the object    which they were pursuing, you will be at liberty    to draw the conclusion that they have been    engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object.    The question you have to ask yourselves is,    “Had they this common design, and did they    pursue it by these common means—the design    being unlawful ?”        ",
      "130. He explained “Mere knowledge of and    mental consent to a crime about to be committed by    another does not make a mana conspirator, but quite    a slight participation in the plan will be sufficient,”        ",
      "129. Glanville Williams in the “Criminal    Law” (Second Ed.382) explains the proposition    with an illustration:        “The question arose in an Lowa case, but it    was discussed in terms of conspiracy rather    than of accessoryship. D, who had grievance    against P told E that if he would whip P some-    one would pay his fine, F replied that he did not    want anyone to pay his fine, that he had a    grievance of his own against P and that he    would whip him at the first opportunity, E    whipped P. D was acquitted of conspiracy    because there was no agreement for “ concert of    action”, no agreement to “co-operate”,        ",
      "128. The English Law on this matter is well    settled. The following passage from Russell on Crime    (12th Edition Volume 1, 202) may be usefully noted:  <br>      “The gist of the offence of conspiracy then    lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the pur-    pose for which the conspiracy is formed, nor in    attempting to do them, nor in inciting others to    do them, but in the forming of the scheme or    agreement between the parties. Agreement is    essential. Mere knowledge, or even discussion,    of the plan is not, per se, enough.”        ",
      "127. Under the common law, conspiracy con-    sists in an agreement between two or more persons    to achieve an unlawful object, unlawful being used    in a special sense here. The offence consists in the    combining. So long as such a design rests In    intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree    to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself.    The offence is, therefore, complete though no    further act is done in pursuance of the agreement    and, provided that if the stage of negotiations has    been passed, it will be a conspiracy even “where the    parties had not settled the means to be employed.” It    is not necessary that a person charged with conspi-    racy should also be an accomplice.        ",
      "126. The elements of criminal conspiracy are    (a) an agreement between two or more persons, (b)    to do an illegal act, or (c) to do a legal act by illegal    means, and (d) an overt act done in pursuance of the    conspiracy. Further, in order to prove a charge of    criminal conspiracy for an offence under section    120B of the Penal Code, the prosecution need not    prove that the perpetrators expressly agreed to do or    caused to be done the illegal act; the agreement may    be proved even by necessary implication. In a    conspiracy, persons are often required to do various    acts at various stages and even if for the first time    they come into conspiracy at a latter stage they are    members of the conspiracy provided their act is    calculated to promote the object of the conspiracy. It    is no doubt true that the offence is complete as soon    as an agreement, is made between the conspirators    and in that case they would be punishable under    section 120B. The essence of the offence is the com-    bination of agreement express or implied, the actus    reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to commit an    offence, not execution of it. It is enough if it is    shown a meeting of minds, a consensus to affect an    unlawful purpose, It can be established by direct or    circumstantial evidence. Privacy and secrecy are    main characteristics of a conspiracy than of a loud    discussion in an elevated place open to public view.    It is not always possible to give direct evidence    about the date, place and time of the formation of    the conspiracy, about the persons that took part in its    formation, about the objects which they set before    themselves as the object of conspiracy and about. the    manner in which the object of conspiracy is to be                      carried out—all these are matters of inference that    can be drawn from the facts of the case.

Besides various decisions of this Divi-    sion on this point, in the case of Hargun Sundar Das     vs State of Maharashtra, AIR 1970 SC 1514 the    Supreme Court of India, while considering the scop¢    of its jurisdiction to assess the evidence in an appeal    ON conviction also observed as follows:    <br>    “We may appropriately repeat what ha    often been Pointed out by this Court under                      Article 136 of the Constitution, this Court does    not normally proceed to review the evidence in    criminal cases unless the trial is Vitiated by    some illegality or material irregularity of    procedure or the trial is held in violation of    rules of natural justice resulting in unfairness to    the accused or the judgment or order under    appeal has resulted in grave miscarriage of    justice. This article reserves to this Court a    special discretionary power to interfere in    suitable cases when for special reasons it    considers that interference is called for in the    larger interest of justice,”        ",
      "121. Article 103(3) is couched in the verbatim    language of Article 136 of the Constitution of India.        ",
      "120. Before considering the above question    and also the fifth grounds i.e. charge of murder, the    scope of Article 103(3) of the Constitution is also to    be considered because to decide the above the    question of facts will invariably come in.        ",
      "119. Now the question is, if the said confes-    sional statements are kept out of consideration    whether the evidence on record merely discloses a    case of conspiracy to commit mutiny to change the    then Government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman or a    conspiracy to commit murder of the President and    his family.        ",
      "118. In view of the legal position QS Stated    above, it appears that the above confessional state-    ments of Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and    Mohiuddin (Artillery) are not relevant fact to prove    the charge of conspiracy framed against the appel-    lants. As stated earlier, the first learned Judge takin g    into consideration the successive remands of the    appellants by passing the provisions of law and non    compliance of provisions of the Code of Criminal    Procedure, did not accept the confessional state.    ments holding that taking the appellants on remand    in connection with other case and “showing the    appellants arrested” without following proper pro-    cedure which according to him was a “device”    adopted by the prosecution.        ",
      "117. But however statement made after the conspiracy has been terminated on achieving its object or it is abandoned or it is frustrated or the conspirator leaves the conspiracy in between, it is not admissible against the co-conspirator. Fixing the period of conspiracy is important as the provisions of Section 10 of the evidence Act would apply only during the existence of the conspiracy.        ",
      "116. Accordingly, once a reasonable ground    exists to believe that two or more persons have    conspired together to commit an offence, anything    said, done or written by one of the conspirators in    reference to the common intention after the common    intention was entertained, is relevant against the    other, not only for the purpose of proving the exis-    tence of the conspiracy but also for proving that the    other person was a party to it. There can be two    objections to the admissibility of evidence under    section 10 of the Evidence Act, Firstly, that the co-    nsplirator whose evidence is sought to be admitted    against the coconspirator is not confronted in Court    by the co-conspirator, and secondly, the prosecution    merely proves the existence of reasonable ground t    believe that two or more Persons have conspired I    commit an offence and that brings into operation the    But however statement made after the        been terminated on Achieving it    bandoned or it is frustrated or the    conspirator leaves the conspiracy \" Mahi ig ner    admissible against the co-consp! '. IXINg the    period of conspiracy is important as PrOVisions    of section 10 of the Evidence Act would apply only    during the existence of the conspiracy.        ",
      "115. Section 10 of the Evidence Act declares    that where there is reasonable ground to band    two or more persons have conspired together to    commit an offence ’    said, done or written by any one of such persons In    reference to their common intention, after the time    when such intention was first entertained by any one    of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the    persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the    purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy    as for the purpose of showing that any such person    was 2 party to it. A plain reading of this section    makes it clear that apart from the act or statement of    the co-conspirator, some prima facie evidence must    exist of the antecedent conspiracy in order to attract    secon 10 Such evidence of a pre-existing cons-    piracy between the appellant and the two Revenue    Officers is conspicuous by its absence in this case.        ",
      "114. Similar views have been expressed in the    case of Zulfigar Ali Bhutto vs State PLD 1979 SC 53    and also in the case of State vs Nalini (1999) 5 SCC    283.In the case of Mogbool Hossain vs State, 12                      DLR SC 217 the case against Moqbool Hussain rested entirely on what the other two accused were alleged to have stated to Tahsilder at the the time of offering the bride money to the Tahsilder for the purpose of mutating his name in the register. At the trail those two accused repudiated their alleged statements.        ",
      "113. On analysing section 10, it has been    observed in Bhagwan Swarup vs State of Maha-    rashtra, AIR 1965 SC 682 as under:    <br>    “Anything so said, done or written is a rele-    vant fact only “as against each of the persons    believed to be so conspiring as well for the pur-    pose of proving the existence of the conspiracy    as for the purpose of showing that any such    person was a party to it”. It can only be used for    the purpose of proving the existence of the    conspiracy or that the other party or for the    purpose of showing that such a person was not    a party to the conspiracy. In short, the section    can be analysed as follows: (1) there shall be a    prima facie evidence affording a reasonable    ground for the Court to believe that two or more    persons are members of the conspiracy; (2) if    the said condition is fulfilled, anything said,    done or written by any one of them in reference    to their common intention will be evidence    against the other; (3) anything said, done or    written by him should have been said, done or    written by him after the intention was formed    by any one of them; (4) it would also be    relevant for the said purpose against another    who entered the conspiracy whether it was said,    done or written before he entered the conspi-    racy or after he left it; and (5) it can only be    used against a co-conspirator and not in his    favour.”        ",
      "112. As it appears the expression ‘in refer-    ence to their common intention’ is very comprehen-    sive and, it appears to have been designedly used to    give a wider scope than the words ‘in furtherance of    the common intention’ used in section 34 of the    Penal Code with the result, anything said, done or    written by a co-conspirator, after the conspiracy was    formed, will be evidence against the other before he    entered the field of conspiracy or after he left it.        ",
      "111. This point was then considered within    Mirza Akbar vs King Emperor, AIR 1940 (PC) 176.    Their Lordships of the Privy Council on conside-    ration of different authorities and section 10 of the    Evidence Act observed as follows:        “This being the principle, their Lordships    think the words of section 10 must be construed    in accordance with it and are not capable of    being widely construed so as to include a state-    ment made by one conspirator in the absence of    the other with reference to past acts done in the    actual course of carrying out the conspiracy,    after it has been completed. The common    intention is in the past. In their Lordships’ judg-    ment, the words “common intention” signifies a    common intention existing at the time when the        thing was said, done or written by one of them.    Things said, done or written while the conspi-    racy was on foot are relevant as evidence of the    common intention, once reasonable ground has    been shown to believe in its existence. But it    would be a very different matter to hold that    any narrative or statement or confession made    to a Third party after the common intention or    conspiracy was no longer operating and had    ceased to exist is admissible against the other    party. There is then no common intention of the    conspirators to which the statement can have    reference. In their Lordships’ judgment section    10 embodies this principle. That is the    construction which has been rightly applied to    section 10 in decisions in India, for instance, in    55 Bom 839 and 38 Cal 169 . In these cases the    distinction was rightly drawn between commu-    nications between conspirators while the cons-    We do not think, for a moment, of        conspiracy was going on with reference to the carry-    ing out of conspiracy and statements made,    after arrest or after the conspiracy has ended, by    way of description of events then past.”        ",
      "110. putting it any higher than the statement of an    accomplice, nor can we in any way allow ourselves    to be influenced by the statements in it, except    where those statements are corroborated by inde-    ondent testimony implicating the accused persons    in the design with which they are charged.”        ",
      "109. Inthe case of Emperor of India vs Abani    Bhusan Chakrabutty, 15 CWN 25, question arose    whether confessions of co-accuseds is a relevant    fact under section 10 of the Evidence Act. In the    above decision the Full Bench observed as follows:  <br>      “ The first piece of evidence we referred a    short time ago. It is argued, on behalf of the        Crown, that statement comes within the provi-        sions of section 10 the Indian Evidence Act, and        is therefore to be treated as evidence against        Abani’s fellow-prisoners. It is said that, if it        does not fall within section 10, at any rate,        under the provisions of section 30, it is a        confession of one of the co-accused and may be        referred to in the course of the trial. It is argued    by Mr Roy with very considerable force, that, in    any case, its value can be no higher than that of    the evidence of an accomplice, and that, indeed,    it is of less value than the evidence of an    accomplice, because an accomplice can be    cross-examined for the purpose of testing his    accuracy, while this confession of Abani made    when he was a prisoner cannot be subject to that    test. There is, of course, very great force in that    argument we have come to the conclusion that    the statement of Abani cannot properly be    treated as evidence under section 10 of the        Evidence Act, that section, in our view, 1s        intended to make evidence communications        between different conspirators while the    conspiracy is going on, with reference to the    carrying out of the conspiracy. No doubt section        10 is wider than the law of England as '0        evidence in case of conspiracy. But we do not        think that section is intended to make evidenence    the confession of a co-accused and put it on the    same footing as a communication passing    between conspirators, or between conspiration    and other persons. with reference to the                      conspiracy. But, with regard to section 30, in    our opinion the statement, being the confession    of a co-accused, can be looked at under that    section. But its value is discounted by the fact    that it cannot be tested by cross-examination,        ",
      "108. Conspiracy means something more than    the joint action of two or more persons to commit an    offence; if it were otherwise, section 10 would be    applicable to any of the offences committed by two    or more persons Jointly and would thus import into    a trial of hearsay evidence which the accused person    would find it impossible to meet. The section is        intended to admit evidence of communications    between different conspirators while the conspiracy    was going on, with reference to the carrying out of    the conspiracy. Now the question Is, whether section    10 is capable of being widely construed SO as to    include a confession made by a conspirator with    reference to past acts done in the actual course of    carrying out the conspiracy after it has been    completed.        ",
      "107. As it appears section 10 of the Evidence    Act will come into play only when the Court is    satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe    that two or more persons have conspired together to    commit an offence or an actionable wrong, that is to    say, there should be a prima facie evidence that a    person was a party to be conspiracy before his act    can be used against his conspirators. Once such a    reasonable ground exists, anything said, done or    written by one of the conspirators in reference to the    common intention, after the said intention was    entertained, is relevant against others, not only for    the purpose of proving the existence of the cons-    piracy but also for proving that the other person was    a party to it. The evidentiary value of the said act is    limited by two circumstances, namely, that the act    shall be in reference to their common intention and    in respect of a period after such period was enter-    tained by any one of them.        ",
      "106. Next question is, whether under section    10 of the Evidence Act the above confessional state-    ments even if found to be true and voluntary are    admissible in evidence against the makers and also    each of the appellants as co-conspirators to prove    the charge of criminal conspiracy after the cessation    of the conspiracy?        ",
      "105. As it appears the confessional statement    of Sultan Shahriar is about his presence in front of    Sherniabat’s house and then at the Radio Station 1st    corroborated by other two confessional statements                          of Syed Farook Rahman and Mohiuddin (artillery).    His statement as regards his subsequent conduct has    been corroborated by PWs 15, 42 and 46 . The con-    fessional statement of Farook Rahman has been    corroborated by the other two confessional state-    ments of Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (artillery).    PWs 1, 4, 11, 12, 15, 21, 42 and 46 corroborated his    statement in material particulars. The confession of    Mohiuddin (artillery) is corroborated by other con-    fessing accuseds in material particulars. His    statement has also been corroborated by PWs 17,    18, 27 and 34, His statement as regards his presence    at the night parade has been corroborated by PWs    11, 21, 22, 24, 25, 29 and 35.        ",
      "104. As to the weight of confessional state-    ment, the view of the superior Courts is that a    confession can be made foundation of a conviction    if it is recorded in accordance with law, found true    and voluntary, inculpatory in nature and if on exami-    nation of the statement as a whole if it is found in    conformity on comparison with the rest of the prose-    cution case. What amount of corroboration could be    necessary in a case would always be a question of    fact to be determined in the light of the circum-    stances of each case. Sometimes no corroborative    evidence are available and the Court can act upon    the confession whether retracted or not, against the    maker, if the confession is found to be true and    voluntary and if it was not obtained by torture,    coercion or inducement. The proper way to    approach a case of this kind is, first to marshall the    evidence against the accused excluding the confes-    sion altogether from consideration and see whether,    if it is believed, a conviction could be based on it. If    it is capable of belief independently, then, of course,    it is not necessary to call the confession in aid.    Where the Court is not prepared to act on the other    evidence, in such an event the Judge may call in aid    the confession and use it to lend assurance to the    other evidence.        ",
      "103. Similar views have been expressed in    Mohd. Hussain Umar vs KS Dalipsinghhi, AIR 1970    SC 45, Ram Prakash ys State of Punjab AIR 1959    SCI, and State vs Fazy Kazi alias Kazi Fazlur    Rahman 29 DLR (SC) 271.        ",
      "101. Regarding the effect of retraction of a    confessional statement, in the case of Joygan Bibi    12 DLR (SC)157, the Supreme Court of Pakistan    observed :        “We are unable to support the proposition    of law laid down by the learned Judges in this    regard. The retraction of a confession is a cir-    cumstance which has no bearing whatsoever    upon the question whether in the first instance it    was voluntarily made, and on the further    question whether it is true. The fact that the    maker of the confession later does not adhere to    it cannot by itself have any effect upon the    findings reached as to whether the confession    was voluntary, and if so, whether it was true, for    to withdraw from a self-accusing statement in    direct face of the consequence of the accusa-    tion, is explicable fully by the proximity of    those consequences, and need have no con-    nection whatsoever with either its voluntary    nature, or the truth of the facts stated. The    learned Judges were perfectly right in first                      deceding these two questions, and the answers    being in  the affirmative, in declaring that the    confession by itself was sufficient, taken with other facts and circumstances, to support    Abdul Majid’s conviction. The retraction of the    confession was wholly immaterial once it Was    and that it was voluntary as well as true, That    being the case, no reason Whatsoever can be    found for the inability felt by the learned Judges    is taking the confession into consideration    “against the co-accused. It is true that if there    were no other evidence against Joygun Bibi    except the confession of Abdul Majid, then, the    confession by itself being merely a matter to be    taken into consideration, and not having the    yality of evidence against Joygun Bibi, it    could rightly be held in law that her conviction    could not be sustained on the confession alone,    The grounds for this conclusion would undoub-    tedly gain weight if the confession were also    retracted. But in the present case, Abdul Majid’s    confession is by no means the only material in    the case to be taken into consideration against    Joygun Bibi. As will be seen presently, the    evidence of the maid-servant Zohura furnished    a very complete and detailed account of the    movements and behaviour of Joygun Bibi on    the night in question, and particularly at and    after the time of the murder. Joygun Bibi has    not offered any explanation in answer to the    questions put to her on the basis of Zohura’s    evidence and Abdul Majid’s confession as to    her behaviour that night. She has been content    to repeat that she is innocent and to suggest that    the case has been fabricated against her by her    husband’s younger brother, Sattar.”        DLR (SC) 598 similar views have been expressed as    follows:        “As for the confessions the High Court, it    appears, was duly conscious of the fact that    retracted confessions, whether judicial or extra-    judicial, could legally be taken into considera-    tion against the maker of those confessions    himself, and if the confessions were found to be    true and voluntary, then there was no need at all    to look for further corroboration. It is now well    Settled that as against the maker himself his        S STATE (Md Tafezzul Islam J)        33    confession, judicial Or extr    retracted or not retr    form the sole basis    Court is satisfied    and Voluntary        a-judicial, Whether    acted, can in law Validly    of his conviction, if the    and believes that it Was true        and was not obtained by torture    OF Coercion or inducement, The question, how-    ever, as to whether in the facts and circum-    stances of a given case the Court should act    upon such a confession alone is an entirely        different question, which relates to the weight        and evidentiary value of the confession and not    to its admissibility in law.”        ",
      "100. However as it appears the first learned    Judge taking into consideration the successive    remands of the appellants and the alleged non com-    pliance of provisions of law, did not accept the    confessional statements holding that taking the    appellants on remand in connection with other cases    without following proper procedure was a “device™    adopted by the prosecution for obtaining the above    confessional statements. From the record, it further    appears that Sultan Shahriar retracted his confession    on Sth February, 1997 after 52 days of his confes-    sion, Farook Rahman retracted his confession on Ist    March, 1993 after 43 days of his confession and    Mohiuddin (artillery) retracted his confession after a    long time more than 30 days of his confession.    There being no explanation on the side of defence    about the delay in filing the applications for    retractions, it can be inferred that the retracting of    these appellants are afterthought devices for nulli-    fying the admissions made in the statements.        ",
      "99. However in Kehar Singh’ case (AIR    ]988 SC 1883) a question arose about the defect in    the procedure in recording the confession of Kehar    Singh wherein it was observed as follows:        “On a consideration of the above decisions        it is manifest that if the provisions of section    164(2) which require that the Magistrate before    recording confession shall explain to the person    making confession that he is not bound to make    a confession and if he does so it may be used as    evidence against him and upon questioning the    person if the Magistrate has reasons to believe    that it is being made voluntarily then the con-    fession will be recorded by the Magistrate. The    compliance of the sub-section (2) of section 164    is therefore, mandatory and imperative and    non-compliance of it renders the confession    inadmissible in evidence. Section 463 (old    section 533 ) of the Code of Criminal Procedure    provides that where the questions and answers    regarding the confession have not been    recorded evidence can be adduced to prove that    in fact, the requirements of sub-section (2) of    section 164 read with section 28] (old section    364) have been complied with. If the Court    comes to a finding that such a compliance had    in fact, been made the mere omission to record    the same in the proper form will not render it    inadmissible evidence and the defect is cured    under section 463 but when there is no-com-    pliance of the mandatory requirement of section    164(2), Criminal Procedure Code and it comes    out in evidence that no such explanation as    envisaged in the aforesaid sub-section has been    given to the accused by the Magistrate, this    substantial defect cannot be cured under section        463 Criminal Procedure Code.”        ",
      "98. This view has been expressed in Moham-    mad Ali vs Emperor, 35 CrLJ 385 (FB) as follows:        “In view of the provisions of the sections    of the Code of Criminal Procedure, particularly    those contained in section 533, Criminal Pro-    cedure Code, it is difficult to say that the    omission to record questions and answers is a    fatal defect, and that it is only by recording such    questions and answers that a confession can    furnish data which enable the Court to arrive at    the conclusion as to the voluntary nature of the    confession. It is equally difficult to hold that    when supplying these data or materials it would    always be “impossible” for the trial Court to    form an estimate as to the voluntary nature of    such confession. The defect no doubt is a gross    irregularity and it may in certain special cases    injure the accused in his defence on the merits,    but barring such cases such a defect is    completely cured by the provisions of section    533 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is                       open to a Court to come to a conclusion from    the internal evidence furnished by the statement    itself or from other evidence that the statement    had been voluntarily made, and the mere fact    that there was an omission to record questions    and answers would not debar the Court from    coming to that conclusion. Nor can it be said    that without these data or materials it is “impos-    sible” for a Court to arrive at the conclusion that    the confession had been made voluntarily.    Where, of course, the defect is not merely one    of recording it in due form and in accordance    with law but there is a defect that the statement    was not duly made at all, the position would be    different.”        ",
      "97. ‘This section provides a mode for the    rectification of an error arising from noncompliance    with any of the provisions of section 164 or section    364, The object is to prevent justice being frustrated    by reason of such non-compliance, If any of the    provisions of this section have not been complied    with by a Magistrate, the confessional statement    may be admitted under this section upon taking    evidence that the statement recorded was duly made,    if non-compliance has not injured the accused to his    defence on the merit. If the record of the confession    or the statement is inadmissible owing to the failure    to comply with any of the provisions of section 164    or section 364, intrinsic evidence, notwithstanding    anything in section 91 of the Evidence Act, may be    given to show that the accused person duly made the    statement and the statement, when so proved may be    admitted and used as evidence of the case, if non-    compliance has not injured the accused. The non-    compliance with the provisions is cured only when    there is no injury caused to the accused as to his    defence on merit.        ",
      "96. Section 533 reads as follows:    <br>    “533 . Non-compliance with provisions of    section 164 or 364(1)—If any Court, before    which a confession or other statement of an    accused person recorded or purporting to be    recorded under section 164 or section 364 is    tendered or has been received in evidence, finds    that any of the provisions of either of such    sections have not been complied with by the    Magistrate recording the statement, it shall take    evidence that such person duly made the    statement recorded; and, notwithstanding any-    thing contained in the Evidence Act, 1872,    section 91, such statement shall be admitted if    the error has not injured the accused as to his    defence on the merits.    <br>    (2) The provisions of this section apply to    Courts of Appeal, Reference and Revision.”        ",
      "95. In the instant particular case only section    533 of the Code is to be considered. The first lear-    ned Judge has mentioned section 537 of the Code in    this regard which has no manner of application in    respect of any error or omission or irregularities that    occurred while recording confessional statement by    Magistrate.        ",
      "94. Chapter XLV of the Code of Criminal    Procedure deals generally with the irregular    proceedings. There are certain irregularities which    do not vitiate the proceedings and these are set out    in section 529, No question of prejudice arises in    this class of cases because the section states cate-    gorically that they shall not vitiate the proceedings.    Certain other irregularities are treated as vital and        there the proceedings are void irrespective of        prejudice. These are set out in section 530 . A Third    class is dealt with in sections $31, 532, 533, 535,    §36(2) and $37 . There broadly speaking the ques-    tion is, Whether the error has caused prejudice to the    accused or has occasioned a failure of justice. The    Code has carefully classified certain kinds of error    and expressly indicates how they have to be dealt    with. In every such case the Court is bound to give    effect to the express commands of the legislature,    there is no scope for further speculation. The only    class of case in which the Courts are free to reach a    decision is that for which no express provision is    made.        ",
      "93. As it appears the object of putting ques-    tions to an accused who offers to confess is to obtain    an assurance of the fact that the confession is not    caused by any inducement, threat or promise having    reference to the charge against him.                      ",
      "92. PW S2 stated that at the time of recor-    ding confession of Mohiuddin (Artillery) he fol-    lowed the procedures provided in section 364 of the    Code and thereafter he issued a certificate and that    after recording his confession, the accused was sent    to jail custody. Mohiuddin (Artillery) also dig Ney    challenge the claim of this witness about FeCordin,    his statement in accordance with the procedure laiq    down by law. PW 52 however, admitted that 1p,    Column No.1 of the Form was blank pw 52    however denied the defence suggestion that Mofy.    uddin (Artillery)did not make any confession to him    or that he signed a statement being prepared by th.    investigating officer or that the signature of thi,    accused was obtained by force in presence of the    police and that the confessional statements were nos    true or voluntary. As it appears in column No.1 o¢    the Form it was mentioned by PW 52 that the Moki.    uddin was produced at 11-00 AM on 271    November, 1996 and his statement was recorded a1    2-00 PM. So the time as well as date of producing    the accused and the time of recording his statement    were duly mentioned. Column Nos. 3 and 4 of the    Form are the instructions and guidelines given to the    Magistrates to follow while recording confessional    statement of an accused. Column No.3 relates to    explaining to the confessing accused each of the    matters mentioned in column 5 and to caution him    to reflect carefully before making the statement.    However, as it appears, the queries required to    confront the accused in column 5 had duly been    confronted in Column No. 6 . The above columns    were duly filled up and so the accused should not    have any grievance in this regard. The defence    suggestion that at the time of recording statement    any police officer was present in his room was    denied Column 8 relates to brief statement of    Magistrate’s reasoning about his satisfaction that the    statement was voluntary. The concerned Magistrate    in his statement stated that the confessional    statement was recorded in accordance with law and    that the accused being satisfied of the correctness of    the statement put his signature. Column 10 contains    the time of forwarding the accused after recording    confession. The concerned Magistrate stated that    after recording statement he forwarded the accused    to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on the same        day with the record.        ",
      "91. PW SI stated that he recorded the con-    fession of Sultan Shahriar after compliance of    formalities required under section 364 of the Code    of Criminal Procedure and explained to the accused    about the contents of his statement and that after    recording statement he issued a certificate about the    correctness of the statement. As it appears appellant    Sultan Shahriar did not challenge this statement of    this witness that he did record his statement in    accordance with section 364 of the Code. PW 51    however admitted that there was no comment in    column No.S of the Form and he gave an explana-    tion that as the accused did not complain to him of    any il] treatment he did not fill up the above column    and this witness denied the defence suggestion that    he recorded the statement of the accused under    duress and torture and that the accused was kept in    wrongful confinement in police custody or that the    statement recorded was not read over to the accused    and that it was not voluntary. PW 51 also stated that        e recorded the statement of Farook Rahman after    compliance of the formalities required under section    364 of the Code and that after recording his    confession the accused was sent to the Court of    Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and the CMM    acknowledged the receipt of the accused on the    same day and that he issued a certificate to the above    effect. Farook Rahman the confessing accused, did    not challenge this claim made by this witness    regarding the recording of his confessional state-    ment in accordance with the provisions required by    law. PW 51 denied the defence suggestion that at the    time of recording his statement an ASP of CID the    investigating officer and other police officers were    present in his room. PW 51 however admitted that    he did not fill up columns 3, 4, 8 and 10 of the Form    but denied the defence suggestion that Faruque    Rahman reported to him about police torture.        ",
      "90. Records show that Sultan Shahriar was    shown arrested in the instant case on 3rd October,    1996 and he was taken on police remand for 7 days    on 30th November, 1996 and then his confessional    statement was recorded and that Farook Rahman    was shown arrested on 3rd October, 1996 in the    instant case and thereafter he was taken on police    remand for 7 days on 12th December, 1996 and then    his confessional statement was recorded on 19th                      December, 1996 and that Mohiuddin (artillery) was    taken on police remand for 7 days on 19th Novem-    ber, 1996 and thereafter he made his confessional    statement on 27th November, 1996.        ",
      "89. Mr Anisul Huq and the learned Attorney-    General, on the other hand, submitted that the first    learned Judge not only misread the materials on    record, but on misconception of law disbelieved the    above confessional statements on the grounds that    before recording the statements the confessing    accuseds were kept in police remand beyond period    as provided in section 167(2) of the Code of Crimi-    nal Procedure by a “device”. The learned Attorney-    General drew our attention to the statement of PW    61 and submitted that the appellant Farook Rahman    was taken on police remand for 13 days on two    occasions in Lalbagh PS Case No.11(11)75 before    the institution of the instant case on 2nd October    1996, and Sultan Shahrior was also taken on 15 days    remand on three occasions in the said case before he    was shown arrested in the instant case on 3rd    October 1996 and accordingly, findings of the first    learned Judge that the confessional statement of    Farook Rahman was in fact, recorded after keeping    him on police remand for 32 days and likewise the    confessional statement of Shahriar was recorded    after keeping him on police remand for 34 days are    not correct.        ",
      "88. Regarding the confessional statements of    the appellants Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and    Mohiuddin (Artillery), the learned Counsel for the    appellants submitted those were procured by torture    and coercion by the police by keeping them on    police remand for a long time and therefore, those    were not voluntary as would be evident from the    reasonings and findings given by first learned Judge    and the second learned Judges erred in law in    accepting these confessions as voluntary and the    Third learned Judge also erred in accepting the    confession of Mohiuddin (Artillery). It was further    urged that since the learned Judges of the Division    Bench were equally divided in their opinion as    regards the confessional statements of Sultan Shah-    riar, Farook Rahman, the Third learned Judge ought    to have considered their confessional statements    also.        ",
      "87. Before discussing the fourth and fifth    grounds i.e. conspiracy and murder, the question as    to whether the confessions made by the appellants    Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin    (Artillery) are legally admissible in evidence are to    be addressed because if those confessional state-    ments are legally admissible in evidence, the state-    ment made therein will be relevant for disposing    both the grounds of conspiracy as well as murder    and if those are found to be not legally admissible,        the prosecution wil] have to prove both the grounds    on the basis of other evidence on record,        ",
      "86. It also appears that in order to avoid con-    troversy, the leamed Sessions Judge was accorded    sanction from the prescribed authority for trial of the    appellants and other accused persons although they    have committed no offence under the Army Act.    Therefore, I find no substance in the objection raised    by the learned Counsels for the appellants regarding    the forum of trial.        ",
      "85. As it appears in the instant appeals there    is nothing on record to show that the army authority    have initiated any proceeding against the appellants    and other accused persons under the Army Act for    violating the direction of the authority. There is also    no evidence that there was collective insubordina-    tion when they committed the killing, The accused    persons were not in ‘active service’ and they have    not committed a civil offence within the meaning of    section §(2) of the Army Act. Therefore, the cri-    minal Court has not acted in excess of jurisdiction in    convicting the appellants.        ",
      "84. As it appears, in the above case, the    appellants were convicted by a General Court Mar-    tial held at Nicosia in Cyprus of the offences of    mutiny. On the night of the incident a noisy outbreak    took place in the barracks—the appellants held a    meeting on the roof of the hotel at which they were    stationed, then came down and acted in riotous    conduct and demolished the barrack’s shop as their    grievances made to the authority were not redressed.    They received an order from a Warrant Officer to    disperse but they did not disperse. The House of    Lords refused to interfere with their conviction on    the reasonings as under:        “I have not thought it necessary to take up    time by going through the evidence in detail.    The Court is quite satisfied that there was    evidence on which the Court Martial could find    on a proper direction that there was a mutiny,    and it is not for us to criticize the finding    provided there was evidence on which they    could come to the decision they did. For the                      reasons which I have endeavoured to state as    shortly as 1 can, the Court is of opinion that    there was no misdirection; that, although per-    haps criticism could be made of the words the    Judge-Advocate used when he made his    interlocutory observation, there was a perfectly    fair direction and nothing was said by the    Judge-Advocate which could have misled the    Court Martial. Therefore, on all these grounds    the appeals should, we think, be dismissed,”        ",
      "83. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the learned    Counsel for the appellant Bazlul Huda, however    referred the case of RV Grant, Davis Riley and    Topley, (1957) 2 All ER 694.        ",
      "82. As it appears, this case has no manner of    application in the facts and circumstances of the    instant case.        ",
      "81. In the case of Jamil Huq relied on by the    appellants, the writ petitioners were tried and    convicted by the Court Martial under the Army Act    1952 for the offence of mutiny that took place in the    night following 29th March, 1981 which resulted in    the death of Ziaur Rahman, the then President of    Bangladesh. They filed writ petitions challenging    the decision of the Court Martial constituted under,    the Army Act. The High Court summarily rejected    the writ petitions. The Appellate Division in the    facts of the given case observed “if the Court Mar-    tial is constituted properly and the offence commit-    ted is cognizable by it then the rest is a question of    fact based on evidence which is held by all the    authorities that the writ jurisdiction is not available    to interfere. This Court is only concerned to    examine the question whether the jurisdiction under    Article 102 has been conferred and once it comes to    the conclusion that the jurisdiction has not been    conferred there is the end of the matter.”        ",
      "80. In the case of Major EG Barsay vs State    of Bombay, AIR 1961 SC 1762 it was observed by    Subha Rao, J as follows:        “The scheme of the Act therefore is self-    evident. It applies to offences committed by    army personnel described in section 2 of the    Act; it creates new offences with specified    punishments, imposes higher punishments to    preexisting offences, and enables civil offences    by a fiction to be treated as offence under the    Act; it provides satisfactory machinery for    resolving the conflict of jurisdiction. Further it    enables, subject to certain conditions an    accused to be tried successively both by Court    Martial and by a criminal Court. It does not    expressly bar the jurisdiction of criminal Courts    in respect of acts or omissions punishable under    the Act, if they are also punishable under any    other law in force in India; nor is it possible to    infer any prohibition by necessary implication,    Sections 125, 126 and 127 exclude any such    inference, they, in express terms, provide not    only for resolving conflict of jurisdiction bet-    ween a criminal Court.and a Court Martial in    respect of a same offence, but also provide for    successive trials of an accused in respect of the    same offence.”        ",
      "79. In Joginder Singh vs State of Himachal    Pradesh, AIR 1971 SC 500, the Supreme Court    observed:        “It is further clear that in respect of an    offence which could be tried both by a criminal    Court as well as a Court Martial, sections 125,    126 and the Rules have made suitable provi-    sions to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction between    the ordinary criminal Courts and the Court    Martial, But it is to be noted that in the first    instance, discretion is left to the officer men-    tioned in section 125 to decide before which                       Court the proceedings should be instituted.    Hence the officer commanding the army, army    corps, division or independent brigade in which    the accused person is serving or such other    officer as may be prescribed will have to    exercise his discretion and decide under section    125 in which Court the proceedings shall be    instituted. It is only when he so exercises his    discretion and decides that the proceeding    should be instituted before a Court Martial, that    the provisions of section 126(1) come into    operation. If the designated officer does not    exercise his discretion and decides that the pro-    ceedings should be instituted before a Court    Martial, the Army Act would not obviously be    in the way of a criminal Court exercising its    ordinary jurisdiction in the manner provided by    law.”        ",
      "78. In Balbir Singh vs State of Punjab    (1995) 1 SCC 90 the Supreme Court of India obser-    ved:        “When a criminal Court and Court Martial    each have jurisdiction in respect of the trial of    the offence, it shall be in the discretion of the    officer commanding the group, wing or station    in which the accused is serving or such other    officer as may be prescribed, in the first    instance, to decide before which Court the pro-    ceedings shall be instituted and if that officer    decides that they should be instituted before a    “Court Martial”, to direct that the accused    persons shall be detained in Air Force custody.    Thus, the option to try a person subject to the    Air Force Act who commits an offence while on    “active service” is in the first instance with the    Air Force Authorities. The criminal Court,    when such an accused is brought before it shall    not proceed to try such a person or to inquire    with a view to his commitment for trial and    shall give a notice to the Commanding Officer    of the accused, to decide whether they would    like to try the accused by a Court Martial or    allow the criminal Court to proceed with the    trial. In case, the Air Force Authorities decide    either not to try such a person by a Court    Martial or fail to exercise the option when    intimated by a criminal Court within the period    prescribed by Rule 4 of the 1952 Rules, the    accused can be tried by the ordinary criminal    Court in accordance with the Code of Criminal    Procedure.”        ",
      "77. It may be mentioned here that sections    125 and 126 of the Army Act 1950 as applicable to        MAJOR BAZLUL Hupa vg State (Md Tafeezl Islam J) 27        India and sections 94 and 95 of the Army Act, 1952    are in verbatim language.        ",
      "16. Section 139 of the Penal Code is inclu-    ded in chapter VII Which contains sections 131-140.    it appears section 131 provides for abetting    mutiny OF attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or    airman from his duty, section 132 provides for abet-    ment of mutiny, if mutiny is committed in conse-    quence thereot and other Sections are relating to    abetment of other offences and section 139 prohibits    unishment of any person under the provisions of    penal Code who is subject to the Army Act, 1952,    the Navy Ordinance, 1961, the Air Force Act 1953    for any of the offences or the abetment of those    offences mentioned in sections 131 to 138 . Thus    section 139 of the Penal Code has no application in    the present appeals in view of the fact that the    appellants have been tried and convicted not for    committing an offence of abetment of mutiny but for    substantive offences of criminal conspiracy and    murder. Regarding section 549 of the Code, it    appears that it is of a special nature and has the    result of taking away the jurisdiction of criminal    Court with respect to persons subject to military,    naval and air force law. The expressions “‘is liable to    be tried either by a Court to which this Code applies    or by a Court Martial” used in this section implies    that the offence for which the offender is to be tried    should be an offence of which cognizance can be    taken by a Criminal Court as well as a Court Mar-    tial. The phrase is intended to refer to the initial    jurisdiction of the two Courts to take cognizance of    the offence and not to their jurisdiction to decide it    on merits. In respect of offences which could be    tried by both the Criminal Court as well as a Court    Martial, sections 94 and 95 of the Army Act have    made suitable provisions to avoid a conflict of        jurisdiction between those two Courts as discussed    above.        ",
      "75. The learned Counsels for the appellants    also contended that in view of section 139 of the    penal Code and section 549 of the Code of Criminal    procedure the trial of the appellants by a criminal    Court 1st barred.        ",
      "74. [am also in agreement with the submis-    sion of Mr Tawfique Nawaz that in view of the position                       of the then President as provided in the Cons.    jitution, merely because of one single Act i.e. Army    Act 1952, and for being “commander in chief” the    late president cannot be regarded as army personnel,        ",
      "73.  In terms of the relevant provisions of law    as above, if the appellants being not in ‘active    service’ commit a ‘civil offence’, the provisions of    Army Act does not stand on the way for their trial by    a criminal Court. Further sections 94 and 95 have    also been included in chapter IX of the Army Act    1952 for trial of ‘civil offence’ by an ordinary    criminal Court. Section 94 presupposes that both a    criminal Court and Court Martial have jurisdiction    concurrently in respect of an act or omission punish-    able both under the Army Act or in case of an    offence deemed to be an offence under the Army Act    as well as under any law in force and the same will    also be under scheme of those two provisions, in the    first instance, it is left to the discretion of the    prescribed officer to decide before which Court the    proceedings shall be instituted and, if the prescribed    officer decides that the case should be instituted    before a Court Martial, the offender is to be detained    in military ‘custody. However, at the same time if a    criminal Court is of opinion that the said offence    shall be tried before the said Court, he may issue    notice under section 95 either to deliver over the    offender to the nearest Magistrate or to postpone the    proceedings pending a reference to the Government    and upon receipt of the requisition the prescribed    officer may either deliver over the offender to the    said Court or refer the question to the Government    for determination as to whose order shall be final.        ",
      "71. The term ‘active service’ has been    defined in section 8(1) as under:        “active service”, as applied to a person    subject to this Act, means the time during which    such person is attached to, or forms part of a    force which is engaged in operations against an    enemy, or is engaged in military operations in,        vs STATE (Md Tafa Islam J        on the line of march to a country or place    wholly or partly occupied by an enemy, or    attached to or forms part of a force which is in military occupation of a foreign country:        or        There is no allegation against the appel-    accused persons to the effect that    while they were in “active service” committed the    offence of murder and the appellants also did not    claim that the incident was committed while they    were on “active service”. There is also no material    on record to show that the incident was committed    while the appellants were engaged in operation    against an enemy OF that they were engaged in    military operation or on the line of march to a    country or place wholly or partly occupied by an    enemy.    ",
      "70. As it appears section 59(1) of the Army    Act 1952 provides that subject to the provisions of    sub-section (2), any person subject to the Army Act    who at any place commits a civil offence shall be    deemed to be guilty of an offence under the Army    Act and “Civil offence’ defined in section 8(2) Army    Act means an offence which, if committed in Bangla-    desh, would be triable by a criminal Court. There-    fore, there is no dispute that if the acts of the    appellants come within the mischief of ‘civil    offence’ there is no legal bar for the trial of the    appellants by a criminal Court constituted under the    Code however, section 59(2) of the Army Act    stipulates that person who is subject to Army Act    commits murder against any person not subject to    the Army Act shall not be liable to prosecution    under the Army Act unless he commits the offence    while on active service.        ",
      "35. In this Ordinance, mutiny means a    combination between two or more persons    subject to service law, or between persons two    at least of whom are subject to service law—    <br>    (a) to overthrow or resist lawful authority    in the armed forces of Bangladesh or any forces    co-operating therewith or in any part of any of    the said forces;    <br>    (b) to disobey such authority in such cir-    cumstances as to make the disobedience sub-    versive of discipline, or with the object of    avoiding any duty or service, or in connection    with operations against the enemy; or    <br>    (c) to impede the performance of any duty    or service in the armed forces of Bangladesh or    in any forces co-operating therewith, or in any    part of any of the said forces.”    <br>    There is no dispute that this definition of    mutiny is applicable in the Army Act, 1952 in view    of the definition of ‘service law’ given in section    4(xxxiv), of the Navy Ordinance, 1961 which    provides that “service law” means this Ordinance,    the Army Act, 1952, the Air Force Act, 1953, and the    rules and regulations made thereunder.              ",
      "67. By the above suggestions as given to the    witnesses the appellants termed the incident as a    successful military coup d’etat and that the Govern-    ments protected and rewarded them by declaring    them as ‘Surya Santan’ and the appellants did not try    to make out a case of mutiny and further they, in    their statements under section 342, were conspi-    cuously silent on this point and they changed their    stand at the appellate stage in the High Court    Division although there is no material in support of    the plea. Though in the Army Act, 1952, the defi-    nition of mutiny has not been given but the    punishment for the mutiny has been provided in    section 31 of the Army Act 1952 . Mutiny has been    defined in section 35 of the Navy Ordinance, 1961,    which reads thus :        ",
      "66. However, as it appears as per provisions    of the Constitution, after the killing of the President,    the then Vice-President ought to have assumed the    office as President but this time this constitutional        rovisions were ignored. Further, if there was a    mutiny, the officers and jawans involved in the    incident should have been put on trial for mutiny    under the Army Act by the Government in power    but no such action was taken, rather the killers were    rewarded by the Government. Md Reajul Haque    Pw 37), a employee of Radio Station, stated in    chief that at about 9-00 AM the chiefs of three    services aS well as the BDR chief and the IGP of    Police were brought by Major Dalim at Studio No.2    and their statements of allegiance in favour of the    change were recorded and broadcast. On behalf of    Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid it was    suggested to Major General Shafiullah (PW 45) that    there was a successful military insurrection in the    morming of 15th August, 1975 and in the said    insurrection Khondker Mustaque Ahmed assumed    the power of President, that all the chiefs of the    defence services expressed their allegiance and that    he did not take any action against the persons    involved in the incident and that Khandaker    Mustague declared the killers as ‘7 a1”. In reply    to a question on behalf of Farook Rahman, Colonel    Shafayet Jamil (PW 44) stated that it was not    possible to take any action against the killers of 15th    August as the persons involved in the killing of 15th    August were given protection by the subsequent    Governments and favoured them and that the    conspirators and killers of 15th August used to stay    at Bangabhaban and that they run the Mustaque    Government by constituting a Revolutionary    Council.        ",
      "65. As it appears the defence did not take    any plea of “mutiny” while cross-examining or    giving suggestions to the prosecution witnesses.    Since the prosecution witnesses did not say anything    in support of the defence plea of mutiny, the defence    ought to have suggested to the prosecution witnes-    ses that the involved officers and jawans in the    mutiny submitted their charter of demands and as    their demands were not acceded to, they killed the    President but on the contrary it was suggested to PW    24 on behalf of Lieutenant Colonel Syed Farook    Rahman that at that time when Major Dalim was    broadcasting the news of the killing, PW 24, had    knowledge about declaration of Martial Law and                      that Khondker Mustaque Ahmed became the Chief    Martial Law Administrator. From this suggestion    the defence Wanted to make out a case that after the    killing of the President, Martial Law was declared    ; Khondker Mustaque Ahmed became the Presi-    dent and the Chief Martial Law Administrator of the    country and by this suggestion the defence wanted    to make out a case that since the killing was the    consequence of a successfull army insurrection, such    killing would not constitute an offence of murder.        ",
      "64. Mr Tawfique Nawaz, the learned Coun-    sel for the State, submitted that the entire scheme of    the constitutional and legal personality of the Presi-    dent as was provided in some 59 Articles of the    Constitution which were in force at the time of the    killing of the then President are very explicit and    accordingly, the legal personality and the status,    functions and immunities as enjoyed by the then    President under the Constitution is to be considered    on the basis of constitutional provisions instead of    merely considering his position merely on the basis    of one single Act i.e. Army Act 1952 or a provision    therein for treating him as “army personnel” for    being the “commander in chief” and accordingly the    trial of the appellants by criminal Court instead of    Court Martial was lawful.        ",
      "63. Mr Anisul Hug, on the other hand, con-    tended that the incident is not a mutiny, rather it is a    preplanned murder and therefore, there is no legal    bar for the trial of the appellants under the provi-    sions of the Code of Criminal Procedure as would        Mason Bazin Huns vs STATE (Md Teferced Islam J)        appear from the provisions of sections 59, 92, 94    and 95 of the Army Act 1952, section 35 of the Navy    Ordinance 1961 and section 549 of the Code of C53.    minal Procedure. Learned Attorney-General endor.    sing the above submissions of Mr Hug added thay    the appellants did not raise this point in the triay    Court and raised it for the first time in the High    Court Division with malafide motive in order to    confuse the Court and further the evidence on record    do not support a case of mutiny and rather disclosed    a case of murder and accordingly, charges against    the appellants were duly framed and even if it is    assumed the incident is a ‘civil offence’ within the    meaning of section 8(2) read with section 59(2) of    the Army Act, in view of section 94 of the Army Act    the Criminal Court has concurrent jurisdiction to try    such offence.        ",
      "62. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman further submit-    ted that the instant incident originated from Dhaka    Cantonment on the night of 14th August from which    it is apparent that it was a mutiny simpliciter and    further there was also no agreement or criminal cons-        piracy or premeditated plan or pre-arranged plan,    within the meaning of section 34 or section 120A of        the Penal Code. The learned Counsel further argued    even if when any retired army officer or any other    person not subject to Army Act joined in the    occurrence on the night following 14th August,    1975 would also constitute a mutiny within the    ambit of section 31 of the Army Act and accord-    ingly, they also ought to have been tried by a Court    Martial under the Army Act and moreover, there is    similarity in the killings of the President as in the    present appeals and General Ziaur Rahman as in    hoth the cases they were Presidents of the Republic    and they were killed by the army personnel and in    the present appeals the officers and jawans army    from artillery and lancer units came out from Dhaka    Cantonment and killed the President at dawn on    15th August, 1975 at his official residence, whereas,    in case of Genera] Ziaur Rahman the army came out    from Chittagong Cantonment and killed him at Cir-    cuit House where he was staying on the night    following 29th May, 1981 and since both the occur-    rences were committed in similar manner, the    appellants, if they were at all involved in the    incident of 15th August, ought to have been tried by    a Court-Martial as was done in case of General    Ziaur Rahman. Further, the President, being the    commander-in-chief of the armed forces, for his    killing, trial ought to have been held before Court    Martial. In support of this contention the learned    Counsel has referred the case of Jamil Huq vs        Bangladesh, 34 DLR (SC) 125.        ",
      "61. Solam of the view that the delay being    reasonably explained, no interference is called from    this Division. Regarding the Third ground, i.e.    Mutiny, the leamed Counsels for the appellants    made common submission that the evidence on    record revealed that the killing of the President and    the members of his family and the change of power    on 15th August, 1975 was a result of mutiny by    some army officers and therefore the trial ought to    have been held by Court Martial under the    provisions of Army Act, 1952 and accordingly the    trial of the appellants under the provision of the    Code of Criminal Procedure was without juridiction                       and in support of this submission sections    31(a), 59(3), 92(2), 94 and 95 of the Army Act,    sections § and 139 of the Penal Code and section    594(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure were    referred.        ",
      "60. It seems to me the learned Judges have    given cogent reasons in believing the explanation of    delay given by the prosecution. Further this being a    finding of fact based on evidence on record, the    scope of this Division to interfere under Article    103(3) of the Constitution is very limited.        ",
      "59. The criminal justice system in a country    is designed to protect the citizens of the country    from the onslaught of criminal activities of a section    of people who indulges in such acts. State as a    guardian of fundamental rights of its citizens is duty    bound to ensure the administration of justice and the    rule of law. It is in the interest of the people that the    guilt of the offender who has indulged in criminal    activity is determined as quickly as possible. But,    unfortunately, this concept has been ignored after    killing of the then President of the country and other    members of his family. In order to have a strong    socio-economic system, it is important that each and    every offender involved in crime should be put to    justice and his trial should move at reasonably fast    pace. The challenges before the criminal justice    system are to balance the rights of the citizen as well    as of the accused while dispensing speedy and    effective justice in order to ensure a welfare state for    its citizens. Rule of law is meaningless unless there    is access to justice for the common people.        ",
      "58. The above submissions have substance    as justice is related to law and justice differs from    benevolence, generosity, gratitude, friendship and    compassion and justice consists of maintaining the    societal sfatus quo and further the concept of    impartiality is at the core of the system of criminal    justice. Further, a Government is not of men but of    laws. When law ends tyranny begins. Law is the    very antithesis of arbitrary power. Further, among    different types of felonies, an offence of murder or    an order to commit murder is obviously illegal and    immoral and that is why the Nazis never tried to    legalise genocide and the orders to kill the concen-    tration camp inmates were always couched in veiled    terms and even the Nazis recognised that such    conduct could never be justified in terms of any    system of law.        ",
      "57. The leamed Attorney-General and Mr    Azmalul Hossain expressing their concern about the    mode of dispensation of justice by the then Govern-    ments in power submitted that the justice delivery    system has failed in all respects during the relevant    time which cannot be exonerated and this failure of    the justice delivery system has colossal and    catastrophic affect in the country which should not    be allowed to recur for the interest of the country.    This, according Mr Hossain, is a part of the history    that cannot be erased—the entire administration,    from top to the bottom, failed to perform their res-    ponsibilities which will be termed as a scandalous    chapter in our history and this sort of practice should        be stopped forever and it should not be allowed to    repeat again.        ",
      "56. Further as the law stands, if no case was    instituted against the killers of the elected President    of the country by anyone on behalf of the victims,    the Government “according to law” was under obli-    gations to institute a case, specially when an elected    President was brutally killed along with his family    and further, the appellants along with other accuseds    not only committed an offence of murder, they also    committed atrocities against humanity by killing a    child and three innocent women. Further, the above    offence of murder being a cognizable offence, if no    FIR was lodged on behalf of the victims for such an    offence, the officer-in-charge of the Dhanmondi    Police Station was under an obligation to hold    investigation into the offence without an order of a    Magistrate and to submit his report under section    173 of the Code.        ",
      "55. Admittedly, the then President and all    other members of his family found in the house    were brutally killed. Had the Government in power    had not supported the above killing, it was the    bounden duty of the Governments in power 10    institute a case for ascertaining the cause for the    death and bring the killers to justice but, in this    particular case, the process of law has not been    allowed to take its own course, rather by promul-    gating Indemnity Ordinance 1975 the Government    in power wanted to protect the accuseds including        |                      the appellants and further, though some of them    were initially removed army officers, they were also    absorbed in the Foreign Ministry and were    appointed in the Foreign Missions.        ",
      "54. Further, as Lieutenant Colonel Shafayat    Jamil (PW 44) stated in his deposition, the appellant    Farook Rahman and condemned convict Major    Rashid always stayed in the Bangabhaban and their    accomplice officers stayed in the Radio Station and    used to maintain contact among them by constitu-    ting an unwritten Revolutionary Command Council    and ruled the country under the leadership of    Khondker Mustaque Ahmed and that it was not    possible for taking legal action against the killers of    15th August as the killers were being given    protection by the Governments in power after the        incident till 1996.        ",
      "53. Further, as it appears, after the incident    Khondker Mustaque Ahmed usurped the power and    proclaimed Martial Law on 20th August, 1975 and    assumed the office of the President of Bangladesh    with retrospective effect from 15th August, 1975    and then he promulgated the Indemnity Ordinance,    1975 on 26th September, 1975 putting restriction on    taking of any legal or other proceedings against    persons in respect of certain acts, things, committed    by those persons in connection with, or in prepa-    ration or execution of any plan for, or necessary    steps towards the change of the Government of    Bangladesh. As it appears whether or not an FIR    could have been lodged even after the promulgation    of the said Ordinance was a matter of interpretation    of law and further the above Ordinance has also        made psychological impact.        ",
      "52. In the present case the informant in the    FIR has implicated only 14 accused persons in the    FIR and out of them he made specific allegation of    overt act only against Bazlul Huda and identified    three other accused persons and implicated rest of    the accused persons from the informations collected        from other sources. If the informant had il] motive to    implicate and/or embellish facts against the appel-    lants and other accused persons, he could have    vividly mentioned in the FIR the role played by each    accused person, but he did not resort to that path and this shows that this FIR is the true version what the informant has seen at the place of occurrence ang    whatever evidence that have been collected againt,    the appellants and other accused persons about their    complicity by the investigating agency were in the    course of the investigation of the case.        ",
      "51. However, as observed in the case of    Shreekantthia (supra) the delay in lodging the first    information report puts the Court on guard to search    for and consider if any explanation has been offered    for the delay. Once it is offered, the Court is to only    see whether it is satisfactory or not. In case the    prosecution fails to explain the delay satisfactorily    and there is possibility of embellishment or    exaggeration in the prosecution version on account    of such delay then this possibility becomes a rele-    vant factor. On the other hand, satisfactory expla-    nation of the delay is enough to reject the plea of    false implication or vulnerability of the prosecution    case.        ",
      "50. It is true delay in lodging the FIR some-    times results to embellishment by creature of after-    thoughts. But the consistent views of the Superior    Courts are that mere delay in lodging a case is not a    cround for disbelieving a prosecution case, for there    are various circumstances in which lodging any case        as to the commission of offence may be delayed.        ",
      "48. The second learned Judge observed:    <br>    “In this case from the evidence of PW 44    and other witnesses, the most accused persons    used to stay in Banga Bhaban since 15th    August, 1975 and in the name of an unwritten    command council used to govern the country    till they were made to leave on the 4th Novem-    ber, 1975 . Still though they were not without    influence. The accused Major Syed Farook    Rahman tried to force a mutiny at Savar and    Bogra Cantonments and the accused Major    Khondker Abdur Rashid tried unsuccessfully to    take over the command of 2nd Field Artillery    Regiment in 1976, Again in 1980 they made    another attempt to overthrow the Government    but still no Government took any punitive    action against any of them; rather they were all    given their arrear salaries. The accused Major                       Syed Farook Rahman even contested the Pre-    sidential election in 1986 (PW 44), So the appre    hension of the informant about his life and limb    cannot be said to be unreasonable. Under such    circumstances, the delay in lodging the PIR    cannot vitiate the trial, after all it is always for    prove its case on evidence, as the prosecution to    Counsel such, and the contention of the learned    on behalf of the appellants about the delay in        lodging the FIR has got no substance.”                ",
      "47. The first learned Judge observed:        “In the present case delay in lodging the    FIR has sufficiently been explained and in view    of the matter the contention that FIR has been    lodged after lapse of several years change of    manipulation and false implication can all    together to be not ruled out merits no consi-    deration.”        ",
      "46. Mr Anisul Huq, and the learned Attor-    ney-General, on the other hand, submitted that the    prosecution not only had explained the reasons but    qalso demonstrated cogent evidence to substantiate    WNthe cause for delay in lodging the FIR and the    inability of the informant to lodge the FIR after the    <occurrence due to the fact that the successive    op Governments expressly as well as impliedly pre-    vented the institution of the case against the appel-    lants and other accused persons by promulgating    Indemnity Ordinance 1975 and protected the    appellants and other accuseds persons as would be    evident from the fact that after the incidents the    appellants and other accuseds not only remained    under the shelter of the then governments but also    held influential and powerful positions and Major    Rashid contested the general election in 1996 who    along with Farook Rahman floated a political party    under the name “Freedom Party” and Farook    Rahman also contested the election in 1980, and    Bazlul Huda was the Secretary of the “Freedom    Party” and further after General Ziaur Rahman came    to power he rewarded most of the accused persons        21 involved in the killing of the President and his        family by appointing them in foreign missions, even        they openly declared themselves as killers of the        then President and his family and that this being an        exceptional case in which then successive Govern-        ments sheltered and protected the accused persons        including the appellants, the informant was    apprehensive of his life by taking risk of filing any    case till the Bangladesh Awami League came into    power in the year 1996 . In support of the above    submissions the learned Counsels for the State    referred the cases of State vs Fazal, 39 DLR (AD)    166, Md Shamsuddin @ Lalu vs State, 40 DLR (AD)    69, Tara Singh vs State of Punjab 1991 Supp (1)    SCC 536, Jamna vs State of UP 1994 Supp(1) SCC    185 and State of HP vs Shreekanthia Shekari (2004)    8 SCC 153 . As it appears the learned Judges of the    High Court Division believed the explanation for    delay and observed that the prosecution has been    able to explain the delay by assigning cogent reason.        ",
      "45. Lamof the view that the above judgment    and order of the Third learned Judge is absolutely in    accordance with the provision of sections 378 and    429 of the Code. Regarding the second ground i.e.    delay, the leamed Counsels for the appellants    submitted that there is inordinate delay in lodging    the FIR and this unreasonable delay of 21 years    enabled the prosecution to introduce concocted    story for implicating the appellants and other    accuseds falsely by collecting manipulated evidence    which caused prejudice to the appellants and further    even if it is assumed that this delay has been caused    due to the promulgation of the Indemnity Ordi-    nance, 1975 but there is no explanation for about    three months from 26-6-1996, i.e. the date after    Awami League came to power.        ",
      "44. Then followed the judgment and order    dated 30th April, 2001 of the High Court Division    maintaining the conviction and sentence in respect    of three condemned prisoners including the appel-    lant Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) and accepting    their death reference and disposing the death    reference which is as follows:        “In the result, Death Reference No.30 of    1998 so far as it relates to Lieutenant Colonel    Syed Farook Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Lieutenant    Colonel Khandker Abdur Rashid, Major Md    Bazlul Huda, Lieutenant Colonel Shariful    Hoque Dalim, BU Lieutenant Colonel AM    Rashed Chowdhury, Lieutenant Colonel AKM    Mohiuddin (Lancer), Lieutenant Colonel    SHBM Nur ‘Chowdhury, Lieutenant Colonel    Md Aziz Pasha, Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin    Ahmed (Artillery), Resalder Moslemuddin @    Moslehuddin and Captain Abdul Mazed is    accepted confirming the death sentence and    accordingly, Criminal Appeal No.2616 of 1998    filed by accused Lieutenant Colonel Syed    Farook Rahman, Criminal Appeal No.2604 of    1998 filed by accused Lieutenant Colonel    Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Criminal Appeal    No. 2613 of 1998 filed by accused Major Md    Bazlul Huda and Criminal Appeal No.2617 of    1998 filed by Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin    Ahmed (Artillery) are dismissed but Death                          Reference No.30 of 1998 so far it relates to    accused Captain Md Kismat Hashem, Major    Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful Islam and    Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar is rejected and    the conviction and the sentence of these    accused are accordingly set aside and thereby    acquitting them of the charges levelled against    them in this case.”        ",
      "43. As it appears the appellants did not take    any exception to the aforesaid order of the Third    learned Judge and the learned Counsels on their    behalf then argued the appeals and the death    reference. Then the Third Jearned Judge, after    hearing, gave opinion as follows:        “In view of the discussions, reasons and    findings above in the body of this judgment, in    my opinion, accused Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-    uddin Ahmed (Artillery), Captain Abdul Mazed    and Resalder Moslemuddin @ Muslehuddin    were rightly convicted under sections 120B and    302/34 PC and sentenced to death under    sections 302/34 Penal Code by the learned    Sessions Judge, Dhaka and agreeing with my    learned brother ABM Khairul Hoque, J the        Death Reference, so far as it relates to Lieu-    tenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery),        Captain Abdul Mazed and Resalder Moslem.    uddin @ Moslehuddin, is accepted and the    Criminal Appeal No.2617 of 1998 filed by    accused Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed    (Artillery) is dismissed but the conviction and    sentence of accused Captain Md Kismat    Hashem, Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and    Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful    Islam passed by the learned Session Judge,    Dhaka in Sessions case No.319/97 are liable to    be set aside and the same are accordingly set    aside and accordingly, agreeing with my    brother Md Ruhul Amin J, the Death Reference    so far as it relates to Captain Md Kismat    Hashem, Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and    Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain @ Shariful    Islam is rejected.”        ",
      "42. Thereafter, the appellants filed applica-    tions before the Third leamed Judge praying for    hearing the death reference in respect of all the con-    demned prisoners for ends of justice and the Third    learned Judge, after hearing heard the learned    Counsel at length, by order dated 6th February, 2001    rejected the application on the following reasons:        “In view of the discussion above and    equally divided opinion of the learned Judges of    the Division Bench, | am of the opinion that the    cases of above 9 condemned prisoners over    whom the learned Judges not being divided in    opinion are not contemplated to be heard both    under the provisions of sections 378 and 429,    CrPC. But only the case of accused Abdul    Majed over whom there is difference as regards    the conviction under the two separate sections    of the Penal Code and cases of those 5 other    condemned prisoners over which the learned    Judges are equally divided in opinion i.e.    convicted by one learned Judge and acquitted    by another learned Judge, are before this Court    for an opinion. Upon delivery of the opinion by    this Court, the judgment and order shall follow    such opinion in order to dispose of the entire    death reference.”        ",
      "41. Regarding the submission made in    respect of “judgment” it appears that in view of the    difference of opinion as regards conviction of 6    accused persons the Division Bench by order dated    14th December, 2000 passed the following order:    <br>    “Death Reference accepted in part, CrlA    2604 of 1998, 2613 of 1998, and 2616 of 1998    ‘are dismissed. CrlA 2617 of 1998 is allowed by    Mr Justice Md Ruhul Amin by judgment in    separate sheets. BO Death Reference accepted    in part, CrlA 2604 of 1998, 2613 of 1998, 2616    of 1998 and 2617 of 1998 are dismissed by Mr    Justice ABM Khairul Haque vide judgment in    separate sheets.”        BO “14-12-2000 . As the judgment in Death    Reference No, 30 of 1998 is split one, let the    matter, as per provision of section 378 of the    Code of Criminal Procedure be placed before                       the learned Chief Justice for necessary orders,    Md Ruhul Amin ABM Khairal Haque, JJ.        ",
      "40. Further, even if it is assumed that the        Third learned Judge ought to have heard the        reference in respect of all the convicts, as we have    heard the appeals of the appellants at length on merit    as was done in Sajjan Singhs case (supra), the    appellants could not be said to have been prejudiced.        ",
      "39. As it appears the views taken by five-        member constitution bench of the Indian Supreme    Court in Babu'’s case (AIR 1965 SC 1467), holds the    field on the point and the said decision has been        followed in later cases as well and this is no cogent        ground to depart from those views as they are based    on correct construction of the provisions of law.        ",
      "38. In the case of Abdur Raziq vs State 16        DLR (WP) 73 it was observed that—  <br>      “there is nowhere laid down in sections    378 and 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code,    that the Third Judge should follow or may    follow the opinion of the Judge who has given    his opinion favouring the accused.” But    however if this proposition is accepted, then    there would have been no necessity in using the    expressions “such Judge, after such hearing as    he thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the    judgment or order shall follow such opinion” in    section 378 of the Code.        ",
      "37. As it appears in the case of Muhammad    Shafi vs Crown, 6 DLR (WP) 104 (FB) as referred by    the appellants, the learned Judges agreed with the    contention that “the Third Judge was exercising the    authority of a Bench of Judges and that, therefore,    he should consider for the purposes of section 12 of    the Sind Courts Act not as a single Judge, but as a    Bench”. | am of the view that the above case has no    manner of application in this case.        ",
      "36. Inthe case Bhagat Ram vs State of Raj-    sthan AIR 1972 SC 1502 the appeal filed by the    State against the acquittal of two accuseds B and R    of offences under sections 120B, 218, 347, 389    Penal Code is dismissed but there being difference    of opinion between the Judges of the Division    Bench as regards the correctness of the order of    acquittal of B in respect of offence under section    161, Penal Code and section 5(1)(a), Prevention of    Corruption Act and then the matter was referred to a    Third Judge under section 429, CrPC and the    Supreme Court of India, in view of above position    observed that it is not open to the Third Judge to    reopen the matter of acquittal of B in respect of    offences under sections 120B, 218, 347 for which an    express order had been made by the Division Bench    upholding the order of acquittal of the trial Judge    and that since the whole case had not been referred    under section 429 CrPC the Third Judge could go    only into the point of difference and arrive at his    conclusion.        ",
      "35. Similar view finds support in the case of    Nemai Mondal vs State of West Bengal AIR 1966    Cal 194 where it was held that “The case with the    differing opinion is placed before the Third J udge. It    is the duty of the Third Judge to decide the case and    not merely the points on which two Judges have    differed.        ",
      "34. ‘In the case of the State vs Abdul Khair    (supra) out of 3 accuseds, one committed the mur-    der and two others were standing with the motor-    bikes and convicted under sections 302/34 PC, But    in a split judgment on appeal, one Jearned Judge    acquitted two others. The Third Judge on an appeal    under section 429 of the Code only heard the case of    two others leaving the case of the condemned    accused who committed the murder.        ",
      "32. In State of UPV Dan Singh, (1997) 3    SCC 747 however two-member Bench of the Sup-    reme Court without considering the previous    decisions observed as follows:        “When the appeal as a whole is heard by    the Third Judge, he not only has an option of    delivering his opinion but, under the proviso to    section 392 of the Code of Criminal Procedure    he may require the appeal to be reheard and    decided by a large Bench of Judges. This was    an option which, under the provision, was also    open for any one of the two Judges, namely, BN    Katju and Rajeshwar Singh, JJ to exercise, but    they chose not to do so, What is clearly evident    is that the appeal is finally disposed of by the    judgment and order which follows the opinion    of the Third Judge. This being so special leave    petition could only have been filed after the    appeal was disposed of by the High Court vide    its final order dated 19-5-1988 . Even though the        said order purports to be related only to ten out    of thirty-two accused the said order has to be    read along with the earlier order of [5-4-1987    and, in law, the effect would be that the order            dated 19-5-1988 will be regarded as the final,    order whereby the appeal of the State was Party    allowed, with only two of the thirty-two,,    accused being convicted under section 325 reqq    with section 34, IPC, while all the other ACCUSEY        were acquitted.”        43, In Sajjan Singh (1999) SCC (Crip qq    also a Division Bench of the Supreme Court    ignoring the views taken in Babu’s Case, AIR 1965    SC 1467, and Hetubha Case, AIR 1970 SC 1266 dig    not approve the opinion taken by the Third Judge    and observed as follows:        “Statement of law is now quite explicit, I,    is the Third Judge whose opinion matters;    against the judgment that follows therefrom that    an appeal lies to this Court by way of special    leave petition under Article 136 of the Constj-    tution or under Article 134 of the Constitution    or under section 379 of the Code. The Third    Judge is, therefore, required to examine whole    of the case independently and it cannot be said    that he is bound by that part of the two opinions    of the two Judges comprising the Division    Bench where there is no difference. As a matter    of fact, the Third Judge is not bound by any    such opinion of the Division Bench. He is not    hearing the matter as if he is sitting in a three    Judge Bench where the opinion of majority    would prevail. We are thus of the opinion that    Prasad, J was not right in his approach and his    hands were not tied as far as the three appel-    lants, namely, Gajraj Singh, Meharban Singh    and Baboo Singh before him were concerned in    respect of whom both Judges of the Division    Bench opined that they were guilty and their    conviction and sentences were to be upheld.”        However in Sajjan Singh’s case despite the above    observations, the Court did not interfere with the    opinion of the Third Judge on the reasonings that    “Since we have heard the matter in respect of all the    three appellants at length we do not think it is    desirable now at this stage to remand the matter    when only some of the appellants could be said to    have been prejudiced because of the approach    adopted by Prasad, J”. The Supreme Court    thereupon heard the appeal on merit and dismissed    the appeal.                       ",
      "31. In Tanviben Pankaj Kumar Divetia vs    State of Gujarat (supra) it was observed:        “The plain reading of section 392 (our S        429) clearly indicates that it is for the Third        Judge to decide on what points he shall hear        arguments, if any, and it necessarily postulates        that the Third Judge is free to decide the appeal    by resolving the difference in the manner he    thinks proper.”        ",
      "30. In the case of Ananti P.    (supra) as it appears the Division Bench of the High    Court of Assam and Nagaland unanimously rejected    the first two contentions but were divided in their    Opinions on the points as to Whether the Magistrate    applied his mind to allow the investigating agency    lo investigate the cases and whether sanction under    section 196A wag necessary. The matter was then        laid before a Third Judge. The Third Judge held that    the Magistrate acted without        jurisdiction in allowing    agency to investigate into the    matter and accordingly he quashed the proceedings.    The question in dispute was whether a new point as    to the competency of the Magistrate at Delhi to    sanction investigation could have been raised before    the Third Judge since the said point had not been    raised before the Division Bench. AN Ray, J of the    Supreme Court approved the views taken in Het-    hubha Case (supra) wherein it was observed that    “the Third learned Judge could deal with the whole    case” and that there is no dispute in the statement of    law and it is in the discretion of the Third Judged to    deal with the case and in deciding the case if any    point is found necessary, he can decide the said    point as well. However in India, after amendment in    1973 section 429 was substituted by section 392    which reads as follows:      <br>  “392 . Procedure where Judges of Court of    appeal are equally divided—When an appeal    under this Chapter is heard by a High Court    before a Bench of Judges and they are divided    in opinion, the appeal, with their opinions, shall    be laid before another Judge of that Court, and    that Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit,    shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or    order shall follow that opinion;        Provided that if one of the Judges constitu-    ting the Bench, or where the appeal is laid    before another Judge under this section, that    Judge, so requires, the appeal shall be reheard    and decided by a larger Bench of Judges.”        It appears that the addition of a proviso as    above authorises one of the Judges constituting the    Division Bench or the Third Judge of a High Court                      of India, if so desires, can refer the appeal to a larger    Bench for rehearing and decision by such Bench of    Judges. The legislature has resolved the controversy    by addition of the proviso, in my view, in order to    remove the doubt about the conflicting views of the    Supreme Court of India, Under the present position,    fer the if the Division Bench requires, it may be    appeal for rehearing by a larger Bench of Judges if    there is difference of opinion on any point or points.    Similarly the Third Judge has been given the similar    discretionary power to refer the appeal to a larger    Bench if he does not agree with the opinion of the    Division Bench on any of the points involved in the    appeal decided by them.        ",
      "29. In the case of Hethubha (Supra) the    Supreme Court of India observed as follows:        “This Court in Babu vs State of Uttar    Pradesh, (1965) 2 SCR 771= (AIR 1965 SC    1467) held that it was for the Third learned    Judge to decide on what points the arguments    would be heard and therefore he was free to    resolve the differences as he thought fit. Mehta,    Jhere dealt with the whole case. Section 429 of    the Criminal Procedure Code states “that when    the Judges comprising the Court of Appeal are    equally divided in opinion, the case with their    opinion thereon, shall be laid before another    Judge of the same Court and such Judge, after    such hearing, if any, as he thinks fit, shall    deliver his opinion, and the Judgment and order    shall follow such opinion”. Two things are    noticeable; first, that the case shall be laid    before another Judge, and, secondly, the Judg-    ment and order will follow the opinion of the        Third learned Judge. It is, therefore, manifest    that the Third learned Judge     With the whole case,”        ",
      "27. In the case of Mohim Mandal vs State,    15 DLR 615 it was however observed that the    expression “difference of opinion” as used in the    sections 378 and 429 of the Code may be either as    regards the guilt or innocence of the accused or as to    the proper sentence to be passed. In either of these    cases the sections require the reference to be made    to another Judge. The Judge before whom the case    is laid for his opinion is entitled to pass any order he    thinks proper including an order directing retrial of    the accused. While confirming the sentence one    Judge may not accept a piece of evidence but accept!    the conviction and sentence in respect of an accused                          person but that does not mean that there is difference of opinion as regards conviction and sentence.    In the case of Babu vs State of (Supra),    on purport and power of the Third Judge came    sideration before a five-member Constitutional    up Bench of the Supreme Court of India. In that    rion pivision Bench differed in their opinions in    case and the conviction of three accused persons    and delivered two separate judgments. Before the    an ne Court the competency of the appeal was            “The section (S 429) contemplates that it is        for the Third Judge to decide on what points he    chall hear the arguments, if any, and that postu-    Jates that he is completely free in resolving the    difference as he thinks fit. In our judgment, it    was sufficient for Takru, J, to have said on the    question of the First Information Report that he    gid not consider it necessary to decide the point    put it was necessary, he was in agreement with    all that Mathur, J had said. There was, therefore,    a proper decision by Takru, J, and the certificate    could not be based upon the omission to discuss    the First Information Report and the doubts    about it.”        ",
      "26. In the case of Sarat Chandra Mitra vs     Emperor ILR 38 Cal 202, it was observed:    <br>    “I am not now concerned with the question,    of the trial of two petitioners with regard, to    one of who in the Judges composing the Court    of Appeal may be agreed in their opinion, While    as regards the others the Judges may be equally    divided in opinion. In such a contingency it is    quite possible to maintain the view that, upon p    reasonable interpretation of the term “case    what has to be laid before another Judge is the,    case of the prisoner as to whom the Judges are    equally divided in opinion. I am now concerned    only with the contingency in which the Judges    of the Court of Appeal are already divided in    opinion upon the question of the guilt of one    accused person, though upon certain aspects of    the case they may be agreed in their view, [n    such a contingency, what is laid before another    Judge, is, not the point or points upon which the    Judges are equally divided in opinion, but the    “case”. These obviously mean that, so far as the    particular accused is concerned, the whole case    is laid before the Third Judge, and it is his duty    to consider all the points involved, before he    delivers his opinion upon the case.”    <br>    As it appears in the case of Ahmed Sher vs Emperor    AIR 1931 (Lah) 513, Subeder Singh vs Emperor, AIR    1943 All 272, Nemai Mandal vs State of West    Bengal, AIR 1966 Cal 194 the above views have    been followed.        ",
      "25. On construction of sections 378 and 429    views taken by different High Courts are that what    is laid before another Judge is the “case” and    secondly, the judgment or order shall follow the    opinion given by such Judge and the opinion OF t    Third Judge will be regarded as the final juldgment.        ",
      "24. It also appears that though section 378 is    included in chapter XXVII of the Code of Criminal    Procedure under the heading “OF THE SUBMIS-    SION OF SENTENCES FOR CONFIRMATION”    and section 429 is included in chapter XXXI under    the heading “OF APPEALS” but the language used    in both the sections is almost identical. The    expressions “as he thinks fit” used in both the    sections postulate that the Third Judge is completely    free in resolving the difference as he thinks fit and    accordingly if he decides that there is no need to    hear the arguments in respect of any accused of    whom the Judges are not divided in their opinion, he    may decline to do so, It also appears that the use of    the words “equally divided” in both the sections    means the Judges differ in their opinions, in respect    of complicity of an accused or on the charge framed    against him or on any particular point but in a case    where the Judges concur with each other in respect    of a particular accused and in respect of the offence    charged, it cannot be said that Judges are equally    divided in respect, of the accused charged with,        ",
      "23. The provisions of sections 374,    376, 377, 474 and 429 of the Code of Criminal    Procedure are reproduced below:    <br>    “374, Sentence of death to be submitted hy    Court--When the Court of Sessions passes    semence of death, the proceeding shall be    submitted to the (High Court Division] and the    sentence shall not be executed unless it is    confirmed by the [High Court Division].    <br>    376, Power of High Court Division to    confirm sentence or annul conviction, In any    case submitted under section 374, the High    Court Division— :    <br>    (a) may confirm the sentence, or pass any    other sentence warranted by law, or    <br>    (b) may annul conviction, and convict the    accused of any offence of which the Sessions    Court might have convicted him, or order a new    trial on the same or an amended charge, or    <br>    (c) may acquit the accused person:        Provided that no order of confirmation    shall be made under this section until the period    allowed for preferring an appeal has expired, or,    if an appeal is presented within such period,    until such appeal is disposed of.    <br>    “377 . In every case so submitted, the    confirmation of the sentence, or any new    sentence or order passed by the High Court    Division shall, when such Court consists of two    ér more Judges, be made, passed and signed by    at least two of them.”    <br>    “378 . When any such case is heard before    a bench of Judges and such Judges are equally    divided in opinion, the case, with their opinions    thereon, shall be laid before another Judge, and    such Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit    shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or    other shall follow such opinion.”    <br>    “429, When the Judges composing the    Court of Appeal are equally divided in opinion,    the case, with their opinions thereon shall be    laid before another Judge of the same Court,    and such Judge after such hearing (if any) as he                      thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the    judgment or order shall follow such opinion.        The above provisions show that Whenever a    sentence of death is passed by a Court of Sessions    the proceedings of the case shall be submitted to the    Hich Court Division for the confirmation of    sentence under section 374 of the Code, In dealing    with a proceeding under section 374 the High Court    Division itself acts on its appellate side power    irrespective of whether the accused sentenced to    death preferred an appeal or not and accordingly, the    Hich Court Division is bound to consider the    evidence and then arrive at an independent    conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the    accused. The power of the High Court Division to    confirm the sentence is provided in section 376 of    the Code. A duty is imposed upon the High Court    Division to satisfy itself that the conviction of the    accused is justified on the evidence and that the    sentence of death in the circumstances of the case is    and appropriate one.        ",
      "22. While endorsing the said submissions,    the learned Attorney-General and Mr Ajmalul    Hossain QC added some points and cited some    decisions. Mr Ajmalul Hossain contends that there is    fundamental difference in sections 378 and 429 of    the Code of Criminal Procedure, inasmuch as while    in section 378 the expression “a bench of Judges”    has been used in section 429 the expression “the    Judges composing the Court of Appeal” has been    used and again in section 429 the expressions “of    the same Court” have not been used as used in the    other section. The learned Counsel further added    that a reference is required to be heard by at least    two Judges and the expression “bench of Judges”    used in section 378 means the sentence should have    to be confirmed and signed by at least two Judges    for the execution and a close reading of sections    374-378 would infer that the question of opinion of    the Third Judge arises when there is difference of    opinion of a bench of Judges and in a case where    there was no difference of opinion in respect of a    particular accused or accuseds the Third Judge was    left with no business to deal with his case and his    Opinion.

",
      "20. Mr Anisul Huq, the learned Counsel    (chief prosecutor) appearing for State, submitted    that the Third leamed Judge is perfectly justified in    hearing the case of six convicts only in respect of    whom the learned Judges of the High Court    Division were equally divided in their opinion;    section 377 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure    merely relates to the procedure for confirmation in    respect of reference made under section 374 of the    Code; the words “as he thinks fit” and the words    “the judgment and order shall follow such opinion”    used in sections 378 and 429 of the Code are signi-    ficant and a close reading of the above expressions    show that a wide discretion has been given to the    Third Judge by the legislature to decide the case    either in respect of whom there is no difference of    opinion or in respect of whom there is difference of    opinion, and the judgment and order shall follow    such opinion; in the present appeals the Third    learned Judge, exercising his discretion, passed    order dated 6-2-2001 holding that “the case of above    9 condemned prisoners over whom the learned    Judges not being divided in opinion are not contem-    plated to be heard both under the provisions of    sections 378 and 429 of the Code of Criminal    Procedure, But only the case of accused Abdul    Mazed over whom there is difference as regard the    conviction under the two separate sections of the                       penal Code and the cases of those five other    condemned prisoners over which the learned Judges    re equally divided in OPINION ccc \", and    cordingly, the Third learned Judge duly disposed    y the reference and the appeals by confirming the    vqtenc€ of nine convicts including the appellants    which is in conformity with the requirements as    provided in sections 378 and 429 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure.        ",
      "19. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, the learned    Counsel representing Major Md Bazlul Huda and    Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer), adopted    the submissions made by Khan Saifur Rahman and    Abdur Razaque Khan.        ",
      "17. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, the learned    Counsel for appellants Faruque Rahman and Mohi-    uddin (Artillery), further submitted that the learned    Chief Justice referred to the Third leaned Judge the    entire death reference not the piecemeal reference    for his disposal and so the Third learned Judge    should have heard the entire reference; the judgment    impugned is not a judgment in the eye of law as the    learned Judges expressed their opinion separately    and signed their opinion in violation of the provi-    sions of section 377 of the Code of Criminal    Procedure; since the learned Judges of the High    Court Division heard death reference as well as the    appeals both sections 378 and 429 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure are applicable and so opinion of    Third learned Judge shall be the conclusive opinion    and judgment and the order shall follow on that    basis which was not done in the present appeals; the    opinion of the Third Judge is also in no way a con-    current opinion in respect of the appellants Faruque    Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (Artillery)    specially when the first learned Judge disbelieved    their confessional statements while the second    learned Judge believed those.        18 Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, the learned    Counsel for the appellant Sultan Shahriar, further    submitted that in the present appeals there is no    confirmation of sentence in the eye of law since    there is no consensus confirmation of the sentence    by the High Court Division; the opinion of the        learned Judges of the High Court Division in jh,    present case cannot also be regarded as “judgmeny:    and as held in the case of Md Shafi vs Crown 6 Dip    (WP) 104 (FB) and the case of Abdur Razik vs Stay,    16 DLR (WP) 73 in case of difference of Pinion    while confirming the sentence, the opinion of the    Third Judge will prevail; the learned Judges of the    High Court Division also did not consider the    principles as laid down in the case of Hethubha yy    State of Gujrat AIR 1970 SC 1266, Union of India \\    Ananti Padmanabiah (1971) SCC (Crl) 533, Sajjan    Singh vs State of UP (1999 SCC 315 (Cri) 44 and    Mahim Mandal vs State 15 DLR 615 and committed    error in upholding the conviction and sentence.        ",
      "16. All the above mentioned petitions for    Jeave to appeal having raised the same question of    jaw and fact were disposed of by one leave granting    order granting leave as follows:      <br>  “(a) the leamed Judges of the Division Bench    of the High Court Division dealing with    the Death Reference and the connected cri-    minal appeals delivered two separate and    parallel judgments and signed their    individual judgment. These two separate    judgments signed separately cannot be    taken to be the judgment of the High Court    Division. This shows that the learned    Judges gave dissenting judgments and this    became palpable from the order dated 14-    12-2000 passed by the learned Judges    stating that the judgment given by them in    the Death Reference No.30 of 1998 was a    split one. Accordingly, the matter was    referred by the learned Judges to the    learned Chief Justice for necessary order.    Thereafter, the learned Chief Justice by    order dated 15-1-2001 appointed Mr    Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim as the    Third Judge to dispose of the Death    Reference as a whole meaning the case of    15 convicts. In this background of the    matter, it is strongly contended by the    learned Counsels that the Death Reference    case in its entirety was referred to the    Third Judge for disposal. Hence the    learned Third Judge having considered the    case of only 6(six) convicts committed an    error of law occasioning failure of justice.    <br>    (b) the occurrence took place in the early    morning on 15-8-1975, But the informant    PW | AFM Mohitul Islam was all along in    Dhaka after the occurrence and he joined    as a receptionist in the Bangabhaban on    3rd September, 1975 after the occurrence    and continued in service till he filed the    FIR on 2-10-1996 after a long lapse of        more than 21 years. This unreasonable    delay in lodging the FIR speaks of ill    intention and a design on the part of the    prosecution to falsely implicate the    convict petitioners in the occurrence on the    basis of concocted and manipulated evi-    dence to the prejudice of the convict peti-    tioners. The Courts below including the    High Court Division erred in failing to    consider this aspect while adjudging the    involvement of the convict petitioners in    the occurrence and also in convicting and    awarding capital sentence to them.    <br>    (c) although the evidence and materials on    record go to show that it was a case of    mutiny leading to the murder of the then    President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his    family members and not a case of murder    simpliciter but the convicts including the    convict petitioners were tried and con-    victed by a normal criminal Court as a case    of murder simpliciter. Hence the trial was    vitiated.    <br>    (d) the evidence and materials on record will    only show that there was no case of cri-    minal conspiracy for murder but a case of    criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny to    change the then Mujib Government.    Hence the conviction and sentence of the    convict petitioners are liable to be set    aside.    <br>    (e) charge of murder against the convict    petitioners under section 302 read with    section 34 of the Penal Code has not been    proved on the basis of proper evaluation    and sifting of evidence on record and thus    there has been a miscarriage of justice.”    <br>    As it appears at the trial, the prosecution tried to    establish its case against the appellants and other    accuseds on the basis of the evidence of the PWs,    confessional statement of appellants Faruque    Rahman, Sultan Shahriar and Mohiuddin (Artillery),    extra-judicial confession proved by PWs 15 and 8,    electronic evidence, and also circumstantial evi-    dence relating to conspiracy and, on the other hand,    the appellants and other accuseds tried to show that                          they were innocent, the confessional statements of    the above three appellants were not voluntary and    the President and his family members were killed as    a consequence of a successful revolt of the army    against the then Government. Regarding the ground    that the Third learned Judge should have heard the    entire reference, ig. the cases of all the fifteen    convicts instead of six convicts only, the common    submissions of the learned Counsels for the    appellants are that since the learned Judges of the    High Court Division delivered dissenting opinions,    the Third learned Judge ought to have heard the    entire death reference but he heard the reference    only in respect of six accuseds and so the present    reference as well as the appeals should be sent back    on remand to the Third learned Judge for hearing of    the death reference and the appeals afresh.

      "15. Mohiuddin (Lancer) was tried and con-    victed in absentia due to his absconsion outside the    country and subsequently he was arrested from USA    and brought back in the country in July 2007 and    was sent to jail and he then filed Jail Petition No.9    of 2007 and subsequently filed an application for    condonation of delay stating that he had no know-    ledge of the case and the judgment of conviction and    sentence. This was opposed by the State by filing an                      affidavit. On hearing both the sides the delay being    condoned he filed Criminal Petition for Leave to    Appeal No.343 of 2007 which was heard analo-    gously with Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal    Nos. 95, 96, 97 and 98 of 2001.        ",
      "14. The Third learned Judge, after hearing,    on consideration of the facts and circumstances of    the case and materials available on record, took the    view that the prosecution has failed to prove the case    as against accuseds Major Ahmed Shariful Hossajp    alias Shariful Islam, Captain Md Kismat Hashem    and Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and having    found them as not guilty for the offence chargeg    acquitted them therefrom. The Third learned Judge,    however, found appellant Mohiuddin (Artillery),    accused Captain Abdul Mazed and Resalder Mos-    lemuddin alias Moslehuddin guilty for the offence    charged under sections 120B/302 and 34 of the    Penal Code and maintained their sentence of death    under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code agreeing    with ABM Khairul Haque J and accordingly,    accepted the Death Reference so far it related to    them and dismissed Criminal Appeal No.2617 of    1998 filed by the accused Lieutenant Colonel (Retd)    Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) and the conviction    and sentence of accuseds Captain Md Kismat    Hashem, Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain alias    Shariful Islam passed by the learned Sessions Judge,    Dhaka in Sessions Case No. 319 of 1997 was set    aside by the Third learned Judge holding them not    guilty agreeing with the view taken by Md Ruhul    Amin, J and accordingly, the Death Reference so far    as it related to Captain Md Kishmat Hashem,    Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and Major Ahmed    Shariful Hossain alias Shariful Islam was rejected.

      "11. Mr Khairul Hug J the other companion    Judge of the Bench however found all the 15    accuseds including the appellants guilty for the    offence charged and thereby affirmed the judgment    and sentence so passed by the trial Court and    accepted the Death Reference.        ",
      "10. | Then the Death Reference and all above    4 (four) Appeals were heard together by a bench of    the High Court Division consisting of two Judges,    out of whom Md Ruhul Amin J the presiding Judge    found the present appellants along with 4 others    guilty for the offence charged and maintained the    conviction and sentence under sections 302/34 and    120B of the Penal Code passed by the trial Court in    Sessions Case No.319 of 1997 and accepted the    Death Reference so far it related to four of the    present appellants and 4 others with a modification    of the mode of execution of sentence of death and    thereby accepted the Death Reference in part and    dismissed the conviction and sentence so far it    related to 5 accuseds including appellant Mohiuddin    (Artillery) under sections 302/34 and 120B of the    Penal Code and accordingly, the Death Reference so    far it relates to them was not accepted.        ",
      "9. Being aggrieved by the impugned order    of conviction and sentence, appellant Faruque                      Rahman preferred Criminal Appeal No. 2616 of    1998, appellant Sultan Shahriar preferred Criminal    Appeal No. 2604 of 1998 and the appellant Mohi-    uddin (Artillery) preferred Criminal Appeal No.    1617 of 1998 . Appellant Bazlul Huda, who    althrough remained absconding during the whole    period of trial, was brought back from Bangkok to    Dhaka on the date of the pronouncement of judg-    ment of the trial Court i.c, 8-11-1998, in pursuance    of an extradition proceedings against him in    Bangkok and he then filed a regular appeal against    his conviction and sentence being Criminal Appeal    No. 2613 of 1998 before the High Court Division.        ",
      "8. The trial Court, thereafter, in conside-    ration of the evidence on record as well as facts and    circumstances of the case by judgment and order    dated 8-11-1998, acquitted four of the accused per-    sons, namely, |. Taheruddin Thakur, 2 . Hon. Captain    A Wahab Joarder, 3 . Dafader Marfat Ali Shah    (absconding), 4 .

The aforesaid 15 accuseds including the appellants    were not found guilty under section 201 of the Penal    Code and were acquitted on that charge.        ",
      "7. Prosecution examined 61 witnesses out    of whom some were tendered by the prosecution    and not cross-examined by the defence. The defence    did not adduce any evidence. After close of the    prosecution witnesses the three appellants on dock    were examined under section 342 of the Code of    Criminal Procedure to which they repeated their    innocence. The defence case as could be gathered    from the trend of cross-examination is total denial    and that the appellants are innocent and the    occurrence did not take place in the manner as    alleged, inasmuch as the occurrence is the result of    successful mutiny by some Army personnel.        ",
      "6. Appellants Farook Rahman, Sultan Shah-    riar and Mohiuddin (Artillery), who were present in    the trial Court pleaded not guilty to the charges and    prayed to be tried. They were defended by the    learned Advocates of their own choice while the rest    14 absconding accused persons were defended by    the learned Advocates appointed by the State.        ",
      "5. The learned trial Court Judge also        framed another charge under section 201 of the        Penal Code for wilfully causing disappearance of    the evidence.        ",
      "4. The learned Sessions Judge by his Order    No. 15 dated 7-4-1997 framed the following charges    against the accused persons.                      First charge: The accused persons in collusion    with Late Khondker Mushtaque Ahmed, Late Mah-    bubul Huq Chashi, Resalder Syed Sarowar Hossain    and Captain M Mostafa Hossain, in order to satisfy    ant personal grievance to fulfil joint interest, to    ea personal aggrandisement and ambition with    ae motive, they met and conspired/together on    Paeet dates since March, 1975, at different    is ces, namely, at the residence of Lieutenant Colo-    “| Khondker Abdur Rashid at his residence at the    phaka Cantonment, BARD at Comilla, Shalna at    Gazipur the village residence of Khondker Moshtaq    ahmed at Daspara within PS and Daudkandi and at    pis residence at 54, Aga Mosi Lane, at Ramna Park,    at the residence of Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shah-    riat Rashid Khan at the Cantonment and in other    places in order to murder Bangabandhu Sheikh    Mujibur Rahman, the then President of Bangladesh,    hig relations and his family members. In order to    achieve their such objective, they assembled at    palur ghat within Cantonment Police Station on the    night following 14th August, 1975 and in fulfilment    of such conspiracy, the accused persons killed 1]    ersons on the morning of 15th August including the    then President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his    family members. As such, they committed an    offence under section 120B of the Penal Code.        Second Charge: In pursuance of the said    premeditore conspiracy and in furtherance of their    common intention, (to carry out the object of the    said criminal conspiracy) the accused persons men-    tioned in the first charge in collusion with late    Khondker Mushtaque Ahmed, late Mahbubul Alam    Chashi, Resalder Syed Sarwar Hossain and Captain    M Moshtaq Ahmed in order to vindicate their own    personal vendetta and joint interest and ambitions in    fulfilment of their conspiratorial scheme, armed    with deadly weapons, such as, tanks, cannons,    machineguns, stunguns, rifles attacked (the resi-    dence of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the    then President of Bangladesh at 677, Dhanmondi    Residential Area, Road No. 32 and murdered Ban-    gabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his wife Begum    Fazilat-un-nessa, sons Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal,    Sheikh Russell. daughters-in-law, Sultana Kamal,    Rozy Jamal and brother Sheikh Naser.

      "3. Among the 19 accused persons who    faced trial, 14 were absconding. The learned Judges    of the High Court Division found that the warrants    of their arrests were duly issued and when they    could not be apprehended by the police in spite of    their efforts, their properties both movable and    immovable were attached in accordance with the    provisions of the Code and thus the requirements of    sections 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Proce-    dure were satisfied and since the said accuseds    remained fugitives from law, necessary notices were    duly published in the newspaper, as required under    section 339B of the Code. Records also show that all    possible and practicable steps were taken to bring    the fugitives before the Court.        ",
      "2. The prosecution case, as stated by the    informant, PW 1, in his deposition is that he was the    Personal Assistant of the then President of Bangla-    desh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, hereinafter referred    to as the President, and was on duty from 8-00 PM    on 14th August, 1975 at the residence of the Presi-    dent at Road No.32, Dhanmondi.

In the former the gist for the offence is bare agreement and association to break law even though illegal act does not follow while the gist of an offence under section 34 is the commission of a criminal act in furtherance of a common intention of all the offenders which means that there should be a unity of criminal behaviour resulting in something for which an individual will be punishable if it is done by himself alone.

      "Section 120B—A conspiracy is a matter of Inferene¢ deduced from certain criminal acts of the parties accused done in pursuance of apparent criminal purpose common between them. A criminal conspiracy consists not merely intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. When two agree to carry it into effect the very plot of the act itself, and the act of each of the parties capable of being enforced, if lawful, possible if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means.

It is not necessary that the abettor should concert the offence with the Person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence iS committed.

      "  Commutation of sentence—Delay—There ar uniform decisions of our Superior Courts that meye delay is not a legal ground for the commutation of sentence of death.(Per SK Sinha J). Major Bazly| Huda vs State (Criminal) |<br>  Constitution—Supreme Law—Since the Constitution is the Supreme law of the land and the Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations and Orderg promulgated made by the usurpers, being illegal, void and non-est in the eye of law, could not be ratified or confirmed by the Second Parliament by the Fifth Amendment, as it itself had no such power to enact such laws as made by the above Proclamations, Martial Law Regulation or orders. Khondker Delwar Hossain vs Bangladesh Ilialian Marble Works (Civil) 298 <br> Doctrine of necessity—Doctrine of State necessity is no magic wand. It does not make an illegal act a legal one. But the Court in exceptional circumstances, in order to avert the resultant evil of illegal legislations, may condone such illegality on the greater interest of the community in general but on condition that those acts could have been legally done at least by the proper authority. Khondker Delwar Hossain vs Bangladesh Italian Marble Works (Civil) | : 298 <br> Doctrine of Severability—While declaring any. law ultra vires, the Court often applies the doctrine of severability to limit the application of the judicial verdict. This is no legislative act though such a decision modifies or even destroys a legislation.  Khondker Delwar  Hossain Bangladesh Italian Maible Works (Civil) 298 <br> Due process of law—The phrase due process of law”is synonymous with ‘law of the land’ as used in the famous twenty-ninth chapter of ‘Magna Charta’ which declared that “no freeman shall be aken, OF imprisoned, or dissiezed, or outlawed, or panished, or in any way destroyed, nor will the king iss upon him or commit him to prison, unless by he judgment of his peers or the law of the land.” This principle has been adopted in the Fifth and pourteenth Amendments of the American Constitution. Both these amendments prohibit deprivation of life, liberty or property ‘without due process of law’. The essence of the concept is fimess and avoidance of arbitrariness. (Per SK sinha J) Major Bazlul Huda vs State (Criminal) 111 <br> Effect of Martial Law—They serve the “peop]e” and can never become the masters of the “people”. Accordingly  Martial Law s unconstitutional and illegal and it is a mischievous device not founded in any law known in Bangladesh and by Martial Law the whole nation is hijacked by some people with the support of the armed forces and the whole nation goes into a state of siege; it is like that the whole nation and “We, the people of Bangladesh”, are taken hostage and further like a hostage-taking situation, the hostage takers themselves recognize that there is a superior law than their weapons which “We, the people” put in their hands to serve us and they recognize that there are two impediments to their taking over power or assuming power, first, the Constitution itself and so they, at first, start by saying “Notwithstanding anything in the Constitution” because they recognize that the Constitution is superior but they choose to brush it aside. The second impediment to Martial Law is the Superior Court of the Republic tntrusted with the solemn duty to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution” and so every Martial Law, immediately upon Proclamation seeks to curb the powers of the Court, particularly, the powers of the Constitutional Court. Khondker Delwar Hossain  vs Bangladesh Italian Marble Works (Civil) 298 <br> Election Petition—Election process starts from the notification issued by the: competent. authority declaring election schedule and culminates in the declaration of result of election by a gazette notification and thereafter the question in respect of the effect of pendency of the appeal against the orders of conviction and sentence becomes an election dispute which can only be raised by way of an election petition. Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir vs Bangladesh (Civil) 425 <br> Extra Constitutional Adventure—Our total disapproval of Martial Law and suspension of the Constitution or any part thereof in any form. The perpetrators of such illegalities should also be suitably punished and condemned: so that in future no adventurist, no usurper, would dare to defy the people, their Constitution, their Government, established by them with their consent. However, it is the Parliament, which can make law in this regard. Let us bid farewell kinds of extra constitutional adventure forever. Khondker Delwar Hossain vs Bangladesh Italian Marble Works (Civil) 298 <br> Partition Suit—Partition suit ending in a final decree or an amicable partition of the property among the admitted co-sharer through a registered deed of partition put an absolute end to co- sharership for all practical purpose irrespective of separation or splitting of land or Jama through mutation proceeding. Aktaruzzaman vs Abdur Rashid Khan (Civil) 250 <br> Pre-emption—After passing of the final decree in partition suit, it is effective between the admitted co-sharers and for the purpose of a pre- emption proceeding were the transfer is made by a co-sharer to a stranger. Aktaruzzaman vs Abdur Rashid Khan (Civil) 250  <br> Pre-emption—The passing of the final decree in a partition suit finally determines the right of the co-sharers in the land. Aktaruzzaman vs Abdur  Rashid Khan (Civil) 250 <br> Pre-emption—The application for the pre- emptor on the basis of co-sharership is not maintainable. Aktaruzzaman vs Abdur Rashid Khan  (Civil) 250  Rule of Law—The concept of rule of law is recognised all over the world, and our founding fathers of the Constitution also adopted that principle, but we failed to apply the same in the case of the killing of our Father of the Nation. (Per SK Sinha J). Major Bazlul Huda vs State (Criminal) 1  Remand—It is now well settled that the remand orders are not to be made as a matter of  course. The High Court Division as a revlgmnl Court is required to properly appreciate the rejey, Ange of the evidence on record before making such Order o remand. Since there is no necessity for taking any further evidence in the interest of resolution qf the dispute on title, the order of remand passed by the High Court Division cannot be sustained.

Araur Rahman vs Bangladesh  spl Original) 329    Precedence—As per the impugned Warrant  of Precedence, the Table will be observed with  respect o the precedence of persons named therein.  So the meaning of the word 'precedence’ is very  crucial relating 10 the placement of the District  Judges in the said Table. 'Precedence’ means the  order or priority in place or time observed by or for  persons of different status (such as political  dignitaries) on the basis of rank during ceremonial  events and another meaning of the word s generally  the act or state of going before something else  according 1o some system of priorities.    \"Precedence’ means priority and that priority is  necessarily and essentially predicated upon one's  status. The meaning of ‘status' js g person's legal  condition, whether personal or proprietary; the sum  total of a person's legal rights, duties, liabilities and  other legal relations, or any particular group of them  separately considered. So while formulating or  making the Table of the Warrant of Precedence, the  status of a functionary, either constitutional or  public, cannot be sneezed at. But in the impugned                   Warrant of precedence some functionaries ha  been placed far below others in derogation to their  dignity, status and priority.

      "799. There is no denial of the’fact the appel-  lants and other accused persons not only killed the  sitting President of the country, they killed the entire  family. The victim, the then President, who had sac-  rificed his life for the cause of the people his strug-  gle for the just and the democratic rights of the peo-  ple of the country was marked by extraordinary  patriotism. The liberation struggle of Bangladesh  from the treacherous occupation of the marauding  military ruler of Pakistan was a rare example of a  patriot was fought by the people from inside and  outside under order of Bangabandhu which was  clearly proclaimed in a historic public meeting on  7th March 1971. This historic speech not only pro-  claimed guidelines for action but also inspired the  deep determination of the people to fight for the  independence. He was determined on the creation of    independent Bangladesh and advanced strategical  through the Six-Point charter of demands. The six  points were later on led to one point the independ-  ence from which Bangabandhu did not retract,  Consequently we had achieved our independence.  The accused persons brutally killed such a leader,  who is none but the Father of the Nation. They even  did not spare a child, son of the President who was  below 10 years age. They killed him in such a bru-  tal manner the nation was shocked and dumbfound.  ed. There was no explanation why they also killed  three women. They committed the crime against  humanity by killing a child and three innocent  women who were unarmed. They eliminated almost  the entire family who were found in the house.  There is no explanation on the side of the accused as  to why they killed these innocent persons. The acts  of the accused was so barbarous which could only  be compared with orgies. The accused persons by  their barbarous act proved that the object of the con-  spiracy was not to oust the President from power,  but their object was to eliminate the entire family  and it was an act of exceptional depravity on the part  of the accused persons, an unparalleled act in the  annals of crime’ committed in the country. Although  there is no evidence against all the accused persons  of directly participating in the carnage but it should  be borne in mind that for the killing of the sitting  President, all the accused persons with a view to  attainment of the object played different roles.  Without jointly operating in concert the criminal  object could not have been executed. It was not pos-  sible to bring about the result of the criminal object  without support of all. In view of the matter, all the  conspirators who actually participated, acted in the  crime do not deserve any leniency in the matter of  sentence. On consideration of the brutality in the  commission of the offence, the appellants and other  co-accused do not deserve any leniency in the mat-  ter of sentence. The appellants failed to make out a  case of mitigating circumstance to commute their  sentence.  <br>  The sentence awarded to the appellants calls for  no inference by this Court. Accordingly, I affirm  their sentence.  <br>  Ed.

      "798. According to our provision the Court has  been left with the discretion on the facts of the given  case whether or not a sentence of death should be  awarded, and in case of awarding a sentence of  death the Court is required to assign reason. The  Court is of course keeping in mind while awarding  the extreme sentence whether there is mitigating cir-  cumstances to exercise such discretion. The mitigat-  ing circumstances in the exercise of Court’s discre-  tion as analysed in Jogmohan’ case are undoubted-  ly relevant circumstance and might be given weight  in the determination of sentence.    ",
      "797. Our Appellate Division in the case of A.  Khair vs State, 44 DLR (AD) 225 held that delay  itself is not an extenuating circumstance to commute  the sentence, The observations are as under:    “Delay by itself in the execution of sen-  tence of death is by no means an extenuating  circumstance for commuting the sentence of  death to imprisonment for life. There must be  other circumstances of a compelling nature  which together with delay will merit such com-  mutation. We find no compelling extenuating  circumstance in this case and therefore, find no  ground whatsoever to interfere.”    ",
      "796. In the Indira Gandhi killing case, in  Kehar Singh's case (AIR 1988 SC 1883) similar ques-  tion was raised about the imposition of extreme sen-  tence of death in the context of section 354(3) of the  Code of 1973. The Supreme Court of India while  maintaining the death sentence of Kehar Singh and  Satwant Singh, GL Oza, J observed as follows :    “The person killed is a lady and no less  than the Prime Minister of this country who was  the elected leader of the people. In our country  we have adopted and accepted a system where-  in change of the leader is permissible by ballot  and not by bullet. The act of the accused not  only takes away the life of popular leader but  also undermines our system which has been  working so well for the last forty years. There is  yet another serious consideration. Beant Singh  and Satwant Singh are persons who were post-  ed on the security duty of the Prime Minister.  They are posted there is protect her from any  intruder or from any attack from outside and  therefore if they themselves resort to this kind  of offence, there appears to be no reason or no  mitigating circumstance for consideration on  the question of sentence. Additionally, an  unarmed lady was attacked by these two per-  sons with a series of bullets and it was found  that a number of bullets entered her body. The  manner in which mercilessly she was attacked  these two persons on whom the confidence was  reposed to give her protection repels any con-  sideration of reduction of sentence. In this view  of the matter, even the conspirator who inspired  the persons who actually acted does not deserve                  any leniency in the matter of sentence. In our  opinion, the sentence awarded by the trial Court  and maintained by the High Court appears to be  just and proper.”    ",
      "794. In Machhi Singh vs State of Punjab, AIR  083 SC 957, after considering Jagmohan’s case  and some other cases on the point of sentence, the  Supreme Court of India classified the cases in which  death penalty may be imposed as follows: “When  the victim of murder is (a) an innocent child who  could not have or has not proved even an excuse,  much less a provocation, for murder, (b) a helpless  woman or a person rendered helpless by old age or  infirmity, (c) when the victim is a person vis-a-vis  whom the murderer is in a position of domination or  trust, (d) when the victim is a public figure general-  ly loved and respected by the community for the  services rendered by him and the murder is commit-  ted for political or similar reasons other than per-  sonal reasons.”    795, In the murder case of Rajiv Gandhi, the  ex-Prime Minister of India, the Supreme Court of  India while maintaining the death sentence under  section 354(3) of the Code in the case of Nalini  (1999) 5 SCC 253, DP Wadhwa, J observed as fol-  lows:    “A former Prime Minister of the country  was targeted as this country had entered into an  agreement with a foreign country in exercise of  its sovereign powers. Rajiv Gandhi, being the  head of the Government at that time, was sig-  natory to the Accord which was also signed by  the head of the Government of Sri Lanka. The  Accord had the approval of.Parliament. It was  not that Rajiv Gandhi had entered into the  Accord in his personal capacity or for his own  benefit. Though we have held that object of the  conspiracy was not to commit any terrorist act  or any disruptive activity, nevertheless murder  of a former Prime Minister for what he did in  the interest of the country was an act of excep-  tional depravity on the part of the accused, an    unparalleled act in the annals of crime commit-  ted in this country. In a mindless fashion not  only was Rajiv Gandhi killed but along with  him others died and many suffered grievous and  simple injuries, It is not that intensity of the belt  bomb strapped on the waist of Dhanu was not  known to the conspirators as after switching on  the first switch on her belt bomb Dhanu asked  Sivarasan to move away. Haribabu was so keen  to have close-up pictures of the crime that he met  his fate in the blast itself. We are unable to find  any mitigating circumstance not (sic) to upset the  award of sentence of death on the accused.”    ",
      "793. In Bachan Singh's case, Bachan Singh  was convicted and sentenced to death under section  302 for murder of three persons. His sentence of  death was confirmed by the Punjab High Court. His  appeal by Special Leave came up for hearing before  a Division Bench. The leave was granted to consid-  er whether “the facts found by the Courts below  would be ‘special reasons’ for awarding the death  sentence as required under section 354(3) of the  Code of Criminal Procedure 1973”. The Division  Bench of the Supreme Court referred the matter to a  Constitutional Bench for a decision in regard to the  constitutional validity of death penalty for murders  provided in section 302 and the sentencing proce-  dure embodied in section 354(3) of the Code. The  Supreme Court by a majority maintained the sen-  tence of death observing as follows:  <br>  (c) The normal rule is that the offence of  murder shall be punished with the sentence of  life imprisonment. The Court can depart from  that rule and impose the sentence of death only  if there are special reasons for doing so. Such  reasons must be recorded in writing before  imposing the death sentence.  <br>  (d) While considering the question of sen-  tence to be imposed for the offence of murder                  under section 302, Penal Code, the Court must  have regard to every relevant circumstance  relating to the crime as well as the criminal. If  the Court finds, but not otherwise, that the  offence is of an exceptionally depraved and  heinous character and constitutes, on account of  its design and the manner of its execution , a  source of grave danger to the society at large,  the Court may impose the death sentence.”    ",
      "792. What are the mitigating circumstances in  the exercise of Court’s discretion have been explain-    ed thus: (apthat the offence was committed under the  influence of extreme mental or emotional distur.  bance; (b)the age of the accused-if the accused js  young or old, he shall not be sentenced to de h;  (c)the probability that the accused would not com.  mit criminal acts of violence as would constitute 4  continuing threat to society; (d) in the facts and cir.  cumstances of the case the accused believed that he  was morally justified in committing the offence:  (e)the accused acted under duress or domination of  another person , and (f) the condition of the accused  showed that he was mentally defective and that the  said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the  criminality of his conduct. In Jagmohan the follow-  ing circumstances are considered in mitigation of  punishment which should be inflicted such as (j)  absence of bad intention; (ii) provocation; (iii) self.  preservation; (iv) preservation of some near friends:  (v) transgression of the limit of self-defence; (vi)  submission to the menaces; (vii) submission to  authority; (viii) drunkenness; (ix) childhood.    ",
      "791. In India this onerous duty is cast upon Judges and for more than a century the Judges are carving out this duty under the Indian Penal Code. The impossibility of laving down standards is at the very core of the criminal law as administered in India which invests the Judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment. That discretion in the matter of sentence is liable to be corrected by superior Courts. Laving down of standards to the limited extent possible as was done in the Model Judicial Code would not serve the purpose.  The exercise of judicial discretion on well recog-  nised principles is in the final analysis the safest  possible safeguards for the accused. It is further said  that there is no merit in the contention that uncon-  trolled and unguided discretion in the Judges to  impose capital punishment or imprisonment for life  is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution. If the Law  has given to the Judge a wide discretion in the mat-  ter of sentence to be exercised by him after balanc-  ing all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances  of the crime it will be impossible to say that there  would be at all any discrimination since facts and  circumstances of one case can hardly be the same as  the facts and circumstances of another. While exer-  cising the discretion Palekar, J . argued as follows:    In Jogmahan Singh case it is said that    “A large number of murders is undoubted-  ly of common type. But some at least are dia-  bolical in conception and cruel in execution, In  some others where the victim is a person of  high standing in the country, society is liable to  be rocked to its very foundation. Such murders  cannot simply be whisked away by finding ali-  bis in the social maladjustment of the murderer.  Prevalence of such crimes speaks, in opinion of  many, for the inevitability of death penalty not  only by way of deterrence, but as a token  emphatic disapproval by the society”,    ",
      "790. Under this new provision life sentence is  now the rule and it is only in exceptional cases, for  special reasons to be assigned, the death sentence  can be imposed. Our sentencing procedure is com-  pletely distinct from that of the India procedure. In  India a sentence of death can be imposed by a Court  in exceptional cases on assigning reasons for impo-  sition of such sentence. The constitutionality of  imposition of sentence has been challenged in Jog-  mohan Singh vs State of UP, AIR 1973 SC 947. It is  stated that the sentencing procedure and section 302  so far the imposition of death sentence are violative  of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India. It  is urged that the law has given to the Judge a wide  discretion in the matter of sentence to be exercised  by him after balancing all the aggravating and miti-  gating circumstances of the crime and that no law  can deprive the life of a citizen unless it is reason-  able and in the public interest. It is further urged that  capital punishment cannot be regarded per se unrea-  sonable or not in public interest. Article 14 is simi-  lar to Article 27 of our Constitution and Article 19  corresponds to the combination of Articles 29, 36,  37 and 38 of our Constitution. Jogmohan & case was  reconsidered by a larger Constitution Bench in  Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab AIR 1980 SC 898.  It was urged that the sentencing procedure provided  in section 354(3) of the Code of 1973 is violative of  Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. Article 21  of the Indian Constitution is similar to Article 32 of  our Constitution. It was held by majority that the  procedure for sentencing does not violate Articles  14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, It is said that for                  making a choice of punishment or ascertaining the  existence or absence of ‘special reasons’ the Court  must pay due regard to both the erime and the crim-  inal, What is the relative weight to be given to the  ravating and mitigating factors depends on the  facts and circumstances of a particular case.    ",
      "789. This provision shows that it is left to the  discretion of the Court on the facts of each case to  Pass a sentence of death or a lesser sentence, and the  Court while awarding the sentence shall have to  assign reason. The Courts are principally concerned    with the facts and circumstances of the crime under  inquiry and decide whether there are aggravating or  mitigating circumstances to award a sentence of  death or life sentence. In India section 367(5) has  been reenacted in the Code of 1973. The correspon-  ding provision is provided in section 354(3) which  reads as follows:    “Section 354(3) when the conviction is for  a sentence punishable with death or, in the alter-  native, with imprisonment for life or imprison-  ment for a term of years, the judgment shall  state the reasons for the sentence awarded, and,  in case of sentence of death, the special reason  for such sentence”.    ",
      "788. Let us now consider the provisions of  law in case of awarding a sentence of death. The  provision contained in section 367(5) of the Code  reads as follows:    “(5) if the accused is convicted of an  offence punishable with death or, in the alterna-  tive, with imprisonment for life or imprison-  ment for a term years, the Court shall in its  judgment state the reasons for the sentence  awarded,”    ",
      "787. The learned Sessions Judge has taken  into consideration the provisions of law and rightly  exercised his discretion in awarding the sentence.  The second learned Judge while maintaining the  sentence observed “in this case, 11(eleven) innocent  persons were brutally and diabolically murdered.  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the then President of  Bangladesh, became a target of vicious intrigue and  was murdered by a handful of disgruntled army offi-  cers, some of whom were dismissed. With him  10(ten) other persons including 3(three) ladies and  \\(one) boy were also murdered. The manner in  which they were so brutally and mercilessly mur-  dered ripples any consideration of reduction of sen-  tence. As such, none of the accused deserves any  leniency in the matter of sentence”, It seems that the  leamed Judge is conscious about the requirement of  law and has maintained the sentence on assigning  reasons required by law.    ",
      "786. Learned Attorney-General contends that  the delay in concluding hearing of the appeals is not  due to the laches of the State but it is, in fact, due to  the laches of the accused appellants. It is further  contended that most of the accused persons includ-  ing two appellants remained in abscondence  throughout the trial and the confirmation of the sen-  tence in the High Court Division and, as a result, the  lengthy procedures for hearing the reference in  absentia have been complied with. On perusal of the  record I noticed that no endeavour was ever taken on  the part of the appellants to dispose of the appeals  and the reference in the High Court Division. In this  Court also they did not take any step for early hear-  ing. It was the State which frequently prayed for fix-  ation of the hearing of the matters and on its prayer,  a Bench was constituted for hearing of the appeals.  The delay, in the premises, was not due to the lach-  es on the part of the State. Since the condemned  prisoners did not take any steps for hearing of the  death reference and their appeals at any point of  time, they cannot claim that they have been subject-  ed to “torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading  punislments or treatment” as a result of delay in car-  rying out sentences of death. Therefore, I find no  merit in the contention of the learned Counsels.  Normally this Court does not interfere with the dis-  cretion exercised by the High Court Division on the  question of sentence unless it is shown that the High  Court Division has disregarded the recognised prin-  ciples in imposing the sentence and there has been 4  failure of justice. The learned Sessions Judge has  assigned reasons for awarding the death sentence. It  has been observed that after the occurrence accused  appellants openly declared at home and abroad that                  they killed Bangabandhu and other members of his  that the incident was a barbarous one, they  brutally killed two newly married women and a child  aged below 10 years and the wife of Bangabandhu  who were not in any way involved in political activi-  ties, that they had committed the offence of murder  against humanity, that the killing was not harmful to  individual but it was a loss to the nation, and that  ite accused persons in a planned manner committed  the heinous crime with their knowledge of the conse-  quence, for which, they did not deserve any special  sympathy in awarding the sentence.    ",
      "785. In the case of Furman vs State of  Georigea, Nos. 69-5003, 69-5030 and 69-5031 in  the Federal Supreme Court of USA the Judges were  invited to reject capital sentence on the ground that  it violated the Eight Amendment which forbade  ‘cruel and unusual punishments’. Though the  leamed Judges by a majority set aside the sentence  of death, however, the three Judges namely Doug-  las, Stewart and White, JJ who formed majority with    Brennan and Marshall, JJ did not take the view  the Eight Amendment prohibited capital Punishmeny  for all crimes and under all circumstances, In our  Constitution there is no such provision like th ight  Amendment nor do we apply the test of reasonable.  ness with the freedom with which the Judges of  USA Supreme Court are accustomed to apply the  due process clause. We are dealing with punish,  ments for crimes as prescribed by law. This capita)  punishment cannot be termed as unusual because  this type of punishment has been with us from the  ancient times. Our Constitution recognised this pun-  ishment under the law.    ",
      "784. These principles are not applicable to our  Courts. The phrase ‘due process of law’ is synony-  mous with ‘law of the land’ as used in the famous  twenty-ninth chapter of ‘Magna Charta’ which  declared that “no freeman shall be taken, or impris-  oned, or dissiezed, or outlawed, or banished, or in  any way destroyed, nor will the king pass upon him  or commit him to prison, unless by the judgment of  his peers or the law of the land.” This principle has  been adopted in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-  ments of the American Constitution. Both these  amendments prohibit deprivation of life, liberty or  property ‘without due process of law’. The essence  of the concept is fairness and avoidance of arbitrari-  ness. These principles are being followed in Courts  of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, The Bahamas.  Article 31 of our Constitution like the American due  process clause ensures fair procedure in any pro-  ceeding affecting rights and liberties of individuals  and this fairness concept is embodied in the princi-  ples of natural justice. The American and Caribbean  decisions may throw light in making the inquiry, but  the standard set by those Courts cannot be applied to  our Courts without careful evaluation of our laws,  economic and social conditions and values. Second-  ly, there are uniform decisions of our Superior  Courts that mere delay is not a legal ground for the  commutation of a sentence of death.    ",
      "783. In Guerra’ case, the accused was con-  victed for murder in May, 1989 in Trinidad and  Tobago and was sentenced to death. He then applied  for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The tran-  script of summing up at the appellant's trial was  available in February 1990 but there was consider-  able delay in transcribing the Judge’s notes of evi-  dence and the appellant’s lawyer was not notified  that they were available in May, 1993. The appeal  was ultimately heard in October, 1993 which was  dismissed in November. The appellant’s petition for  leave to appeal to the Privy Council was also dis-  missed and his execution was fixed on the following  day. The appellant thereupon filed a constitutional  motion alleging that his execution the next day pur-  suant to the warrant would constitute a violation of  his fundamental rights. The motion was heard and  dismissed. Thereupon he appealed to the Privy  Council contending that his execution after a delay  of 4 years 10 months, during which time he was on  death row was a “cruel and unusual punishment”  contrary to section 5(2)(b) of the Constitution of  Trinidad and Tobago and that giving him less than  17 hours’ notice of his execution was a breach of his  constitutional rights. The Privy Council on applying  the principles of “due process law” under common  law jurisdiction commuted his sentence to imprison-  ment for life, on applying the principles of Prams  case as under:    “Where a person was sentenced to death in    a common law jurisdiction, execution was    required to be carried out by the State as swift-                  ly as practicable after sentence, allowing a rea-  sonable time for appeal and consideration of  nce under the common law a long-  ed execution was not in accordance with  the due process of law, In Trinidad and Tobago  such an execution, if not stayed, would consti-  tute a cruel and unusual punishment contrary to  section 5(2)(b) of the Constitution and would  not be in accordance with the due process of  law under section 4(a) of the Constitution.”    ",
      "782. In Henfield, the convict was sentenced to  death for murder in 1988. The Court of appeal of the  Commonwealth of The Bahamas dismissed his  appeal and a warrant was read for his execution. He  thereupon obtained stay of execution from the  Judicial Committee. His leave petition was dis-  missed by the Judicial Committee. Thereafter he  applied to the Supreme Court of the Bahamas for a  declaration that the period of time for which he had  been held awaiting execution amounted to such a  delay as to constitute inhuman punishment contrary  to Article 17(1) of the Constitution of the Common-  wealth of The Bahamas. There was delay for about  5 years in the disposal of the proceeding up to the    Supreme Court. Thereafter a warrant for execution  was issued, The convict thereupon applied to the  Judicial Committee for leave to appeal on the simi-  lar ground of “inhuman or degrading punishment or  other treatment”, The Privy Council following  Pratt’: case commuted the sentence of death to  imprisonment for life observing as follows:    “They therefore reviewed the relevant con-  siderations, at pp. 34-35, and concluded that in  any case in which execution was to take place  more than five years after sentence there would  be strong grounds for believing that the delay  was such that execution thereafter would con-  stitute inhuman punishment contrary to section  17(1)”.    ",
      "781. Pratt was convicted in Jamaica on a  charge of murder and sentenced to death. He applied  for leave to appeal within few days from his convic-  tion. There was delay of two years before hearing by  a Court of appeal of Jamaica of the application for  leave could be arranged due to delay in obtaining aid  and for other reasons. The appeal for leave was dis-  missed but no date was fixed for execution of sen-  tence. The rules in force in Jamaica laid down a  strict timetable for appeals to the Judicial Commit-  tee of the Privy Council and further provided that  execution would only be stayed so long as the time  table was adhered to, Furthermore, as per Jamaica’s  Constitution a written report of the case from the  trial Judge and the case record were required to be  submitted to the Jamaica Privy Council. Pratt wrote  to the Registrar of the Court of appeal asking for the  reasons why his application for leave to appeal was  dismissed. It had then transpired that no reasons  have been prepared because the papers have beet  misfiled and forgotten, The convict also petitioned  to the Inter American Human Rights for commula  tion of sentence. Then he applied to the United  Nations Human Rights Committee which requested                    Jamaica not to carry out death sentence before the  committee had an opportunity to consider the com-  plaint but in the meantime Jamaican Privy Council  recommended that the State not to accede to the  request Thereafter the accused also obtained an order  of stay of execution from the Governor General. In  this way there was delay of about 12 years for execu-  tion of the sentence. Thereupon Pratt petitioned for  Constitutional redress under section 25(1) of the  Constitution claiming that his execution after such a  prolonged delay “would be inhuman punishment or  other treatment” and thus in breach of section 17(1)  of the Constitution. The Privy Council accepted his  plea and commuted the sentence to imprisonment for life on the following reasons:    “prolonged delay in carrying out a sentence  of death after that sentence had been passed  could amount to inhuman punishment or other  treatment contrary to section 17(1) of the  Jamaican Constitution irrespective of whether  the delay was caused by the shortcomings of the  State or the legitimate resort of the accused to  all available appellate procedures. A State that  wished to retain capital punishment had to  accept the responsibility of ensuring that execu-  tion followed as swiftly as practicable after sen-  tence, allowing a reasonable time for appeal  and consideration of reprieve and, if the appel-  late procedure enabled the prisoner to prolong  the appellate hearings over a period of years,  the fault was to be attributed to the appellate  system that permitted such delay and not to the  prisoner who took advantage of it.”    ",
      "780. It is contended that since the appellants  have been in the death cell for a long period, the  ends of justice demands that the sentence awarded  to the appellants be commuted to imprisonment for  life, In this connection Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, has  referred the case of Nurul Hoque Kazi vs State 7  BLC (AD) 52. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun_ learneq  Counsel adds this prolonged delay in carrying our  sentence of death after their sentence had been  passed amounts to inhuman punishment and ton  and violative of fundamental rights guaranteed jr  Article 35(5) of the Constitution. According to the  learned Counsel, under this provision no person  shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or  degrading punishment or treatment, and on consid-  eration of their sufferings the sentence of death  awarded to these appellants is liable to be commut-  ed to imprisonment for life. In support of his con-  tention, the learned Counsel has referred the case of  Pratt vs Attorney-General for Jamaica (1993) 4 All  ER 768, Henfield vs Attorney-General of Common-  wealth of Bahamas, 3 WIR (PC) 1079 and Guerra vs  Baptiste (1995) 4 All ER 583.    ",
      "779. Therefore, in order to constitute the  offence of conspiracy, there must first be a combin-  ing together of two or more persons in the conspira-  cy; secondly, an act or illegal omission must take  place in pursuance of that conspiracy in order to the  doing of that thing. It is not necessary that the abet-  tor should concert the offence with the person who  commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the con-  spiracy in pursuance of which the offence is com-  mitted. Therefore, | find that each conspirator plays  his separate part in one integrated and united effort  to achieve the common purpose. The cumulative  effect of the proved circumstances should be taken  into account in determining the guilt of the accused  rather than adopting an isolated approach to each of  the circumstances. Each one is aware that he has a  part to play in a general conspiracy though he may  not know all its secrets or the means by which the  common purpose is to be accomplished. The com-  mon intention of the conspirators then is to work for    the furtherance of the common design. Mr Abdur  Razaque Khan finally argues that the act of Lieuten-  ant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan’s attracts  an offence of abetment of murder punishable under  section 109 of the Penal Code. In support of his con-  tention, the learned Counsel has referred the cases of  Md Shamsul Hoque vs State 20 DLR 540, Amor  Kumar Takur vs State 40 DLR (AD) 147, Hazrat Ali  vs State 44 DLR (AD)51 and Dharan Pal vs State of  Haryana (1978) 4 SCC 440. Md Shamsul Hoque’s  case was decided following the case in A/R 1935  Mad 130, which was also followed in 8 DLR 48. It  was observed in the Madras case that where an  offence is alleged to have been committed by two or  more persons, the person responsible for commis-  sion of the offence should be charged with the sub-  stantive offence, while the persons alleged to have  abetted it by conspiracy should be charged with the  offence of abetment under section 109. The views in  AIR 1938 Mad 130 have been overruled in Kandi-  malla Subbaiah’s case (AIR 1961 SC 1241 paras 7  and 8). The facts and the principles of law applica-  ble in Amar Kumar Thakur ’s case are quite distin-  guishable. In that case the accused were charged for  an offence punishable under sections 302/34, and  this Court on sifting evidence came to the conclu-  sion that “the appellant Nos.2-4 had no intention of  their own to cause the death of Nandalal particular-  ly when he was proceeding at their request to hold  the mediation at that unearthly hour of the night.” In  Hazrat Alis case, the Appellate Division on assess-  ment of the evidence came to the conclusion that  Hazrat Ali abetted the offence of the murder of  Zahura Khatun and converted his conviction to one  under sections 302/109 from an offence of sections  302/34. In Dharam Pal’ case, it was observed that  the existence or otherwise of the common intention  depends upon the facts and circumstances of each  case, and in the absence of materials, “the compan-  ion or companions cannot justifiably be held guilty  for every offence committed by the principal offend-  er.” These cases are quite distinguishable and not  applicable in this case. On an overall consideration  of the evidence and the principles of law discussed  above, I fully agree with the conclusion arrived by  the High Court Division that the appellants and  other convicts hatched up conspiracy to kill Banga-  bandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the members                    of his family and accomplished their object by  killing them and three other security personnel. Ina  case where the agreement is for accomplishment of  an act which constitutes an offence, then if the pros-  ecution fails to prove the overt act committed by  each of the conspirators, the criminal conspiracy is  established by proving such agreement and the  proof of overt act by all the accused would not be  necessary. In other words, in such situation it is not  required that each and every accused who is a party  to the conspiracy must do some overt act towards  the fulfilment of the object of conspiracy. In this  case, although an offence of murder has been com-  mitted in pursuance of conspiracy; the liability of  the conspirators for the conspiracy cannot disappear.  When specific act done by each of the accused have  been established showing their common intention,  they are admissible against each and every other  accused. In the case of Nalini [(1999) 5 SCC 253]  the accused persons were arraigned as members of  the conspiracy to extirpate former Prime Minister of  India Rajiv Gandhi. The accused persons were con-  victed under sections 302/120B of the Indian Penal  Code. Their conviction was maintained by the  Supreme Court. Similarly, in Kehar Singh’ case,  (AIR 1988 SC 1883), Kehar Singh, Balbir Singh and  Satwant Singh were charged under section 302 read  with section 120B and other offences for the assas-  sination of Smt. Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister  of India by her security guards. The conviction of  the two accused was maintained by the Supreme  Court. In Suresh Chandra Bahri’ case (AIR 1994  SC 2420) the Supreme Court of India maintained the  conviction of three accused under sections 302/  120B of the Penal Code. On consideration of the  evidence on record and the principles of law dis-  cussed above, | am of the view that the proper con-  viction of the appellants Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel. Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Artillery), Major AKMMohiuddin Ahmed  and Major Bazlul Huda would have been under sec-  tion 302 read with section 120B and section 34 of  the Penal Code instead of sections 302/34 and sec-  tion 120B of the Penal Code, and that of Lieutenant  Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan under sections  302/120B of the Penal Code. Their conviction is  modified accordingly. Confirmation of sentence.    ",
      "778. Ina later case in Suresh Chandra Bahri  vs Gurbachan Singh AIR 1994 SC 2420, Suresh  Bahri Bachan and Raj Pal Sharma were convicteg  under section 302 of the Penal Code-they were also  convicted under sections 302/120B for committing  murder of three persons in pursuance of the offence  of criminal conspiracy. Two of them were also con.  victed under section 201 for causing disappearance  of evidence. The Patna High Court maintained the  sentence of death. In the Supreme Court it was  argued that there is no direct and legal evidence  against Gurbachan and Raj Pal for their involvement  in the conspiracy and that there is no evidence against  Gurbachan about his participation in the crime. In the  context of the matter, the Supreme Court while main-  taining the conviction under sections 302/120B of the  accused on the basis of circumstantial evidence con-  sidered whether such conviction can be given in pur-  suance of criminal conspiracy. It is said that the pro-  visions of section 120A of the Penal Code defines  criminal conspiracy. It provides that when two or  more persons agree to do, or cause to be done (1) an  illegal act, or (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal  means, such agreement is designated a criminal con-  spiracy; provided that no agreement except an agree-  ment to commit an offence shall amount to criminal  conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is  done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof. Thus a cursory look to the provisions contained in section 120A reveal that a criminal conspiracy envisages an agreement between two or more persons to commit an illegal act or an act which by itself may not be illegal but the same is   done or executed by illegal means. The essential ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit an offence. In a case where the agreement is for accomplishment of an act which by itself constitutes an offence, then in that event no overt act is necessary to be proved by the prosecution because in such a fact situation criminal conspiracy is established by proving such an agreement. In other words, where the conspiracy alleged is with regard to commission of a serious crime of the nature as contemplated in section 120B read with the proviso to subsection (2) of section 120A, Penal Code, then in that event mere proof of an agreement between the                  accused for commission of such a crime alone is  enough to bring about a conviction under section  120B and the proof of any overt act by the accused  by any one of them would not be necessary.  Faizan  Uddin, J on consideration of almost all earlier deci-  sions on the point argued as under:    “The provisions in such a situation do not  require that each and every person who is a  party to the conspiracy must do some overt act  towards the fulfilment of the object of conspir-  acy, the essential ingredient being an agreement  between the conspirators to commit the crime  and if these requirements and ingredients are  established the act would fall within the trap-  ping of the provisions contained in section  120B since from its very nature a conspiracy  must be conceived and hatched in complete  secrecy, because otherwise the whole purpose  may frustrate and it is common experience and  goes without saying that only in very rare cases  one may come across direct evidence of a crim-  inal conspiracy to commit any crime and in  most of the cases it is only the circumstantial  evidence which is available from which an  inference giving rise to the conclusion of an  agreement between two or more persons to  commit an offence may be legitimately drawn.”    ",
      "777. Criminal conspiracy, as defined in sec-  tion 120A, consists of an agreement to do an illegal  act or an agreement to do an act which is not illegal  by illegal means. Section 120B provides that who-  ever is a party to a conspiracy to commit an offence  punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rig-  orous imprisonment for a term of two years or  upwards shall be punishable in the same manner as  if he has abetted such offence unless there was an  express provision in the Code for the punishment of  such conspiracy. JR Mudholkar, J speaking for the  Supreme Court argued as under:    “Criminal conspiracy was, however, not an  unknown thing before the amendment of the  Indian Penal Code in 1913. But what the amend-  ment did was to make that conspiracy itself pun-  ishable. The idea was to prevent the commission  of crimes by, so to speak, nipping them in the  bud. But it does not follow that where crimes  have been committed the liability to punishment  already incurred under section 120B by having  entered into a criminal conspiracy is thereby  wiped away. No doubt, as already stated, where  offences for committing which a conspiracy was  entered into have actually been committed it may  not, in the particular circumstances of a case, be  desirable to charge the offender both with the  conspiracy and the offences committed in pur-  suance of that conspiracy, But that would be a  matter ultimately within the discretion of the  Court before which the trial takes place.”    ",
      "776. In the State of Andhra Pradesh vs  Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao, AIR 1963 SC1850,  similar points arose. It is said that the offence of  conspiracy is an entirely independent offence and  though other offences are committed in pursuance  of the conspiracy the liability of the conspirators for  the conspiracy itself cannot disappear. In the Penal  Code, as originally enacted, conspiracy was not an  offence. Section 120B which makes criminal con-  spiracy punishable was added by the Criminal Law  Amendment Act, 1913 (Act VIII of 1913) along  with section 120A. Section 120A defines conspiracy  and section 120B provides for the punishment for  the offence of conspiracy.    ",
      "775. The next question is, whether a convic-  tion on the charge of conspiracy could have been  given after the conspiracy has borne its fruits as  raised by Mr Abdur Razaque Khan. In State of  Ahdhra Pradesh vs Kandimalla Subbaiah IR 1961  SC 1241, the point for consideration was whether an  offence is said to have been committed in conse-  quence of abetment, when it has been committed in  pursuance of the conspiracy, and the abettor by con-  spiracy can be made punishable with the punish-  ment provided for the actual offence. The Supreme  Court of India argued the point as under:    “Conspiracy to commit an offence is itself  an offence and a person can be separately  charged with respect to such a conspiracy.  There is no analogy between section 120B and  section 109, IPC There may be an element of  abetment in a conspiracy; but conspiracy is  something more than an abetment. Offences  created by sections 109 and 120B, IPC are quite  distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the  prosecution to only one element of conspiracy,  that is, abetment, when the allegation is that  what a person did was something over and  above that. Where a number of offences are  committed by several persons in pursuance of a  conspiracy it is usual to charge them with those  offences as well as with the offence of conspir-  acy to commit those offence.”                  ",
      "774. In Noor Md Yusuf Momin (Supra), the  distinctive features of sections 34, 107 and 120B are  explained. It is said that so far as section 34 of the  Penal Code is concerned, it embodies the principle  of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act, the  essence of that liability being the existence of a  common intention, Participation in the commission  of the offence in furtherance of the common inten-  tion invites its application. Section 109 of the Penal  Code, on the other hand, may be attracted even if the  abettor is not present when the offence abetted is  committed provided that he has instigated the com-  mission of the offence or has engaged with one or  more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an  offence and pursuant to that conspiracy some act or  illegal omission takes place or has intentionally  aided the commission of an offence by an act or ille-  gal omission on a charge under section 120B of the  Penal Code. An offence of criminal conspiracy was  made a substantive offence in 1913 by the introduc-  tion of Chapter V-A in the Penal Code. ID Dua, J  spoke for the Supreme Court as under:    “Criminal conspiracy postulates an agree-    ment between two or more persons to do, or  cause to be done, an illegal act or an act which  is not illegal, by illegal means, It differs from  other offences in that mere agreement is made  an offence even if no step is taken to carry out  that agreement. Though there is close associa-  tion of conspiracy with incitement and abet-  ment the substantive offence of criminal con-  spiracy is somewhat wider in amplitude than  abetment by conspiracy as contemplated its  very nature is generally hatched in secret. It is,  therefore, extremely rare that direct evidence in  proof of conspiracy can be forthcoming from    wholly disinterested quarters or from. utter  strangers. But, like other offences, criminal  spiracy can be proved by circumstanti:  dence, Indeed, in most cases proof of conspira-  cy is largely inferential though the inference  must be founded on solid facts, Surrounding  circumstances and antecedent and subsequent  conduct, among other factors, constitute rele-  vant material. In fact, because of the difficulties  in having direct evidence of criminal conspira-  cy, once reasonable ground is shown for believ-  ing that two or more persons have conspired to  commit an offence then anything, done by any-  one of them in reference to their common inten-  tion after the same is entertained becomes,  according to the law of Evidence, relevant for  proving both conspiracy and the offences com-  mitted pursuant thereto, ”    ",
      "773. Sub-section (1) of section 120B imposes  a penalty equal to the punishment for abetment on  participation in criminal conspiracy to commit an  offence. The section appears to have been intro-  duced to fill up the gap in section 107 defining  abetment- Under section 107 “secondly” provides  that a person abets the doing of a thing who engages  with others in a conspiracy for doing of that thing if  an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of  that conspiracy. Abetment of an offence is punish-  able under sections 109 and 116 as the case maybe.  if the offence is not committed; but it is clear that 2  conspiracy will not amount to an abetment unless an  act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of  the conspiracy. Therefore, the first class of cases  which section 120B is designed to cover, is that in  which the conspiracy is formed for the commission  of a serious offence. But no act or illegal omission  has taken place in presence of it. Put very briefly, the  distinction between the offence of abetment under  the second clause of section 107 and that of criminal  conspiracy under section 120 A is this, in the former  offence a mere combination of persons or agreement  between them is not enough. An act or illegal omis-  sion must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy  and in order to the doing of the thing conspired for:  in the latter offence the mere agreement is enough,  if the agreement is to commit an offence. In pur-  Suance of the criminal conspiracy if the conspirators  ‘commit several offences, then all of them will be  liable for the offences even if some of them had not  actively participated in the commission of the  offences. It is not required to prove that each and  every person who is a party to the conspiracy must                    do some overt act towards the fulfilment of the  object of conspiracy, the essential ingredient being  an agreement between the conspirators to commit  the crime since from its very nature a conspiracy is  hatched in secrecy, direct evidence of a criminal  conspiracy to commit a crime is not available other-  wise the whole purpose may  frustral  cases only the circumstantial evidence which is  available from which an inference giving rise to the  commission of an offence of conspiracy may be  legitimately drawn,    ",
      "772. Section 120A which defines criminal  conspiracy enacts that an agreement to commit an    offence may itself amount to a    criminal conspiracy    even if no overt act follows on the agreement. The  second class of cases is that in which the Conspiracy    is formed in order to do an illegal act or an act rot  illegal by illegal means; this sort of conspiracy in no  case amounts to abetment and does not amount ty  criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the    agreement is done in pursuance thereof. It is thy    clear that section 120A provides the extended deg.  nition of criminal conspiracy covering acts which dp,  not amount to abetment by conspiracy within th.  meaning of section 107; Section 120B provides pun-  ishment for criminal conspiracy where no exp  provision is made in the Penal Code for the pu  ment of such conspiracy.    ",
      "771. There is no substantial difference bet-  ween conspiracy as defined in section 120A and act-  ing on a common intention as contemplated in sec-  tion 34. In the former the gist for the offence is bare  agreement and association to break law even though  illegal act does not follow while the gist of an  offence under section 34 is the commission of a cri-  minal act in furtherance of a common intention of all  the offenders which means that there should be a  unity of criminal behaviour resulting in something  for which an individual will be punishable if it is  done by himself alone. When a criminal conspiracy  for committing murder has been established there is  no need to award a conviction in the aid of section  34 for, in an offence of criminal conspiracy anything  said, done or written in reference to their common  intention afier the intention was entertained is rele-  vant against all the accused. When specific acts  done by each of the accused have been established  showing their common intention they are admissible  against each and every other accused. Though an act  or action of one accused cannot be used as evidence  against other accused but an exception has been  carved out in section 10 of the Evidence Act in case  of criminal conspiracy, If there is reasonable ground  to believe that two or more persons have conspired  together in the light of the language used in 120A of  the Penal Code, the evidence of acts done by one of  the accused can be used against the other.    ",
      "770. The Supreme Court explained the princi-  ples of joint liability observing that mere distance  from the scene of crime cannot exclude culpability  under section 34 of the Penal Code in criminal shar-  ing making out a certain measure of jointness in the  commission of the act. The learned Judges failed to  appreciate the ratio decidendi of this decision and                  applied it in this case which is not applicable in the  facts and circumstances of this case, | do not dispute  the principle of law stated and considered by the High  Court Division eases and those are settled principles.  The prosecution is required to prove the physical  presence of the accused persons at the place of occurrence in order to bring them within the ambit of section 34 of the Penal Code because the common intention to commit an offence of physical violence develops at the spot. Even if it is assumed that section 34 is not applicable in respect of Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, this would, however, be of little practical benefit to him because his participation in the criminal conspiracy to implement the object has been established by the prosecution.    ",
      "769. The application of section 34 in respect  of the offences other than physical violence have  been explained in Tukaram Ganpat’s case (AIR  1974 SC 514). The facts against the accused includ-  ing the appellant Tukaram Ganpat were that they  stole some bundles of copper wire from the godown  of a company after breaking open the godown and  removed them away by a lorry which stopped at a  weigh-bridge where the brokers for sale were pres-  ent. There was no evidence about the presence of the  appellant at the scene of offence. The concurrent’    findings of the Courts below were that the appellant  was in possession of duplicate keys of the burgled  godown found missing from the factory and that he  was present at the weigh bridge, The appellant had  no explanation for possessing of godown keys nor  for his presence at weigh-bridge. In the context of  the matter the Supreme Court maintained the con-  Viction of the appellant on applying the principles of  common intention as under:    “Mere distance from the scene of crime  cannot exclude culpability under section 34  which lays down the rule of joint responsibility  for a criminal act performed by a plurality of  persons. In Barendra Kumar Ghosh vs King  Emperor (1924) 52 IA 40 = (AIR 1925 PC 1)  the Judicial Committee drew into the criminal  net those ‘who only stand and wait.’ This does  not mean that some form of presence, near or  remote, is not necessary, or that mere presence  without more, at the spot of crime, spells culpa-  bility. Criminal sharing, overt or covert by  active presence or by distant direction, making  out a certain measure of jointness in the com-  mission of the act is the essence of section 34.  Even assuming that presence at the scene is a  pre-requisite to attract section 34 and that such  propinquity is absent. section 107 which is dif-  ferent in one sense, still comes into play to rope  in the accused. The act here is not the picking  the godown lock but housebreaking and crimi-  nal house trespass. This crime is participated in  by those operating by remote control as by  those doing physical removal. Together operat-  ing in concert, the criminal project is executed.  Those who supply the duplicate key, wait at the  weigh bridge for the break-in and bringing of  the booty and later secrete the keys are par-  ticipes criminis. And this is the role of accused  No.2 according to the Courts below. Could this  legal inference be called altogether untenable?    ",
      "768. 1 am not inclined to multiply the deci-  sions on this point any further. As observed above,  several persons can simultaneously attack a man and  each can have the same intention, namely the inten-  tion to kill and each can individually inflict a sepa-  rate fatal blow and yet none could be vicariously  convicted for the act of any of the others . Same or  similar intention should not be confused with com-  mon intention. Similarly, it should be borne in mind  that physical presence at the scene of occurrence is  necessary for a man can be vicariously liable for an  offence of physical violence since the essence of  common intention is simultaneous consensus of the  minds of persons participating in the criminal action  to bring about a particular result.    ",
      "767. In Noor Md Yusuf Momin vs State of  Maharastra, AIR 1971 SC 885, the trial Court con  victed Md Taki Haji Hussain Momin under section  302 and acquitted three other accused including the  appellant. On appeal against acquittal, the Bombay  High Court reversed the acquittal and convicted the  appellant and two others under section 120B and                  302 read with section 34, IPC The appellant was  also convicted under sections 302/109 IPC and sen-  tenced to imprisonment for life on two counts sepa-  rately. As there was no conclusive evidence about  the appellant's physical presence at the place of  occurrence, the Supreme Court gave him the benefit  of doubt of sharing common intention in the accom-  plishment of the object and acquitted him of the  charge under sections 302/34 on the following  observations:    “From the evidence it seems highly proba-  ble that at the time of the actual murder of Mohd.  Yahiya the appellant was either present with  other three co-accused or was somewhere near-  by. But this evidence does not seem to be enough  to prove beyond reasonable doubt his presence at  the spot in the company of the other accused  when the murder was actually committed ....:.+  we are, therefore, inclined to give to the appel-  lant the benefit of doubt in regard to the charge  under section 302 read with section 34, IPC.”    ",
      "766. Thus, the consistent views right from the  Privy Council to apex Courts of India, Pakistan and  Bangladesh are that in order to bring an offence  within the ambit of section 34, in respect of physical  violence, the offender must be physically present at  the actual commission of the crime for the purpose  of facilitating the offence. Even if the offender did  nothing but merely helped by his presence for facil-  itating the offence, he will be liable for joint liabili-  ty. In order to bring the offence within the ambit of  the section there must be simultaneous consensus of  minds of persons participating in the criminal action  to bring about a particular result, such consensus can  be developed at the spot.    ",
      "765. In the facts of the case the learned Judges  observed as follows:    “In offence involving physical violence,  normally presence at the scene of the occur-  rence of the offender sought to be rendered  liable on the principle of joint liability is neces-  sary such is not the case in respect of other  offences where offence consists of adverse acts  which may be done at different time and place.”    ",
      "764. In Tajul Islam's case (48 DLR 305), the  High Court Division noticed the evidence produced  by the prosecution in support of charge that Badshs  in his confession stated that he pressed the legs of  second son of Biroja Rani, and accused Inu cut him  into two pieces by a dao. Other confessing accused  stated that for the purpose of committing the offence  they went to the house of Biroja and were on guard  either in the boat or in front of the door of neigh-  bours of Biroja or in the road leading to the house of  Biroja presumably to prevent any person from com-  ing in the way of their committing the offence.    ",
      "763. In the facts of the case, H Rahman, CJ,  speaking for the Supreme Court observed:    “There is no doubt that to bring a case  within the ambit of section 34, PPC it is neces-  sary that some overt act or acts must be estab-  lished to lead to the inference that the participa-  tors in the crime acted in pre-concert or under  some pre-arranged plan but this does not mean  that every participant in the crime must be  shown to have committed the same kind of act.  It is sufficient to show that they joined together  in the commission of a particular act, for then  they must all be deemed to have intended the    natural and inevitable consequences of that act  even if some of them did nothing but merely  helped by their presence the commission Of the  act.” (emphasis added)    ",
      "762. The leamed second Judge also consid-  ered the case of Rasool Bux vs State 22 DLR (SC)  297, in which case the views taken in Barendra  Ghosh have been approved. In that case accused Lal  Bux and Rasul Bux abducted Mst Roshna from the  house of her father, if necessary, by the use of force.  They were both armed with deadly weapons. When  their presence was discovered in the Courtyard they  abandoned their original plan but were nevertheless  determined to escape, if necessary by use of  weapons carried by them.    ",
      "761. Five member Bench of this Court also  took similar views in Abdur Rahman Mondal’s case  [29 DLR (SC) 247] as follows :    “The common intention to bring about a  particular result may well develop on the spot  as between a number of persons. All that is nec-  essary is either to have direct proof of prior con-  cert or proof of circumstances which necessari-  ly lead to that inference or the incriminating  acts must be incompatible with the innocence of  the accused and incapable of explanation on  any other reasonable hypothesis. Further, it is  the essence of section 34 that the person must  be physically present at the actual commission  of the crime.” (emphasis added)    ",
      "760. In the case of Shocekantiah Ramayya  Munipalli vs State of Bombay, (AIR 1955 SC 287) it  was observed :    “The essence of section 34 that the person    must be physically present at the scene of  occurrence coupled with actual participation                  which, of course can be of a passive character  such as standing by a door, provided that is  done with the intention of consisting in further-  ance of common intention of them all and there  is a readiness to play his part in the prearranged  plan when the time comes for him to act”.  (emphasis given)    ",
      "759. These views have been approved in  Ramaswami Ayyangar s case (AIR 1976 SC 2027) as  under:    “The contention is fallacious and cannot be  accepted. Section 34 is to be read along with the  preceding section 33 which makes it clear that  the “act” spoken of in section 34 includes a  series of acts as a single act. It follows that the  words “when a criminal act is done by several  persons” in section 34, may be construed to  mean “when criminal acts are done by several  persons.” The acts committed by different con-  federates in the criminal action may be different  but all must in one way or the other participate  and engage in the criminal enterprise, for  instance, one may only stand guard to prevent  any person coming to the relief of the victim or  to otherwise facilitate the execution of the com-  mon design. Such a person also commits an  “act” as much as his co-participants actually  committing the planned crime. In the case of an  offence involving physical violence, however,  it is essential for the application of section .34  that the person who instigates or aids the com-  mission of the crime must be physically present  at the actual commission of the crime for the  purpose of facilitating or prompting the  offence, the commission of which is the aim of  the joint criminal venture. Such presence of  those who in one way or the other facilitate the  execution of the common design, is itself tanta-  mount to actual participation in the ‘criminal  act.’ The essence of section 34 is simultaneous  consensus of the minds of persons participating  in the criminal action to bring about a particular  result. Such consensus can be developed at the  spot and thereby intended by all of them.    (emphasis added)    ",
      "758. Therefore, the dominant feature of sec-    tion 34 is the element of participation in action, this  participation need not be in all cases by physical  presence. The Supreme Court of India in Jaikrishna-  das Monohardas Desai vs State of Bombay, AIR  1960 SC 889 has distinguished the cases in which  the physical presence of the accused person at the  place of incident is prerequisite and in which cases  the physical presence of the accused is not neces-  sary- his participation by doing separate acts similar  or diverse would bring him within the ambit of the  section. It has been observed as follows:    “But the essence of liability under section  34 is to be found in the existence of a common  intention animating the offenders leading to the  doing of a criminal act in furtherance of the  common intention and presence of the offender  sought to be rendered liable under section 34 is  not, on the words of the statute, one of the con-  ditions of its applicability. As explained by  Lord Summer in Barendra Kumar Ghose vs  Emperor, 52 In App 40 at p.52 (AIR 1925 PC 1  at p.7), the leading feature of section 34 of the  Indian Penal Code is ‘participation in action’.  To establish joint responsibility for an offence,  it must of course be established that a criminal  act was done by several persons; the participa-  tion must be in doing the act, not merely in its  planning. A common intention—a meeting of  minds—to commit an offence and participation  in the commission of the offence in furtherance  of that common intention invites the application  of section 34. But this participation need not in  all cases be by physical presence. In offences  involving physical violence, normally presence  at the scene of offence of the offenders sought  to be rendered liable on the principle of joint  liability may be necessary, but such is not the  case in respect of other offences where the  offence consists of diverse acts which may be    done at different times and places. (emphasis    added)    ",
      "757. As observed above, the dominant feature  of section 34 of the Penal Code is the element of  participation in actions. This participation need not  in all cases be by physical presence. Common inten-  tion implies acting in concert, This section requires  that there must be a general intention shared by all    the persons united with a common purpose to do any  criminal offence, all of those who assist in the  accomplishment of the object would be equally  guilty. It follows, therefore, that common intention  is an intention to commit a crime actually commit.  ted and everyone of the accused should have partic.  ipated in that intention. In Barendra Kumar Ghosh;  case, their Lordships of the Privy Council ha:  clearly expounded the principles animated in  section. In that case three men fired at the postmas-    ter, of whom Barendra Kumar, the appellant, was    one of them. He wore distinctive clothes by which    he could be identified; and while these men were    just inside the room, another was visible from the    room through the door standing close to the others  but just outside on the doorstep in the Courtyard.  This man was armed but did not fire. The defence of  Barendra was that he was the man outside the room,  that he stood in the Courtyard and was very much  frightened. It was observed that whether he was  present as one of the firing party or as its command-  er or as its reserve or its sentinel was of no special  importance on the case made for the Crown. Why he  was there at all and why he did not take himself off  again he did not say, nor did he even indicate his  precise position in the yard. Their Lordships while  maintaining his conviction expounded the ambit of  section 34 as follows:  <br>  “By section 33 a criminal act in section 34  includes a series of acts and, further “act  includes omission to act, for example, an omis-  sion to interfere in order to prevent a murder  being done before one’s very eyes. By section  37, when any offence is committed by means of  several acts whoever intentionally cooperates in  the commission of that offence by doing  one of those acts, either singly or jointly with  any other person, commits that offence. Even if  the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the  door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in  other things “they also serve who only stand  and wait.” By section 38 when several persons:  are engaged or concerned in the comm  a criminal act, they may be guilty of different  offences by means of that act. Read together  these sections are reasonably plain. section 3+  deals with the doing of separate acts, similar offense  , by several persons; if all are done in                    furtherance of a common intention, each person  is liable for the result of them all, as if he had    done them himself for “that act” and “the act”  in the latter part of the section must include the    whole action covered by “a criminal act” in the  first part, because they refer to it.” (emphasis  given)    ",
      "756. Major AKMMohiuddin (Lancer) brought  the President down for facilitating his killing. He  has actively participated in the act of killing.  Although Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rah-  man did not join in the actual killing but his pres-  ence at the main gate of Bangabandhu with a tank at  the time of killing was part of the agreement with a  view to attainment of the object which all the  accused persons were pursuing. Simil Lieuten-  ant Colonel Mohiuddin (artillery) aided co-accused  Major Bazlul Huda, Major AKM> Mohiuddin  (Lancer) and others in the attainment of the object  by his act of remaining present with troops and  artillery with the motive that if anybody come for-  ward to rescue the President, he would resist them,  and with that object, he fired four cannon-balls let-                    ting others know that he was prepared to use the  cannon- balls whenever time comes for him to act,  The acts of the: ‘cused persons lead to the con-  clusion unaffected by reasonable doubt that they  were parties to the conspiracy and guilty of criminal  conspiracy for killing Bangabandhu and other mem-  bers of his family. Their offence can also be spelt out  by applying the principle of constructive liability for  the offence of murder as they participated in the  ime in furtherance of common intention of all.  mittedly Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar  Rashid Khan was not present at the place of occur-  rence. He was deployed at the Radio Station at the  ¢ of occurrence. As observed above, his task was  also for preventing anyone from seeking any help by  sending message through the radio. Now the crux of  the point is whether his act falls within the ambit of  section 34 since he was not physically present at the  place of occurrence. The learned Judges of the High  Court Division were of the view that he shared the  common intention with other accused- persons,  although his participation was not active, it was pas-  sive, which act also attracted the ambit of section  34. The first learned Judge observed that “besides  being present at the night parade and his presence at  the Radio Station was part of the said agreement that  he entered into agreement with other convicts for  the purpose of causing the incident in the official  residence of the President”, The second learned  Judge also noticed his presence at the Radio Station  about 4-30/5-00 AM and expressed similar views.  The learned Judges considered the cases of Baren-  dra Kumar Ghose vs Emperor, AIR 1925 PC 1,  Shocekantiah Ramayya Muni Palli, vs State of  Bombay AIR 1955 SC 287, Takaram Gonapat vs  State of Maharashtra AIR 1974 SC 514, Rama-  swami vs State of TN, AIR 1976 SC 2027, Abdur  Kahman Mandol vs State , 29 DLR (SC)247,  Bangladesh vs Abed Ali, 36 DLR (AD) 234, Abdus  Samad @ AKM Abdus Samad vs State 44 DLR (AD)  233 and State vs Tajul Islam 48 DLR 305 in coming  to their conclusion.    ",
      "755. The acts of the appellants and co-accused  that they took control of vital points was a part of the  criminal conspiracy to fulfil the common design of  killing Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and  his family members without any interruption. There  is no dispute that Major Bazlul Huda and Major  Mohiuddin (Lancer) actively participated in the  killing, of them, Major Bazlul Huda shot to death  Sheikh Kamal and the President. His act attracts sec-  tion 302 but he has been charged under sections  302/34 of the Penal Code. His conviction cannot be  converted to one under section 302 for the substan-  tive offence.    ",
      "754. They proved that Lieutenant Colonel  Mohiuddin (artillery) was deputed with cannons at  Kalabagan play ground near road No, 32, Lieutenant  Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan was deputed  at the Radio Station, Lieutenant Colonel Faruque  Rahman took the overall responsibility for checking  Rakhibahani and the Bangabandhu’s house, Major  Mohiuddin (lancer), Major Bazlul Huda, Major  Noor with some troops were given the task of imple-  menting the main object the killing of the President  and other members of his family.    ",
      "753. Let us now apply these principles to the  facts of the present case. As observed above, these  appellants attended in the night parade, and it was  organised to fulfil and implement their object. They  deployed jawans under the command of the officers  at different key points such as, Rakhibahani head-  quarter, BDR headquarter, Radio Station, Minto  Road. and Road No. 32. This deployment of army at  Rakhibahini headquarter gate and BDR gate was a  part of their preconcerted plan to prevent these para-  military forces if they came forward for protecting  the President on getting any information for help.  The deployment at the Radio Station was for pre-  venting any person on behalf of the then Govern-  ment to seek any help from the army, navy, air force,  paramilitary forces, political activists or from other  sources. The deployment at Minto Road was also to  prevent the Ministers to mobilise the public or any  other force for the protection of the President. The  existence of the conspiracy and its objects have to be  inferred from the circumstances and the conduct of  the accused. The principles governing circum-  stances so proved must form a chain of events from  which the only irresistible conclusion about the guilt  of the accused can safely be drawn and on the  hypothesis against the guilt is possible (1977 SCC  (Cri) 1004]. The circumstances before, during and  after the occurrence can be proved to decide about  the complicity of the accused. In Nalini case  [(1999)5 SCC 253] Wadha, J pointed out the crimi-  nal responsibility for a conspiracy requires more or  less passive attitude towards an existing conspiracy.  Learned Judge set out the legal position as under:    “One who commits an overt act with  knowledge of the conspiracy is guilty. And one  who tacitly consents to the object of conspiracy  and goes along with other conspirators actually  standing by while others put the act into effect,  is guilty though he intends to take no active part  in the crime.”    ",
      "752. A criminal intention within the meaning  of section 34 is simultancous contentious of the  minds of persons participated in the criminal action  to bring such particular result if one facilitates the  execution of the common design; such person com-  mits an act as much as his co-participants actually  committing the planned crime. The essence of the  section is that the person must be physically present  at the actual commission of the crime. This must be  coupled with actual participation, which may be of  passive character such as standing by a door or near  about the incident with the intention of assisting in  furtherance of common intention of all the accused  and with a readiness to play his part when the time  comes for him to act.    ",
      "751. This would not be the case if the offence  is committed with a common intention or each  accused posses the necessary intention or knowl-  edge. Section 38 provides for different degrees of  responsibility arising from the same kind of act. The  illustration brings out the point clear :    A attacks Z under such circumstances of  grave provocation that his killing of Z would be  only culpable homicide not amounting to mur-  der. B having ill-will towards Z and intending  to kill him, and not having been subject to the  provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though  A and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death,  B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of  culpable homicide.                  ",
      "750. A reading of these provisions show that  sections 34 and 35 create responsibility for the total  result while section 38 creates individual responsi-  bility only. Section 34 applies where there is a com-  mon intention and for a criminal act done in further-  ance of common intention of all, everyone is equal-  ly responsible. Section 35 requires the existence of  the knowledge or intent in each accused before he  can be held liable if knowledge or intent is necessary  to make the act criminal. Thus if two persons beat a  Third, one intends to cause his death and the other to  cause only grievous injury and there is no common  intention, their offences will be different.    ",
      "749. To meet the points raised, I would like to  discuss the true purports of section 34 which should  be considered along with sections 35 and 38 of the  Penal Code, which read as follows:  <br>  “34, When a criminal act is done by S€Vera}  persons, in furtherance of the common intention  of all, cach of such persons is liable for that acy  in the same manner as if it were done by him  alone.  <br>  35, Whenever an act, which is criminal onjy  by reason of its being done with a criminal  knowledge or intention, is done by several per.  sons, each of such persons who joins in the ag  with such knowledge or intention is liable for the  act in the same manner as if the act were done by  him alone with that knowledge or intention.  <br>  38. Where several persons are engaged or  concerned in the commission of a criminal act,  they may be guilty of different offences by  means of that act.”    ",
      "748. Now turing to the charge of murder, it is  contended by the learned Counsels that there is no  legal evidence on record in support of the charge  under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against the  appellants. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman argues that  there is no nexus. between the deployment of  artillery troops at Kalabagan play ground by the  appellant Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery) and the  killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh’ Mujibur Rahman  and therefore, he has been illegally convicted under  sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. Mr Khan Saifur  Rahman, further contended that if the offence com-  mitted is found to be a mutiny which being a mili-  tary offence, section 34 or section 38 has no manner  of application in this case. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan  argued that Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid  Khan was not present at or about the place of occur-  rence and in the absence of any overt act or his par-  ticipation in the incident of killing with the other  accused persons, his conviction under sections 302/  34 is totally illegal and baseless. Mr Khan strenu-  ously argued that in order to bring the appellant  Shahriar Rashid Khan within the ambit of section 34  of the Penal Code some overt act or acts relating to  the incident must be established to lead to the infer-  ence that he had participated with the perpetrators of  the crime in a pre-concerted or pre-arranged manner.  Learned Counsel further-argued that this appellant's  presence at the Radio Station at or around 6-00 AM  on 15th August after the occurrence was part of his  official duty, for which, he could not be saddled with  the charge of murder.    ",
      "747. The evidence of these witnesses proved  that the appellants and other co-accused, as part of  their premeditated plan arranged night parade and  then came out from the cantonment with their troops  armed with tanks, cannons and other arms, to the  house of Bangabandhu situated at Road No. 32, and  killed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and  family members, and after the killing they com-  pelled the Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force to  express their allegiance of the killing and to accept  Khondker Mustaque Ahmed as the President of the  country. Thereafter they stayed at Bangabhaban,  guarded Khondker Mustaque Ahmed and the Radio  Station so that anybody could topple him. They  attended the oath taking ceremonies of the President  and the Cabinet although they were not supposed to  be present at such national ceremonies. Lieutenant  Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan was a removed offi-  cer but he was seen at the night parade and then at  the Radio Station in the early hours of 15th August.  He was also found present at Bangabhaban with  other accused at the state ceremony after the car-  nage. Some of the accused arranged for burying the  dead bodies. All these circumstances sufficiently  proved that they were involved in the killing of  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and other  members of his family. These conducts of the  accused persons are relevant under section 8 of the  Evidence Act and may be taken as corroborative  evidence for furnishing further proof of their guilt.                  These previous and subsequent conducts of the  accused appellants played an important part in the  determination of their guilt and could be taken as  circumstantial evidence. All these evidence suffi-  ciently proved beyond doubt that these appellants  and other convicts were involved in the camage of  Sth August 1975, and the learned Judges of the  High Court Division were perfectly justified in find-  ing them guilty of the charges and accepting the  death reference,    ",
      "746. The Third learned Judge disbelieved PW    60 who proved Exhibits 10/5, 35, 10/5/A about the    absorption and deployment of the accused persons    in the Foreign Embassies on the reasonings that this    absorption could not be taken as reward of their    involvement in the carnage of 15th August and that    no adverse presumption could be drawn against the  accused by reason of such employment. The Third  leamed Judge erred in law in failing to consider that  there is uncontroverted evidence on record that after  Ziaur Rahman assuming power from Khandaker  Mustaque Ahmed absorbed their services in the  Foreign Ministry and posted most of the accused  persons at different Embassies of Bangladesh and  that unless they were not involved in the occurrence,  there was no reason for their being absorbed in the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some of them were    removed officers. PWs 44 and 47 proved that they  were absorbed by General Ziaur Rahman after he  came to power on 7th March 1975 and that they left  the country on the evening of 3rd March when  Khondker Mustaque Ahmed was dethroned by  Khaled Mosharraf. The accused did not deny those  facts. There is nexus between the accused persons’  fleeing away from the country on 3rd November and  their absorption in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  after Ziaur Rahman assumed power on 7th Novem-  ber, and in the intervening period Khaled Mosharraf  was in power. The Third learned Judge without  properly appreciating the evidence of PWs 44, 45  and 47 disbelieved PW 60. If the evidence of those  witnesses are read together no inference could be  drawn other than that the killers of Bangabandhu  were rewarded by General Ziaur Rahman after he  assumed power on 7th November, 1975.    ",
      "745. The first learned Judge also disbelieved  PW 46 about his identification of the appellants  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieu-  tenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan, Major Bazlul  Huda and other accused at Bangabhaban on the rea-  soning that there was nothing on evidence that he  knew them earlier. This finding of the learned Judge  is inconsistent, inasmuch as, the learned Judge him-  self took exception about these appellants’ presence  at Bangabhaban on the occasion of the oath taking  ceremony of the President and made adverse pre-  sumption that they being junior army officers were  not supposed to remain present at Bangabhaban in  the President’s oath taking ceremony. PWs 15 and  47 also deposed that they saw them at Bangabhaban.  Therefore, the learned second Judge has rightly  believed this witness.    ",
      "744. The first leamed Judge disbelieved PW  24 on the reasoning that in course of cross-examina-  tion on behalf of Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman he stated that he deposed as per version of  the police against the accused on the apprehension  that he would be made an accused in the case as he  was present at Serniabat’s house. The second  learned Judge, however, believed him on the rea-  sonings that on perusal of his statement in its entire-  ty in cross would suggest that he denied the sugges-  tion but the leamed Sessions Judge recorded his  statement in the positive form inadvertently . He.  however, denied the almost similar suggestion made  on behalf of Lieutenant’ Colonel Mohiuddin  (artillery). In view of the difference in opinion                  regarding the veracity of this witness we have ven-  tured to assess his evidence afresh in entirety. This  witness deposed in Court on 19th October, 1997  after more than 22 years of the occurrence and at  this belated stage, there was no occasion on his part  to harbour any apprehension of being implicated in  Serniabat's murder case since the case was already  filed long ago. He made this statement in Court and  not before the police. In view of the above, I fully  agree with the views of the second learned Judge  that the learned Sessions Judge inadvertently  recorded the suggestion in affirmative although he  denied the suggestion    ",
      "743. PW 45 stated that he saw Major Bazlul  Huda, Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Ahmed and other  co-accused at the oath taking ceremony of Khond-  ker Mustaque Ahmed as President, at Bangabhaban.  PW 46 stated that he saw Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar  Rashid Khan, Major Bazlul Huda and other accused  persons were sitting beside Khondker Mustaque  Ahmed, who was sitting on the President’s chair on  15th August at about 3-30 PM at Bangabhaban. PW  47 also saw Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan,  Major Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Major Bazlul Huda  at the oath taking ceremony of the then President  and the Cabinet on 15th August. He further stated  that after the incident of 3rd November, Lieutenant  Colonel Rashid and other accused persons left for  Bangkok. These officers are junior army officers  and some of them were removed officers including  Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar. They were not sup-  posed to remain present at such state level ceremo-  ny unless they were not involved in the killing of the  President. These facts suggested that they were  involved in the occurrence. There is corroborative  evidence of PWs 44 and 47 that the appellants and  other accused persons left the country and took shel-  ter in Bangkok after the incident of 3rd November,    1975. It is also an admitted fact that Khandake  Mustaque Ahmed assumed the office of Presiden,  after the death of Bangabandhu. There is also cor.  roborative evidence on record that the appellants  and other accused were found in the company op  Khandaker Mustaque at Bangabhaban. According,  the prosecution, the accused persons as a part of  their conspiracy made Khandaker Mustaque as  President to fulfil their purpose although as per pro.  visions of the Constitution, he was not supposed to  become the President of the country. The appellants’  presence at the Radio Station and Bangabhaban  after the occurrence and their fleeing away from the  country jointly after the incident of 3rd November  1975 when Khandaker Mustaque Ahmed was  dethroned, supported the prosecution case that they  fled from the country for the fear of being prosecut-  ed for the killing. The fact of fleeing away from the  country of the appellants jointly is a relevant fact to  connect them in the occurrence. Otherwise there  was no reason for them to leave the country jointly.  It is also a relevant fact that most of these accused  persons have been absorbed in the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and posted at Foreign Embassies.  They did not deny these facts. PW 49 stated that on  1Sth August Major Dalim introduced him with  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman: after  broadcasting the statements of allegiance by the  Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force in the Radio  Station. PW 60 proved the absorption of the accused  persons in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 8th  June, 1976 in pursuance of the Army Headquarter’s  letter under Memo, dated 15th August, 1976.    ",
      "742. . PW 23 stated that after the incident he  did not see Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rah-  man and Major Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) in the  unit and then he heard that they were staying at  Bangabhaban after the incident of killing. PW. 24  stated that immediately after killing of Minister  Serniabat and members of his family, he saw while  Major Dalim, Major Noor, Major Shahriar and other  accused were entering into the Radio Station. PW 37  stated that after the incident he saw Lieutenant  Colonel Shahriar and other accused were preparing  speech of Khondker Mustaque on 15th August 1975,  at 7-00 AM at the studio No.2 of the Radio Station.  PW 42 made unison statement and stated that he  found Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan,  Major Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer) and Faruque  Rahman in the Radio Station on 15th August when  the Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force came there  to express their allegiance through the radio, He fur-  ther stated that he also found Major Bazlul Huda  and Major Noor when he went to Road No.32 an  15th August at 11-00 AM for taking pictures of the  victims as per direction of the authority, He further  stated that he also saw Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar                  Rashid Khan, Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman,  Major Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer) and other accused  persons in the President's room at Bangabhaban in  the afternoon on 15th August, PW 44 stated that  while the officers involved in the killing of 15th  August and 3rd November, 1975 were staying in  Bangkok, the “sepahi biplob” (armed revolution)  occurred on 7th November, 1975, that Major  General Ziaur Rahman became the absolute leader  and that after assuming power, he repatriated the  officers involved in the killing of 15th August and  3rd November by arranging their services at differ-  ent Foreign Embassies of Bangladesh. This state-  ment proved that after the incident of 3rd Novem-  ber, the officers involved in the killing of 15th  August left this country and took shelter in  Bangkok. He further stated that those officers made  abortive attempt to revolt against Ziaur Rahman and  thereafter, they were removed from the service and  then they lived abroad as fugitives. The appellants  did not challenge the statements of this witness.    ",
      "741. PWs 8, 9, 12,15, 16, 20, 23, 24, 37, 42,  44, 45, 46, 47,49 and 60 deposed in support of the  subsequent conduct of the appellants. PW 8 stated  that as per direction of commanding officer Lieu-  tenant Colonel Motiur Rahman to report about the  condition of Bangabandhu’s house, he along with  two officers visited Bangabandhu’s house on 15th  August 1975 and at the gate Major Noor and Major  Bazlul Huda received them, He further stated that  Major Bazlul Huda admitted his complicity in the  killing over which I have discussed earlier, PW:9  went to the Bangabandhu’s house as per direction of    PW 45 on 1Sth August at about 3 PM for ascertain-  ing the condition prevailing in that house, when  Major Bazlul Huda received him at the gate of  Bangabandhu's house. This witness further stated  that under the supervision of Major Mohiuddin, the  dead body of Bangabandhu was sent to Tongipara  through a helicopter. PW 12 stated that he saw  Lieutenant Colenel Syed Faruque Rahman while he  was coming towards Mirpur Road from Road No.32  with a tank at 7-15 AM on 15th August. PW 15 saw  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,  Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan, Major  Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer) at  Bangabhaban on the day of occurrence at about 4-00  PM. PW 16 saw Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman on a jeep while he was approaching  towards south of the house of Bangabandhu in front  of Shang Hai Restaurant, Kalabagan, Mirpur Road  on 15th August in the morning. Thereafter he went  to Bangabhaban and saw Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Artillery) with his troops. PW 20 saw Lieutenant  Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and other officers  inside Bangabhaban after the occurrence.    ",
      "740. PW 34 recognised Lieutenant Colonel    Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) at Kalabagan. PW 35  recognised Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Amtllery) and Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman  at the night parade ground. PW 39 recognised Lieu-  tenant Colonel Faruque Rahman and Major Mohi-  uddin Ahmed (Lancer) at the night parade ground.  PW 40 stated that Faruque told him that they were  moving to topple the autocratic Government, but  instead of toppling the Government, they killed the  President and other members of his family. I have  discussed their evidence in detail while considering  the charge of criminal conspiracy. The appellants  along with co-accused and their troops marched  from the parade ground towards the key points, took  control of those key points by deploying troops with  arms and ammunition and then their object was  materialised. There is continuity of purpose or  design and continuity of action, the different acts of  the accused may be regarded as parts of the same  transaction. The offence of conspiracy and acts done  in pursuance of the conspiracy form one and the  same transaction. These conducts of the appellants  are relevant which have no reasonable explanation  other than their guilt.    ",
      "739. The prosecution has proved the previous  conduct of the accused appellants by examining  PWs11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 32,  34, 35, 39 and 40. PW 11 recognised Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Major Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Lancer), and. Major Bazlul Huda at the  night parade, PW 12 recognised Major Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Lancer), Lieutenant Colonel Faruque  Rahman and Major Huda at the night parade on 14th  August. PW 13 recognised Major Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Lancer) and Lieutenant Colonel Faruque  Rahman. PW 14 recognised Major Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Lancer) and Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar  Rashid Khan. PWs 17 and 18 recognised Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) at the parade  ground on 14th night. PWs 21 and 22 recognised  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed. (Artillery)  and Major Bazlul Huda at the parade ground. PW 23  recognised Lieutenant Colenel Faruque Rahman at                  the parade ground. PW 24 recognised Lieutenant  Colonel Faruque Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Artillery) and Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid  Khan at the parade ground. PW 25 recognised  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery)  and Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman at the  night parade.

      "738. If the previous and -subsequent  conducts have any reference to the proceedings  or relevant to the proceedings, must be influ-  enced by the relevant fact. The conduct made  relevant is conduct which is directly and imme-  diately influenced by a relevant fact, and it does  not include actions resulting from some inter-  mediate cause, such as question or suggestions    by other persons. Evidence of contemporaneous  conduct is always admissible as a surrounding  circumstance, to Judge what the real state of  accused’s mind on a previous occasion was, the  surrounding circumstances and subsequen;  events can be referred to. When once the prose.  cution has established the guilt of the accuse  by the evidence of the prosecution witnesses  then such subsequent conduct may be Utilise  as furnishing further proof of the correctness of  the conclusion as to the guilt of the accuseg  drawn from the evidence. This subsequent con.  duct may be exculpatory conduct of the accused  which is equally admissible because an admis.  sion may be proved by or on behalf of the per.  son making it if it is otherwise than an admis-  sion. In Anant Lagu vs State of Bombay AIR  1960 SC 500, it has been observed by  Hidayatullah, J, as follows:    “A criminal trial, of course, is not an  enquiry into the conduct of an accused for any  purpose other than to determine whether he is  guilty of the offence charged. In this connec-  tion, that piece of conduct can be held to be  incriminatory which has no reasonable explana-  tion except on the hypothesis that he is guilty,  Conduct which destroys the presumption of  innocence can alone be considered as material.”    ",
      "737. Section 8 of the Evidence Act embodies,  ina statutory form, the rule of evidence, that the tes-  timony of resgestae is always allowable when it  goes to the root of the matter. Preparation is a rele-  vant fact it being important in the consideration of  the question whether a person did a particular act or  not, to know whether he took any measures calcu-  lated to bring it about, premeditated action must  necessarily be proceeded not only by impelling  motives but by appropriate preparation. Preparation  and previous attempts to the offence are instances of  previous conduct of the party influencing the rele-  vant fact but other conduct also, whether of a party  or of an agent to a party, whether previous or subse-  quent, and whether influenced by a relevant fact, is  also admissible. Preparation consists in devising or  arranging means necessary for the commission of  the offence. The existence of a design or plan is usu-  ally employed evidentially to indicate the subse-  quent doing of the act planned or designed.    ",
      "736. The challenges before the criminal jus-  stem are to balance the rights of the accused  while dispensing speedy and effective justice. The  criminal justice system machinery must also meet  the challenge of effectively dealing with the emerg-  ing forms of crime and behaviour of criminals. It is  thus hoped that the obsolete laws prevailing in the  country will be amended and new suitable laws will  also be enacted to respond to the needs of changing  society in the light of the observations made above.  In view of the lack of proper law, I am unable to use  the digital evidence produced by the prosecution in  this case.    Previous and subsequent conducts.    ",
      "735. In chapter 6: The Validity-Reliability  standard for Scientific Evidence’ in David H Daye,  David E. Bernstein & Jennifer L. Mnookin, The New  Wigmore: A Treatise on Evidence—Expert Evidence  it is stated:    “The more dramatic impact of technology  is however, unfolding in the domain of proce-  dure. For instance, investigative agencies have  increasingly come to rely on forensic tech-  niques such as analysis of fingerprints, voice,  handwriting, blood samples, DNA and other  bodily substances for evidence gathering.  Software is also used for reconstructing the  images of suspects and aiding investigation. As  newer technologies are introduced to assist  investigation agencies, it is important to not be  blindly enthusiastic about their reliability. The  use of scientific techniques holds immense  promise in the criminal justice system, but                    before accepting each technic we must examine  it critically in light of the constitutional rights  granted to citizens and the requisite evidentiary  standard.”    ",
      "734. It is high time to evaluate how techno-  logical developments are transforming the function-  ing of the legal system. With the emergence of  newer technologies, uncertainties arise with regard  to the application of existing laws and occasionally  there is a need to create new laws to regulate their  use. The need for regulating new technologies is  usually prompted by social and cultural perceptions  about the advantage of a particular technology or  alternatively the scope of its misuse.    ",
      "733. In National Textile Workers’ Union vs PR  Ramakrishnan, AIR 1983 SC 75 Bhagwati, J speak-  ing for the majority observed as follows:    “We cannot allow the dead hand of the past  to stifle the growth of the living present. Law  cannot stand still; it must change with the chang-  ing social concepts and values. If the bark that  protects the tree fails to grow and expand along  with the tree, it will either choke the tree or if it  is a living tree, it will shed that bark and grow a  new living bark for itself. Similarly, if the law  fails to respond to the needs of changing society,  then either it will stifle the growth of the society  and choke its progress or if the society is vigor-  ous enough, it will cast away the law which  stands in the way of its growth. Law must there-  fore constantly be on the move adapting itself to  the fast-changing society and not lag behind.”    ",
      "732. Thus, under the amended provision, evi-  dence can be oral, documentary and electric record  in India. This means that in criminal matters evi-  dence can also be by way of electronic records such  as, video-cassette, compact disk and video confer-  encing. There is no corresponding law in our coun-  try. This Evidence Act is a procedural law and by the  same time is an on going statute. The principles of  interpreting an on going statute have been very  lucidly explained by Francis Benion in his commen-  taries on ‘Statutory Interpretation’ as under:  <br>  “It is presumed parliament intends the  Court to apply to an on going Act a construction  that continuously updates its wordings to allow  for changes since the Act was initially framed.  While it remains law, it has to be treated as  always speaking. This means that in its applica-  tion on any day, the language of the Act though  necessarily embedded in its own time, is never-  theless to be construed in accordance with the  need to treat it as a current law,    “That today’s construction involves the  Supposition that parliament was catering long  ago for a state of affairs that did not then exist  is no argument against that construction.  Parliament, in the wording of an enactment, is  xpected to anticipate temporal developments.  The drafter will foresee the future and allow for  it in the wording.”    ",
      "731. This section provides for dispensation  from personal attendance of the accused and in such  cases the evidence can be recorded in presence of  the Advocate. The presence of the Advocate is  deemed to be the presence of the accused. This  shows that actual physical presence is not a manda-  tory requirement. This indicates that the expression  ‘presence’ used in the section is not used in the sense  of actual physical presence of the accused. This s  tion is analogous to the confrontation clause set out  in the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.  After this amendment the Courts in USA are not  admitting recording evidence by video-conferencing  on the reasoning that video conferencing does not  satisfy the requirements of the confrontation clause.  Video-conferencing is a new scientific device adopt-  ed by the developed countries in which the accused  will be able to cross-examine the witness by putting  suitable questions. In State of Maharashtra vs Dr  Praful B Desai, (2003) 4 SCC 601, the Supreme  Court of India ruled that the evidence taken from a  witness through video-conferencing is compatible  with the requirements of the Code. As regards  admissibility of a statement recorded in a compact  disk or video-cassette or in a television channel, if  the accused does not deny his statement or admis-  sion, there is no difficulty in admitting such digital  or electronic evidence as documentary evidence. If  the accused denies the statement or admission, the  question of its admissibility has to be looked into  under the prevailing rules of evidence. The expres  sion ‘evidence’ has been defined in section 3 of the  Evidence Act, which reads as follows:                    vidence’ means and includes—  <br>  (1) all statements which the Court permits or  requires to be made before it by a witness, in  relation to matters of fact under enquiry; such  statements are called oral evidence;  <br>  (2) all documents produced for the inspection  of the Court, such documents are called docu-  mentary evidence.”    The documentary evidence defined in this  section does not cover ‘electronic record’, In  India, sub-section (2) of section 3 has been  amended in the following manner,  <br>  (3) all documents including electronic record  produced for the inspection of the Court; such  documents are called documentary evidence.”    ",
      "730. Now the question is, if those Procedure,  are followed, whether any digital evidence can, he  admissible in a criminal trial and used Againgy  accused under the existing law, The procedure for  trial of a criminal case has been expressly laid doy,  in the Code. The Procedure laid down therein is the  ‘presence of the accused’ while recording the ey.  dence. Section 353 provides the mode of recording  evidence, which reads: aa  <br>  “353. Evidence to be taken in presence of  accused—Except as otherwise provided, aly  evidence taken under chapters XX, XXII and  XXIII shall be taken in the presence of the  accused, or, when his personal attendance js  dispensed with, in presence of his Advocate”.    ",
      "729. The scientific working group on digital  evidence was established in February 1998 through  a collaborative effort of the Federal Crime Labora-  tory Directors in USA. The scientific working group  on digital evidence as the US-based component of  standardisation efforts conducted by the Inter- national Organisation on Computer Evidence was charged with the development of cross-disciplinary guidelines and standards for the recovery, preserving, and examination of digital evidence including electronic devices. In order to ensure that digital evidence is collected, preserved, examined, or transferred in a manner safeguarding the accuracy and reliability of the evidence, law enforcement and forensic organisations must establish and maintain an effective quality system standard operative procedure are documented quality control guidelines that must be supported by proper case records and use broadly accepted procedures, equipment and materials.    ",
      "728. Now in respect of admission of Digital or  Electronic Evidence, the party seeking to admit any  statement or admission of any person recorded in a  compact disk (CD) or video-cassette or any interview  conducted by any television channel relating to a rel-  evant fact or fact in issue must produce the original  compact disk or video-cassette or the programme  published in the television channel. The producer of  the programme must certify their authenticity in the  contents stating the date and place of recording of the  programme. The certificate must be signed by the  producer of the programme and his signature has to  be proved. This procedure has not been followed in  this case. The prosecution failed to produce the orig-  inal copy of the video-cassette and the producer did  not certify the authenticity of the cassette.    ",
      "727. The Court may take judicial notice under  section 57 of the Evidence Act certain matters which  are so notorious or clearly established that evident  of their existence is deemed unnecessary. The fac  enumerated in section 57 of the Evidence Act, if  their existence comes into question, the party who  assert their existence in the first instance, produce  any evidence in support of their assertions. They  need only ask the Court to say whether these facts  exist or not, if the Court’s own knowledge will not  help it, then it must look the matter up: the Court can  if it thinks proper, call upon the parties to assist it. In  my view, the alleged statement made by Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman to a reporter in the  issue of ‘The Sunday Times’ admitting his participa-  tion in the incident on 15th August 1975 will not be  admissible under section 57(13) of the Evidence  Act. Section 81 creates a presumption of g  ness in respect of the documents, such as, (a) an offi-  cial Gazette (b) the London Gazette (c) the Gazette  of Bangladesh (d) the Gazette of any state Govern-  ment, (e) a newspaper or journal, etc. Thou  presumption of genuineness attaches under this secion                     to a document purporting to be a newspaper or  journal, it cannot be treated as proof of the facts  reported therein, We cannot take judicial notice of  the facts stated in the news item being in the nature  of hearsay secondary evidence, unless proved by  evidence aliunde, A report in a newspaper or maga-  zine is only hearsay evidence. It is not one of the  documents referred to in section 78(2) of the  Evidence Act by which an allegation of fact can be  proved. The presumption of genuineness attached  under section 81 to a magazine report cannot be  treated as proof of the facts reported therein,    ",
      "726. Learned Attorney-General contended  that the issue of ‘Sunday Times’ is a ‘document’  within the meaning of the Evidence Act in which  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman in an  interview admitted his participation in the killing of  Bangabandhu, and secondly, the incident of 15th  August as a part of our history, the Court may take  judicial notice of any book or document relating to  the incident under section 57(13) of the Evidence  Act on such fact, which is a relevant fact. Learned  Attorney-General contended that as the accused did  not deny his interview with the reporter on his  examination under section 342 of the Code, this  video-cassette may be admitted as evidence under  section 3 of the Evidence Act. Learned Attorney-  General further contended that in the videocassette  Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman declared him-  self as the killer of Bangabandhu, which could be  taken as corroborative evidence. In support of his.  contention, the learned Attorney-General has cited  the cases of S Partap Singh vs State of Punjab AIR  1964 SC 72 and Islamic Republic of Pakistan vs  Abdul Wali Khan 1976 PLD SC 57.    ",
      "725. The prosecution has also tried to prove  the charges against the appellants on the basis of  electronic evidence and an alleged statement of  Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman to a reporter  on an issue of “The Sunday Times” published on  30th May 1976. Md Azizul Hug (PW 58) exhibited  the issue of “The Sunday Times” as Exhibit ‘X’.  This witness stated that as per request of the Crimi-  nal Investigation Department while he was posted as  Director, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, collected a  copy of the magazine through Mr Shafi-ul-Ahmed,  Counselor, Bangladesh High Commission, London  in which issue, the appellant Syed Faruque Rahman  admitted his complicity in the incident of 15th  August, 1975 to the effect that “I helped to kill  Mujib, dare you put me on trial”, This witness  proved the signature in the forwarding letter sent  with the magazine by Mr Shafi-UAhmed. The trial  Court marked the magazine with a note of objection  by the defence. This witness also exhibited with  objection a video-cassette broadcast by Granada  Independent Television in the United Kingdom in  the “World in Action” series on 2nd August, 1976 as  material Exhibit 32 along with a notorised certifi-  cate issued by Keith Robert Hopkins, Notary Public  certifying that “events leading to the assassination  of the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Bangladesh in  1975 and the military coup d'etat following that  assassination and that to the best of my knowledge,  information and belief the said video cassette is an  authentic copy of a television programme........” Md  Bakhtiar Hossain (PW 59) a local video recorder  lestified that he displayed a video cassette in which  Lieutenant Colenel Rashid and Lieutenant Colonel  Faruque Rahman admitted to Anthony Mascarenhas  in an interview that they killed Bangabandhu along  with his family, Sheikh Moni and Serniabat. He  Proved the cassette as Ext. 12. He stated that some-  one gave him the video cassette. He did not explain    how he received the same and whether or not it was  the original one.    ",
      "724. What Mr Mamun argued pinpointing the  alleged discrepancy on certain portions of the evi-  dence of the witnesses regarding the presence of  Major Bazlul Huda at the place of occurrence and                  his identification by the witnesses, are minor in  nature, which cannot be taken as contradictory state-  ments. The learned Counsel failed to point out any  contradictory statements of the witnesses, rather he  avoided the Court’s query as to whether the incrim-  jnating statements made by the witnesses about  Major Bazlul Huda’s overt act had been challenged  in course of cross-examination.  Digital Evidence  ",
      "723. In the case of Moyezuddin [31DLR (AD)  37] it has been observed as follows:    “We like to observe that the contradiction  in the statement of a witness, either with his  own statement or with the statement of another  witness, is a task of appreciation of the evi-  dence, and therefore, it is within the jurisdiction  of the trial Court and the Court of appeal on  fact, to deal with the question. No doubt there is  certain rule of prudence governing the case of  contradicting statements. It is first to be seen  whether the alleged statement is a discrepant  statement or contradictory statement. The dis-  crepant statement is one which is either irrele-  vant or incoherent, but it is not irreconcilable. A  discrepant statement is not fatal to the credibil-  ity of a witness. A contradictory statement is  one which is conflicting and is not reconcilable  with other statements either of his own or any  other witness. The question in such case is, that  it is open to a Court of fact either to reject the  whole evidence of a witness as untrustworthy or  to reject the contradictory part as unreliable or  to rely upon that portion, which in the opinion  of the Court, fits in with other evidence and the  facts and circumstances of the case.”    ",
      "722. In the case of Safdar Ali vs Crown [5  DLR (FC) 107 (64)], it has been observed that in a    criminal case, it is the duty of the Court to reviey,  the entire evidence that has been produced by the  prosecution and the defence. If, after examination of  the whole evidence, the Court is of the opinion tha,  there is a reasonable possibility that the defence py,  forward by the accused must be true, it is clear that  such a view reacts on the whole prosecution, ty  these circumstances, it has been observed, the  accused will be entitled to get benefit of doubt, not as  a matter of grace, but as of right, because the pro.  secution has not proved its case beyond reasonable  doubt. I do not dispute the statement of law argued by  the Federal Court. These are established principle of  law for the administration of criminal justice. In this  particular case, I find that the defence version put for-  warded by the accused does not affect the prosecution  case, rather it supports the prosecution case.    ",
      "721. As observed above, the defence did not  challenge the incriminating part of the material evi-  dence of the witnesses and therefore, their evidence  remain uncontroverted. The defence failed to estab-  lish facts favourable to them by cross-examining the  witnesses. Therefore, this decision instead of help-  ing the defence helps the prosecution case.    ",
      "720. In the case of Muslimuddin (38 DLR  (AD) 311], the appellants were convicted for the                  charge of murder relying upon the evidence of the  deceased's wife Majeda (PW 1) who is said to have  been corroborated by PW 3 another e: itness but  the Appellate Division noticed that PW 3 was exam-  ined by the police long after the occurrence, and on  that score disbelieved her evidence. The Appellate  Division also noticed that PW 1 was present in the  hut at the time of occurrence but she was not cor-  roborated by other witnesses, and that it was totally  improbable on her part to recognise so many  accused persons with precision of their overt act and  disbelieved her as well. I failed to understand why  the leamed Counsel has referred this decision. In  that case it has been observed:    “In a criminal trial determination of a dis-  puted fact is the main task before the Court and  such determination is dependent upon consider-  ation of answers given by prosecution witness-  es in their cross-examination. Cross examina-  tion is therefore, indispensably necessary to  bring out desirable facts of a case modifying the  examination in chief or establishing the cross-  examiner’s own case, The object of cross-exa-  mination is two-fold, to bring out the case of the  party cross-examining and to impeach the  creadibility of the witness. In examination in  chief the witness discloses only those facts  which are favourable to the party examining  him and does not disclose the necessary facts  which go in favour of the other side. Cross  examination in a criminal case aims at extrac-  tion of the facts which support the defence ver-  sion which is very often sought to be supposed  by the prosecution. The opponents can of  course establish facts favourable to them by  calling their own witnesses; but “there is some    thing dramatic in proving one’s own case from .    the mouth of the witnesses of the opponent.”    ",
      "719. In the case of Hazrat Ali (54 DLR 636),  it has been observed that when the evidence of wit-  nesses is disbelieved by the Court in respect of a  major part of the prosecution case regarding the  involvement of the accused persons, the testimony  of those witnesses cannot be accepted without inde-  pendent corroboration from other sources. We do  not dispute the observations made by the High Court  Division in that case. In this particular case, the  learned Counsel has failed to point out any major  contradiction in the evidence of the witnesses so as  to disbelieve them in respect of the majority part of  the prosecution case.    ",
      "717. The first learned Judge also believed  PWs 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 25, while find-  ing Major Bazlul Huda, Major AKM Mohiuddin  Ahmed, Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman  and Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahrior Rashid  Khan’s guilty of the charges but disbelieved PWs16,  17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 32, and 35 while dis-  believing about Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin  Ahmed’s (Artillery) complicity in the occurrence.  While disbelieving them, the learned Judge made  inconsistent findings, inasmuch as, the learned  Judge believed some of them while finding the other  four appellants guilty of the charges. The finding of  the learned Judge that “the presence of the convict  with CO at parade was part of duty and that parade  in the night of 14th August was held as per pre-exist-  ing practice as seen from the evidence of PWs 44  and 45” are based on misconception of fact and also  on piecemeal consideration of the evidence of PWs  44 and 45, The learned Judge failed to comprehend  the admitted fact that as a part of conspiracy the  night parade on 14th August was arranged by Lieu-  tenant Colonel Rashid and in course of such night    parade, the accused persons finalised their plan to”    fulfil their criminal object and with that end in view,  they took ammunition from the kote, removed heavy  artillery from the cantonment, deployed the troops  with artillery at key points and thereafter some of  the officers with troops went to the house of the  President to materialise their object and killed the    President and other members of his family over  which I have discussed earlier. If this appellant's  participation at the night parade was a part of pre-  existing practice, then when, where and how the  accused persons hatched up the conspiracy to kill  the President has not been explained by the first  learned Judge. The learned Judge also did not clari-  fy as to why the accused officers directed the troops  to take arms and ammunition and why they amalga-  mated two units after the parade and why the night  parade continued till the early hours of 15th August,  and lastly, why the officers and the troops came to  the President's house from the parade ground, which  sufficiently proved that the nigh parade was the  sheet-anchor of the premeditated criminal conspira-  cy for fulfilling their criminal object.    718, In the case of Nurul Islam 43 DLR (AD)  6, the leave was granted to consider the glaring  inconsistency and discrepancy in the evidence of 4  eye-witnesses, PWs 1, 3, 7 and 8 that cast a doubt as  to the truth of the prosecution case. The Appellate  Division on assessing their evidence found it diffi-  cult to rely upon them and observed that the leamed  Judges of the High Court Division did not consider  the material discrepancy of these eye-witnesses  while maintaining the conviction and sentence, and  set aside the conviction disbelieving the prosecution  case. This decision referred by the learned Counsel  is not applicable in this case in view of the fact that  the prosecution has led unimpeachable evidence  against the accused and that the defence has failed to  point out any inconsistency to discard the evidence  of prosecution witnesses.    ",
      "716. It will not be out of place to mention here  that all the above prosecution witnesses are army                  personnel of Lancer and Artillery units with which  the appellants and other co-accused were attached as  officers. The defence failed to point out any enmity  with them or their motive to depose against them in  support of the prosecution case. They appear to be  unbiased, not even remotely inimical to the accused,  The defence also failed to make out which may tend  to indicate that they have a motive for attributing  untruthful statements to the accused. They virtually  admitted their participation in the incident of murder  by not challenging the testimonies of those witness-  es relating to the incriminating part of their com-  plicity. All of them are neutral and trustworthy wit-  nesses. There is no cogent ground to discard their  testimonies. The second and the Third learned  Judges of the High Court Division and the learned  Sessions Judge have believed them as independent  and reliable witnesses.    ",
      "715. As regards the appellant Lieutenan  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) PWs 17, 18,  21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32, 34 and 35 proved as  regards his presence at the night parade wherefrom  the troops of his unit came to Kalabagan Lake Cir-  cus play ground, and set up cannons aiming Banga.  bandhu’s house and the Rakshibahini head-quarter.  The witnesses proved that as per his order, his troops  fired 4 rounds of cannon-ball from Kalabagan play  ground aiming Bangabandhu’s house and Rakshi-  bahini headquarter. He did not deny the statement of  these witnesses. In view of these evidence on record  it cannot be said that there is no sufficient materials  on record to implicate him in the occurrence of ISth  August, 1975. He has also admitted his complicity  in the confessional statement. He was also implicat-  ed by other two confessing accused and those con-  fessions have been corroborated by the oral evi-  dence on record. The first learned Judge on a super-  ficial consideration of these witnesses and other evi-  dence disbelieved his complicity in the occurrence.  The learned Judge committed a fundamental error in  holding that his presence at the night parade was a  normal routine work and no exception could be  inferred from this act of participation. The learned  Judge also did not take any exception even after he  was recognised at Kalabagan play ground with can-  nons and his participation for the attainment of the  object by directing his troops to fire cannon-balls  aiming Bangabandhu’s house and Rakshibahini  headquarter at the time of occurrence. In the prem-  ises, there is no doubt that he was involved in the  occurrence and helped the other co-accused to com-  mit the carnage. The second and the Third learned  Judges are perfectly justified in finding his complic-  ity in the occurrence.    ",
      "714. As regards Lieutenant Colonel Sultan  Shahriar Rashid Khan PWs14 and 24 proved his  presence at the night parade on 14th August at Balur-  ghat and I have observed earlier'about his  complici-  ty in the occurrence while discussing the evidence  of PW 14, PWs 20, 37, 42, 46 and 47 proved his  subsequent conducts which could be used as corrob-  orating evidence for furnishing further proof of the    correctn of the conclusion of the guilt drawn  from the evidence. He made confessional statements  about his complicity in the occurrence and he alse  made extra judicial confession admitting his  involvement in the killing of the President. The  other two confessing accused also implicated him,  From the above evidence it cannot be said that his  conviction is based without reliable and corroboray.  ing evidence on record.    ",
      "713. As regards Lieutenant Colonel AKM  Mohiuddin (Lancer), it is seen that PWs 4 and 5 saw  him while he was entering into the house of  Bangabandhu by firing. PW 4 further stated that he  saw while this appellant was taking Bangabandhu  down at the stair and thereafter Major Bazlul Huda  and Major Noor shot him to death. Besides these  two witnesses, PW 11 saw him at the gate of Banga-  bandhu’s house at or about the time of occurrence  and PW 12 saw him while he was getting down from  the truck at the entry point of Road No.32 just  before the occurrence. Besides these witnesses, PWs  21 and 22 saw him while they were dropped at the  meeting point of Road No.32. He was implicated by  the three confessing accused and those confessions  were corroborated by the oral evidence on record.  PW I5 also proved his extra-judicial confession.  Therefore, | find that the learned Judges of the High  Court Division have rightly found his complicity in  the incident of 15th August, 1975,    ",
      "712. As regards Lieutenant Col Syed Faruque  Rahman, PWs 11 and 12 recognised him at the night  parade wherefrom he along with his force marched  towards Dhanmondi and thereafter he was seen by  PWs 1, 4, 11 at the gate of Bangabandhu's house at  or about the time of occurrence with a tank and  talked with Major Huda, Major Mohiuddin  (Lancer), Major Noor and others, and when he was  confirmed about the death of Bangabandhu and  other members of his family, he left the place of  occurrence, PW 12 also saw him at about 7-15 AM  at Mirpur road while he was coming out from the  road No.32 with a tank. Besides these oral state-  ments, PW 15 proved the extra judicial confession  of this appellant and PW 51 proved his confession.  The evidence of these witnesses and the confession  sufficiently proved that he was also involved in the  occurrence and the learned Judges of the High Court  Division are perfectly justified in finding his com-  plicity in the murder.    ",
      "711. Onan analysis of the evidence on record  it is seen that there are uncontroverted evidence on  record against the appellant Major Bazlul Huda’s  shooting to death of Sheikh Kamal and Bangaban-  dhu on 15th August. PWs 1, 4 and 6 are the eye-wit-  ness of the occurrence and they have stated that  Major Bazlul Huda shot to death Sheik Kamal. PW.  4 further stated that Major Bazlul Huda along with  Major Noor shot to death Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman. PWs 5 and 7 also recognised him  at the time of occurrence at Bangabandhu’s house  besides these three witnesses. This appellant was  also seen by PWs 11, 21 and 22, at the night parade,  wherefrom he along with others came to Banga-  bandhu’s house and killed Sheikh Kamal and  Bangabandhu. Therefore, I find that there are uncon-  troverted evidence against this appellant of shooting  to death of Sheikh Kamal and Bangabandhu on 15th  August, 1975, PWs 8 and 15 also proved his extra  judicial confessions regarding his complicity in the  occurrence of killing. The leaned Judges of the  High Court are therefore, perfectly justitied in find-  ing him guilty of the charge of murder.                  ",

      "702. In respect of Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-  uddin Ahmed (Artillery), the prosecution has exam-  ined PWs 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32, 34 and  35 in support of the charge leveled against him. PW  17 was a Nayek of Two Field Artillery regiment at  the relevant time in which the appellant was a com-  mander of Papa Battery. He deposed regarding the  presence of the appellant at the night parade at  Balurghat on 14th August 1975. This witness has  narrated about the parade in detail. This witness stat-  ed that after the parade Major Mohiuddin stood  behind the Papa Battery cannon and gave some  directions by calling Subedor Hashem. Thereupon  Hashem called the Jawans and reminded them about  the direction and then he directed them to board on  the truck and called 4/5 gunners including this wit-  ness from the Quebec Battery and thereafter Has-  hem hooked 6 cannons to trucks after examining  them and thereafter the trucks loaded with cannons  started moving around 3-30/4-00 AM He was with  Major Mohiuddin in the same vehicle. The trucks  reached Kalabagan area at 4-00 AM and as per  direction of Major Mohiuddin, the cannons were set  up aiming Bangabandhu’s house at Road No.32 and  Rakshibahini headquarter. He further stated that as  per order of Major Mohiuddin, they fired 4 rounds  of cannon-balls and some time thereafter, when the  morning light was visible as per order of Major  Mohiuddin they closed the cannons and hooked  with the truck and then they returned to their bar-  rack. This appellant did not challenge the statement  of this witness (ating to the incriminating portion  in course of cross-examination.    ",
      "701. PW 12 made statements in corroboration  with PW 11 and stated that he saw Major Faruque  Rahman and other accused persons at the parade on  14th August night. He further stated that Major  Faruque Rahman inspected the parade and directed  to follow RDM night class. Thereafter this witness  narrated about marching of the troops towards the  Road No.32 from the parade ground. He also narrat-  ed the manner of hearing sounds of firing after  reaching to the place of occurrence, He further stat-  ed he saw the appellant with a tank at about 7-14  AM while he came to Mirpur road from road No.32.  As regards the appellant Lieutenant Colonel Sultan  Shahriar Rashid Khan, the prosecution has exam-  ined PW 14 who proved his presence at the night  parade at Balurghat. PW 14 stated that he was pres-    ent at the night parade on 14th August at Balurghat  which ended at 2-00/2-30 AM, that at that time they  were directed to fall-in, that after coming to the  parade ground he saw Major Faruque, Major Mohi-  uddin and other accused persons and two other per-  sons in civil dress. Along with them, he also saw  Major Rashid with some officers of Artillery unit.  Major Faruque directed them to mark fall-in and  reminded them that they were made to fall-in for  executing an important task, that thereafter he intro-  duced two persons in civil dress as Major Dalim and  the other as Major Shahriar, this appellant, that he  told that they would work with them and that the  troops were required to obey their directions. There-  after, he narrated about the movement of the tanks  and the other incidents. The defence did not chal-  lenge the statement of this witness that this appellant  came at the night parade at Balurghat at 2- 2-30 in  civil dress or that Major Faruque introduced the  Jawans while on fall-in condition about the identity  of the appellant. The evidence of this witness so far  as it relates to the incriminating portion about his  participation in the night parade and his identifica-  tion remain uncontroverted. Admittedly this appel-  lant was a dismissed/released officer from the army  and he was not supposed to remain present at the  army’s night parade at mid night on 14th August  1975. The learned Counsel contended that there is  no corroborating evidence of PW 14 that he was pre-  sent at Balurghat. Not only that he did not deny the  statements of PW 14 about his presence at Balur-  ghat, he also did not give any explanation in his  written explanation in reply to his examination  under section 342 of the Code despite the fact that  he was confronted with the statement of PW 14. PW.  24 also corroborated PW 14 about this appellant’s  identification at the night parade on 14th August.  Besides the statements of PWs14 and 24, he also  admitted about his presence in the night parade in  his confessional statement over which I discussed  earlier. He also admitted in his extra judicial confes-  sion about his complicity in the murder. His subse-  quent conduct proved by PWs 20, 37, 42, 46, 47  over which I would discuss later on, which can be  used as corroborating evidence, sufficiently proved  his involvement in the occurrence. There is no rule  of law that the uncorroborated testimony of one wit-                  ness cannot be accepted, As a general rule, a Court  may act on the testimony of a single witness, though  uncorroborated, Unless corroboration is insisted  upon by statute the Court should not insist on cor-  roboration, except in eases where the nature of the  testimony of the single witness itself requires that  corroboration should be insisted upon, and that the  question, whether corroboration of the testimony of a  single witness was or was not necessary, must depend  upon the facts and circumstances of each case.    ",
      "700. PW 11 deposed that in the night parade  on 14th August 1975 he saw Two IC Major Faruque  and at that time Resalder Moslehuddin saluted him.  This witness then narrated about the marching of the  troops towards the house of Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman. He then narrated the incident  vividly. He further stated that Major Faruque came  with a tank at the gate of Bangabandhu’s house  when Major Mohiuddin, Major Noor, Captain Huda,  Resalder Sarwar and other army personnel of  Artillery unit came nearer to him, that they talked  with him for some time and thereafter Major  Faruque left with the tank. He identified Major  Faruque in the dock. He did not challenge the state-  ments made by this witness about his identification  in the parade ground and at the gate of Banga-  bandhu’s house with tank at or about the time of  occurrence.    ",
      "698. In respect of Lieutenant Colonel Faruque  Rahman, the prosecution examined PWs 1, 4, 11  and 12 to prove the charge against him. PW | stated  that at the time of occurrence he saw Major Faruque  Rahman at the gate of Bangabandhu’s house and on  his query, Major Bazlul Huda told him that “all are  finished.” The recognition of the appellant by this  witness has not been challenged in course of cross-  examination.    699, PW 4 stated that at or about the time of  occurrence, Major Faruque came in front of Banga-  bandhu’s main gate with a tank and at that time  Major Noor, Major Aziz Pasha, Major Mohiuddin,  Captain Bazlul Huda and others came there and                  talked with him for some time. He identified Major  Faruque in the dock. He further stated that some  time thereafter Major Faruque called Captain Bazlul  Huda and Subedar Major Abdul Wahab and decorat-  ed Captain Bazlul Huda with a badge of Major and  Subedar, Abdul Wahab Joarder with a badge of  Lieutenant and then he addressed them as Major  Huda and Lieutenant Joarder respectively. The pres-  ence of this appellant at the gate of Bangabandhu  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's house at or about the  time of occurrence as deposed by the witness has  not been denied by him.    ",
      "697. Therefore, his evidence remain uncon-  troverted.    ",
      "696. PW 22 made statements in corroboration  with the statements of PW 21, whose evidence hag  been discussed while considering the complicity of  Major Bazlul Huda. He further stated that he along  with PW 21 and other army personnel were dropped  at Road No.32 by the side of a canal, that the com.  mander directed them to see that no outsider entered  into Road No.32, that thereafter he heard sounds of  firing and that he along with Naik Nazrul, Sepoy  Khalek and others proceeded towards east and there  he found army personnel of Artillery unit and Lan-  cer unit were standing in front of a house and on  query he came to know that the house belonged to  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Thereafter  he along with the guards, commander Nazrul, Kha-  lek and others entered into the house of Banga-  bandhu and saw the dead bodies and on coming out  of the house after talking with the army personnel  standing at the gate , he learnt that Major Mohiuddin  (Lancer) and other officers killed Bangabandhu and  his family members. This appellant did not chal-  lenge incriminating part of the evidence of this wit-  ness in course of cross-examination.    ",
      "695. PW 12 also identified this appellant at  the parade ground on 14th August. He stated that  this appellant directed the army personnel who were  at the parade to board into the vehicle, that at about  4-30 AM they came to the meeting point of Dhan-  mondi Road No.32 by six trucks via Balurghat  Cantonment-Rail crossing-Mohakhali Road and  Farmgate, that he was with the appellant in the same  truck, that this appellant directed all of them to get  down from the truck at the meeting point of Road  No.32 and then he briefed them that they should not  be frightened on hearing the sounds of firing as  theirs’ and those of Major Dalim’s persons were  inside and thereafter, this appellant along with some  force entered into Road No.32. In course of cross-  examination, this appellant did not challenge the  incriminating part of his complicity and that he  entered into Road No,32 with his force just immedi-  ate before the occurrence. | have narrated his evi-  dence while considering the complicity of appellant    Bazlul Huda and therefore, in order to avoid Tepeti-  tion, | have refrained from reiterating his evidence,  In cross-examination, this witness has reconfirmed  his statement in chief about this appellant’s presence  at the parade ground and his entering through the  Road No.32 with his force just immediate prior to  the occurrence.    ",
      "694. PW 11 had identified this appellant at the  parade. He saw two persons in civilian dress who  came out of this appellant’s office at about 12 at night  on 14th August and at that time, the appellant called  Huda to come towards him. He also stated that this  appellant arranged army dress for those two persons  who were in civil dress. While discussing the evi-  dence of this witness about the complicity of Huda, I  discussed the complicity of this appellant as well.    ",
      "693. PW 5 corroborated the statement of PW  4 that this appellant along with his force entered into  the house by firing. The appellant has not chal-  lenged the testimony of this witness in that regard,  Therefore, the identification of the appellant at the  place of occurrence and his direct participation in  the carnage deposed by this witness remain uncon-  troverted.    ",
      "692. In respect of the appellant Major AKM  Mohiuddin (Lancer), the prosecution has examined  PWs 4, 5, 7, 11,12, 21, 22 to prove the charge lev-  eled against him. PW 4 stated that he recognised this  appellant along with appellant Bazlul Huda at the  gate of Bangabandhu’s house. He also stated that  this appellant along with the force of his unit pro-  ceeded towards the first floor of Bangabandhu’s  house by firing and thereafter they brought Ban;  bandhu down and when they were on the stair  Captain Bazlul Huda and Major Noor shot him to                    death. He further stated that after killing of  Bangabandhu this appellant and others got down  and left towards south, In course of cross-examina-  tion, this appellant did not challenge the statements  of PW 4 regarding the incriminating part of his  involvement in the incident and therefore, the evi-  dence that the appellant along with his force entered  into the house of Bangabandhu by firing and  brought Bangabandhu down on the point of arms for  facilitating the killing remain uncontroverted.    ",
      "691. On an analysis of the evidence, I find  that the prosecution has been able to prove by unim-  peachable evidence about the presence of the appel-  lant at the night parade on the 14th August and from  there the appellant along with co-accused came to  the place of occurrence, that he shot to death Sheikh  Kamal and Bangabandhu and that he was seen while  he was approaching towards the first floor of Banga-  bandhu’s house where upon the other inmates of the  Bangabandhu’s house were brutally killed.    ",
      "690. PW 22 was a sepoy of Two Field Artil-  lery during the relevant time. He stated that he was  present at the night parade on 14th night till 12 at  night. At about 2-30 AM the commanding officer  Khondker Abdur Rashid along with the appellant  Bazlul Huda and some other officers came there.  Major Rashid told them to get ready for special duty  and if necessary they were required to open fire. He  corroborated the testimony of PW 21 about their  coming to road No.32 from the nigh parade with  arms and his recognition of the appellant. The appel-  lant declined to cross examine him.    ",
      "689. PW 21 was deployed in the Two Field  Artillery of Papa Battery during the relevant time.  He stated that he attended the night parade and  thereafter he along with other soldiers was kept  towards the southern side of Airport runway, At    about 2-00 AM their commending officer Major  Khondker Abdur Rashid along with Major Mohi-  uddin, (Lancer), Captain Bazlul Huda and other  officers came there. Major Khondker Abdur Rashid  told them to make themselves prepared with arms  and ammunition as they would be taken to an emer-  gency duty.

He  stated that after Azan he heard sounds of firing  towards the eastern side and thereafter he came to  know that the appellant and other accused persons  killed Bangabandhu and the members of his family.    ",
      "688. During the relevant time PW 12 was ser-  ving in the First Bengal Lancer unit in which Major  Faraque Rahman was their commanding officer. He  also stated that in the parade ground he saw the  appellant Bazlul Huda and other accused persons  including Syed Faruque Rahman and Major Mohi-  uddin Ahmed (Lancer), He further stated that in the  second phase of parade which started after 3-30 AM,  he found the appellant Bazlul Huda along with other  officers including Syed Faruque Rahman, Major  Mohiuddin (Lancer), Major Faruque Rahman intro-  duced Major Dalim, Captain Bazlul Huda and  another to them. Thereafter Major Faruque directed  them to bring ammunition from the kote. As per  direction, they brought ammunition and came to the  parade ground. Major Mohiuddin (Lancer) directed  them to board into the vehicle. The army personnel  boarded on 3 trucks and the others boarded on  another truck. At about 4-30 AM they approached  via Balurghat Cantonment-Rail crossing Farm Gate  and from Farm Gate they approached towards  Dhanmondi Road No.32 through the Mirpur Road  and at the meeting point of Road No.32, Mohiuddin  (Lancer) directed them to get down from the truck  and thereafter he briefed them not to be frightened  on hearing sounds of firing as they were theirs’ and  Major Dalim’s people and that he directed them not  to allow anybody to enter into Road No.32. There-  afier he narrated the other incidents that happened  after killing of the President and the members of his  family. The appellant did not challenge the incrimi-  nating part of the evidence in chief of this witness as  regards his recognition of Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin  (Lancer), Dalim and Faruque at the parade ground  and the marching of the troops towards the house of  the then President.    ",
      "687. PW 11 attended the night parade on 14th  August which was arranged in front of his store. He  identified Captain Huda, Major AKM Mohiuddin  (Lancer) and Major Faruque Rahman there. He stat-    ed that at about 4-00 AM the troops on a vehicle  approached towards the house of Bangabandhu  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and they were asked to get  down from the vehicle about 80 yards west of Ban-  gabandhu’s residence at about 4-30 AM, when  Resalder Sarwar told him to follow the order of  Major Mohiuddin. Major Mohiuddin directed them  not to allow movement of people in front of the  house of Bangabandhu and to disarm the police on  duty. He heard sounds of firing inside the house of  Bangabandhu and then heard the order saying  ‘hands up’, that Resalder Sarwar directed him not to  allow anybody to enter into Bangabandhu’s house  and at that time Major Mohiuddin , Major Noor,  Captain Bazlul Huda and others entered into  Bangabandhu’s house, that he heard sounds of firing  from the house of Bangabandhu and screaming of  women, that Major Mohiuddin, Major Noor, Cap-  tain Bazlul Huda came out and at that time Noor  directed Subedar Major to go inside and to ascertain  whether all were finished, that Captain Huda direct-  ed him through Sarwar to disperse the persons  standing beside the lake, that thereafter he heard the  sound of movement of tanks and one tank came in  front of Bangabandhu’s house, that Major Faruque  got down from the tank when Major Mohiuddin,  Major Noor, Captain Huda and others came nearer                  to him and talked with him for some time, and there-  after Major Faruque left with the tank, This state-  ment of this witness about the complicity of the  appellant Bazlul Huda in the incident has not been  challenged directly or indirectly, Therefore, this  statement remains uncontroverted.    ",
      "686. PW 6 was also a member of the security  team deputed at Bangabandhu’s house. He is anoth-  er eye-witness of the occurrence. He stated that on  15th August at about 4-30 AM Habilder Gani made  all the security staff to fall-in in front of guard room  and some time thereafter 2/3 trucks with force in  black dress stopped towards the western side of  Bangabandhu’s house , and there was firing towards    andhu’s house from the lake side. In corrop-  oration with the testimonies of PWs | and 4, he stay.  ed that when Kamal called the security team to fo}.  low him, Captain Bazlul Huda, another officer of  Lancer unit with black dress, and some jawans of  artillery unit entered into Bangabandhu’s house  Soon thereafter Captain Huda and another shot ay  Sheikh Kamal who rolled down inside the receptioy,  room on sustaining gun shot injury. Captain Huda  again shot at him. Thereafter Captain Huda ang  another officer proceeded towards the first floor,  Some time thereafter he heard sounds of firing and  screaming of women. Bazlul Huda did not challenge  the incriminating part of the statement of this wit-  ness and therefore, the statement that PW 6 saw  Bazlul Huda while he shot to death Sheikh Kamal  remain uncontroverted.    ",
      "685. PW 4 is another eye-witness and an army  jawan posted in the field artillery regiment during  the relevant time, and he was deputed as security  staff of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with some  other army personnel of his company. He stated that  Captain Bazlul Huda and 3 other army personnel  were also in the field artillery unit, that on 15th  August, 1975 at about 5-00 AM he along with other  security staff noticed that Subedar Major Abdul  Wahab Joarder was getting down from the jeep in  front of the house on Road No.31 where he along  with other security personnel were staying using it  as temporary barrack for guarding the President's  house. Thereafter he along with other guards came  to Bangabandhu’s house and after reaching there  they hoisted flag upon playing bugle. At that time he  noticed indiscriminate firing towards Bangaban-  dhu’s house from the southern side of the lake. At  that time black and khaki dressed army personnel  entered into the house by shouting ‘hands up’, of  them, he identified Captain Bazlul Huda, Major  Mohiuddin (Lancer) and another who were then at  the gate. Kamal was standing on the verandah, and  on seeing him Captain Bazlul Huda shot at him with  stengun in his hands. Sheikh Kamal fell down inside  the reception room. Captain Bazlul Huda again shot  at Kamal and killed him. Thereafter Major Mohi-  uddin (Lancer) with his force proceeded towards the  first floor by opening fire, Thereafter Bazlul Huda  and Noor with their force followed him, As per their  direction, they also followed them. He saw that                    Major Mohiuddin and his force were taking Ban-  gabandhu down to the ground floor. At that time  Bangabandhu queried them what they were intend-  ing to do and soon thereafter, Huda and Noor shot at  Bangabandhu with their stenguns, who died on the  spot. The statement of this witness that he saw  Bazlul Huda and Mohiuddin (Lancer) at the gate,  that Bazlul Huda, Major Noor and his force  approached towards the first floor and that Huda and  Noor shot at Bangabandhu on the stair had not been  denied by Captain Bazlul Huda in course of cross-  examination or by giving suggestion to him. The  incriminating part of the statement of this witness  remains uncontroverted. Appellant Major Mohi-  uddin also did not challenge the testimony of this  witness as regards his recognition at the gate of  Bangabandhu’s house and the statement of this wit-  ness that he saw Mohiuddin and his force bringing  Bangabandhu down to the ground floor. PW 5 was  also jawan of artillery unit and he was deputed at  Bangabandhu’s house as security guard.

The defence did not  challenge his statement that he recognised Captain  Bazlul Huda and Major Mohiuddin (Lancer) while  they were entering into Bangabandhu’s house by fir-  ing at the time of occurrence.    ",
      "684. PW 1 is the informant and claimed as an  eye-witness, He was the resident PA of Banga-  bandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman deputed at house  No. 677 of Road No, 32, Dhanmondi during the rel-  evant time where the President was staying. He stat-  ed that on the day of occurrence at about 4-30/5-00  AM, he woke up on the call of the telephone mecha-  nic Abdul Matin that the President wanted to talk  with him over telephone. Soon thereafter he took the  receiver when the President directed him to connect  the Police Control Room stating that the miscreants  attacked Serniabat’s house. He failed to connect the  police control room as well as the Ganabhaban. In  the meantime Bangabandhu came down into the  office room and wanted to talk himself by taking the  receiver from him. At that time showers of bullet hit  the wall of the room breaking the window glass  asunder. They have lain down beside the table.  There was a break of firing when Sheikh Kamal got  down and stood on the verandah. The security staff  accompanied him and at that time 3/4 army person-  nel in khaki and black dress with arms in their hands  stood in front of them, the appellant Major Bazlul  Huda shot on the leg of Sheikh Kamal, who rolled  down beside his leg when he told PW | to make the  assailant known that he was the son of Sheikh  Mujib. PW 1 told the assailant about the identity of  Sheikh Kamal and soon thereafter, he brush fired  aiming Sheikh Kamal. One bullet hit his leg and  another hit PW 50’s leg, Sheikh Kamal died on the  Spot. At one stage PW 50 wanted to take out PW 1  and Sheikh Kamal through the back side door and  when they came nearer to the door, Major Bazlul    Huda pulled him back by catching his hair. There  were other armed army personnel with him. Major  Bazlul Huda lined up PW 1 and others in front of the  main gate. Some time thereafter he heard shouting  noise of Bangabandhu and indiscriminate firing and  screaming of women, He also narrated how Sheikh  Naser was shot to death and the uttering of Bazlul  Huda on query made by Major Faruque that “all are  finished”, On hearing the uttering of Bazlul Huda,  he understood that the President and his family  members were brutally killed. This witness made  positive statement that Major Bazlul Huda shot  Sheikh Kamal to death on the spot. The defence did  not challenge his statement in course of cross-exam-  ination and therefore, his statement that the appel-  lant shot to death Sheikh Kamal remains uncontro-  verted.    ",
      "683. The appellants have not raised in these  appeals as to whether the trial of the appellants have  been vitiated by some illegality or that it has been  held in violation of the rules of natural justice or that  by reason of misreading of the evidence a grave mis-  carriage has resulted in maintaining the conviction                  py the High Court Division. Despite that we have  afforded the learned Counsels to argue the appeals  on the basis of the evidence on record taking into  consideration that the appellants have been sen-  tenced to death for ends of justice, In support of the  charges leveled against the appellant Major Bazlul  Huda, the prosecution has examined A.F.M.Mohitul  Islam (PW 1), Habilder (Retd) Md Quddus Sikder  (pw 4), Nk.Subedar (Retd) Abdul Gani (PW 5),  Habilder Ganner (Retd) Sohrab Ali (PW 6), ALD  Sirajul Hug (PW 12), Lieutenant Naik Abdul Khalek  (PW 21), Habilder Abdul Aziz (PW 22). The learned  Judges of the High Court Division have exhaustive-  ly discussed their evidence on record. I would refer  only the glimpses of their statements.    ",
      "682. Similar views have been expressed in the  cases of Metro vs State of UP AIR 1971 SC 1050.  Subeder vs State of UP AIR 1971 SC 125, and Ram  Sanjiwan Singh vs State of Bihar, AIR 1996 SC  3265.    ",
      "681. Before we deal with the contentions of  the learned Counsels, it will be necessary to keep in  view the limited scope in these appeals against the  judgments and orders of conviction and sentence as    rendered by the High Court Division as well as the  trial Court against the appellants. Artic! 103(3) of  the Constitution does not confer a right of appeal oy  any party from a judgment and order passed by the  High Court Division, it merely clothes this Court,  with discretionary power to scrutinise and go into,  evidence in special circumstances in order to satisfy,  itself that substantial and grave injustice has been  done to the accused. Though the expression “discre-  tionary” has not been used in this clause of the  Article as has been used in the corresponding Indian  provision, (Article 136) but in view of the powers  given to this Court to exercise the jurisdiction, if it  grants leave from the judgment, order or sentence  manifestly suggest that this power is discretionary  one. Article 103(3) is couched in the verbatim lan-  guage of Article 136 of the Constitution of India,  The Supreme Court of India in Hargun Sundar Das  vs State of Maharastha, AIR 1970 SC 1514, consid-  ered the scope of its jurisdiction to assess the evi-  dence in an appeal against conviction, and observed  as follows:<br>    “We may appropriately repeat what has  been pointed out by this Court under Article  136 of the Constitution, this Court does not nor-  mally proceed to review the evidence in crimi-  nal cases unless trial is vitiated by some illegal-  ity or material irregularity of procedure or the  trial is held in violation of rules of natural jus-  tice resulting in unfairness to the accused or the  judgment or order under appeal has resulted in  grave miscarriage of justice. This article  reserves to this Court a special discretionary  power to interfere in suitable cases when for  special reasons it considers that interference is  called for in the larger interest of justice.    ",
      "680. The common points canvassed by the  leamed Counsels are that the leamed Judges of the  High Court Division upon superficial consideration  of the evidence on record have confirmed the death  sentence of the appellants in failing to consider that  there is no legal evidence on record in support of the  charges. It was also contended that the appellants  attended the night parade as a part of their, routine  works and that their presence at the parade could not  be connected with the murder of Bangabandhu  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members.  According to the learned Counsels, the killing was  the consequence of a revolt of the army to overthrow.  the Government of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur  Rahman in which, the appellants were not involved.  In that view of the matter, it is argued that the con-  viction of the appellants is based on conjectures and  surmises, and the learned Judges of the High Court  Division erred in law in maintaining their conviction  and sentence,    ",
      "679. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, learned  Counsel appearing for Licutenant Colonel Shahriar  Rashid Khan argued that there is no reliable evi-  dence about Shahriar Rashid's complicity in the  murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  and other members of his family. Learned Counsel  submitted that the learned Judges of the High Court  Division erred in law in relying upon the testimony  of PW 14 about his presence at the night parade at  Balurghat in the absence of any other corroborating  evidence and thus, his conviction for the charge of  murder was illegal. Learned Counsel further con-  tends that if the evidence of PW 14 is disbelieved,  the only evidence against Shahriar Rashid is about  his presence at the Radio Station at about 6 AM on  15th August and this fact has no nexus with the mur-  der of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman since  he was reemployed with effect from 15th August,  1975, his presence at the Radio Station was a part of  his official duty which he had carried out as per  direction of his commanding officer. In view of the  above, the learned Counsel concluded that the  learned Judges of the High Court Division erred in  law in maintaining his conviction and sentence.    ",
      "678. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, learned  Counsel appearing for the appellants Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) argues that  there is no evidence in support of the charge of mur-  der of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and  others against them. Learned Counsel further argues  that PW 1 is not an eye-witness of the occurrence  and Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Artillery) is not an FIR named accused, whose  inclusion in the case is a product of concoction for  which he is entitled to get the benefit of doubt.  Learned Counsel submitted that the story of hoisting  the flag and playing bugle in the house of  Bangabandhu just immediate before the occurrence  as stated by the witnesses was not believable one  since PWs 1-3 stated that the assailants were already  in the house of Bangabandhu. There is no reliable  evidence on record, learned Counsel submits, about  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman’s pres-  ence in the house of Bangabandhu at the relevant  time. In this connection the learned Counsel has  drawn our attention to certain portions of the evi-  dence of PWs 14 and 23. Learned Counsel further  contended that in view of withholding of tank crews,  an adverse presumption may be drawn against the  prosecution that if they were produced they would  not have supported the prosecution case. Learned  Counsel further contended that in view of the evi-  dence as revealed from the lips of the prosecution  Witnesses that the real planner of the incident was  Jobaida Rashid, it was evident that the appellants  had no common intention or preconcert mind of  their being involved in the incident and therefore,  the conviction of the appellants under sections  302/34 was illegal. Learned Counsel further argued  that the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Artillery) with cannon at Kalabagan play  ground had not been substantiated by adducing reli-  able evidence.                  ",
      "677. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun,  learned  Counsel appearing for the appellant Major Bazlul  Huda and Major AKM Mohiuddin (Lancer) argues  that there is no reliable evidence in support of the  prosecution story that these appellants have been  recognised by PWs 1 and 4 at the place of occur-  rence and that the allegation that Major Huda shot to  death Sheikh Kamal and Bangabandhu as alleged is  also based on contradictory evidence on record and  therefore, the learned Judges of the High Court  Division erred in law in maintaining his conviction  and sentence. The learned Counsel has taken us to  the evidence on record and argues that the prosecu-  tion has withheld vital witnesses such as, Sheikh  Yunus Ali, Colonel Moshiud Doula and Colonel  Mahmudul Hasan purposely as they would have  been unfavourable to the prosecution and therefore,  an adverse inference may be drawn against the pros-  ecution for, withholding those vital witnesses.  Learned Counsel further contends that the allegation  that Major Mohiuddin (Lancer) has taken  Bangabandhu down from the first floor is based on  no reliable evidence on record and that his recogni-  tion by the witnesses at the place of occurrence is  totally absurd and unbelievable story. In this con-  nection learned Counsel has drawn our attention to  the evidence of PWs 1, 4, 5,6,7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22  and 42. Learned Counsel has tried to make out a  case that there are contradictory evidence on record  regarding the presence of Bazlul Huda and    Mohiuddin Ahmed at the place of occurrence but the  High Court Division has totally ignored this ‘aspect  of the matter. The learned Counsel has referred the  cases of Nurul Islam vs State , 43 DLR (AD) 6  Hazrat Khan @ Hazrat Ali vs State, 54 DLR 636,  Moslemuddin vs State, 38 DLR (AD) 311, Safdor Ali  vs Crown, 5 DLR (FC)107 and Moyezuddin vs State  31 DLR (AD) 37 in support of his contention.    ",
      "676. Therefore, I find that there is uniform  views of the Supreme Courts of Bangladesh and  India that if an extrajudicial confession is reliable                  and the evidence of such confession comes from the  lips of a witness who is unbiased the same can be  relied upon and a conviction can be founded there-  on. In the case in hand I find that PWs 8 and 15 are  neutral witnesses and they have proved the admis-  sions of four appellants about their participation in  the camage. The defence failed to bring anything by  eross examining them to indicate that they have a  motive for attributing unbelievable statements to the  accused, rather they have not challenged their state-  ments. The statements disclosed by those witnesses  were clear and conveyed that the four appellants and  others were the perpetrators of murder. Their state-  ments are corroborated by other evidence on record.  These accused appellants can be convicted relying  upon these extra judicial confessions as well.    Charge of murder    ",
      "675. Now the question is, whether this extra  judicial confession deposed by the witness can be  the sole basis for conviction of the accused. The  Supreme Court of India considered case of Sahog  (supra) and other decisions (AIR 1974 SC 1545,  (1975) 1 SCR 747, AIR 1975 SC 258, AIR 1966 SC  40 and AIR 1977 SC 2274) Desai, J and was of the  view that there is neither any rule nor of prudence  that evidence furnished by extra judicial confession  cannot be relied upon unless corroborated by some  other credible evidence. The Supreme Count  observed as follows:  <br>  “It thus appears that extra-judicial confes-  sion appears to have been treated as a weak  piece of evidence but there is no rule of law nor  tule of prudence that it cannot be acted upon  unless corroborated. If the evidence about  extra-judicial confession comes from the mouth  of witness/witnesses who appear to be unbi-  ased, not even remotely inimical to the accused,  and in respect of whom nothing is brought out  which may tend to indicate that he may have a  motive for attributing an untruthful statement to  the accused; the words spoken to by the witness  are clear, unambiguous and unmistakably con-  vey that the accused is the perpetrator of the  crime and nothing is omitted by the witness  which may militate against it, then after sub-  jecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous  test, on the touchstone of credibility, if it passes  the test, the extra-judicial confession can be  accepted and can be the basis of a conviction. In  such a situation to go in search of corroboration  itself tends to cast a shadow of doubt over the  evidence, If the evidence of extra-judicial con-  fession is reliable, trustworthy and beyond  reproach the same can be relied upon and a con-  viction can be founded thereon.”    ",
      "674. Mr Ajmalul Hossain, QC has referred the  case of State of UP vs MK Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48  on this point of admissibility of extra judicial con-  fession. In that case the accused killed his wife and  two children, The accused was seen sitting in the  adjoining room and on seeing him one witness  asked him what has been found about the murder. In  reply the accused reclaimed to God to excuse him    that “he had committed mistake as he had murdereg  his wife and two children.” The learned Sessions  Judge reproduced the disclosure of the accused to  the witness as follows:  <br>  “Oh God, pardon me, I have done blunder  I have murdered my wife and children.”    ",
      "673. There is difference in the disclosure of  extra judicial confession by PWs 8 and 15.  Whatever admission made by Major Bazlul Huda to  PW § was direct in nature, and the other one made  by 9 accused was heard by PW 15 is indirect in  nature. The evidentiary values of both of them are  same. Major Bazlul Huda was confronted with his  confession made to PW 8 in course of his examina-  tion under section 342. Except Major  AKMMohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer), other three  appellants had been confronted with their statements  proved by PW 15 in course of their examination  under section 342 of the Code. They did not chal-  lenge the said statements by giving any suggestion  or by cross examining him. Thus the said statements  may be used against them as legal evidence. These  extra-judicial confessions may in law validly form  the sole basis of conviction if the Court believes  them as true and voluntary against Major Bazlul  Huda, Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman, Major  Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) and Lieutenant Colonel  Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan as observed in Minhun  Ali alias Gul Hassan’s case. The learned Judges of  the High Court Division have ignored these impor-  tant pieces of evidence while finding the appellants  guilty of the charges.    ",
      "672. In Sahoo vs State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR  1966 SC 40 the convict Sahoo developed illicit inti-  macy with his daughter-in-law Sundar Patti (son’s  wife). There was quarrel between them on the pre-  vious night of the occurrence and Sundar Patti ran  away to the house of one Md Abdullah, a neighbour.  The convict brought her back and passed the night  with her in one room of their house. On the morning  of the date of occurrence Sundar Patti was found  with injuries in the room and the convict was not  found present. Sundar Patti was admitted to the hos-  pital in the afternoon and she died after 12/13 days.  The convict Sahoo was put on trial for the charge of  murder, The evidence produced by the prosecution  was an extrajudicial confession and circumstantial  evidence, The extrajudicial confession was proved  by 4 witnesses stating that on the fateful morning at  6-00 AM they saw that the convict was going out of  his house murmuring that “he had finished Sundar  Patti and thereby finished the daily quarrels.” The  question arose as to whether the mutterings of the  accused proved by four witnesses could be taken as  extra judicial confession. Subba Rao, J speaking for  the Supreme Court of India argued as under:    “But there is a clear distinction between the  admissibility of evidence and the weight to be  attached to it. A confessional soliloquy is a  direct piece of evidence. It may be an expres-  sion of conflict of emotion, a conscious effort to  stifle the pricked conscience; and argument to  find excuse or justification for his act; or a pen-  itent or remorseful act of exaggeration of his                   part in the crime. The tone may be soft and low;  the words may be confused; they may be capa-  ble of conflicting interpretations depending on  the witnesses, whether they are biased or hon-  est, intelligent or ignorant, imaginative or pro-  saic, as the case may be. Generally they are  mutterings of a confused mind. Before such  evidence can be accepted, it must be established  by cogent evidence what were the exact words  used by the accused. Even if so much was  established, prudence and justice demand that  such evidence cannot be made the sole ground  of conviction. It may be used only as a corrob-  orative piece of evidence.”    ",
      "671. From the above arguments of law of the  authors on Evidence, I find that a declaration, state-  ment or muttering of an accused if it discloses an  offence of guilt can be admitted in evidence against  him on proof by the person who heard it.    ",
      "670. Phipson on Evidence, 7th Edition stated  the following passage;  <br>  “A statement which the prisoner had heen  overheard muttering to himself, if otherwise  than in his sleep, is admissible against him, if  independently proved.”    ",
      "669. WM Best in “The Principles of Law of  Evidence” discussed on the same point as follows:  <br>  “Words addressed to others, and writing,  are no doubt the most usual forms; but words  uttered in soliloquy seem equally receivable”.    ",
      "668. The appellant Bazlul Huda has admitted  to PW § that he has shot to death Sheik Kamal and  Bangabandhu, The other appellants except  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin (Artillery) in  unequivocal terms have disclosed that they have  killed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and  other members of his family including Colenel  Jamil. It is also fact that these statements have not  been communicated to PW 15 but he has over heard  the same while they have been swaggering for their  heroic act of killing and change of the Government  at a time when the preparation for the oath taking  ceremony for the new Government at Bangabhaban  was progressing. These statements clearly disclosed  the killing of the President and other members of his  family and the persons involved in the killing.  Admissions and confessions are dealt with in sec-  tions 24-30 of the Evidence Act about its admissi-  bility. These are exceptions to the general rule of  evidence and they are placed in the category of “rel-  evant fact” since they are declarations against the  maker, the probative value of such admissions or  confessions do not depend upon its communication  to another and they can be admitted into evidence if  they are proved by a witness, A confessional solilo-  guy is an expression of conflict of emotion, a con-  scious effort to stifle the pricked conscience; or a  joyous perception for the act is a direct piece of evi-  dence. In this case the accused persons expressed  joyous perception for being the killers of the  President and the remaining members of his family.  They did not hide their act of killing and disclosed it  in the Bangabhaban where many dignitaries were  present on the occasion of oath taking ceremony of  the new President. In “A Treatise on the Law of  Evidence” by Taylor, the author argued the doctrine  of confession as follows: “What the accused has  been overheard muttering to himself, or saying to  his wife or to any other person in confidence, will be  receivable in evidence.”    ",
      "667. PW 15 stated, in the Bangabhaban fe  noticed from the conversation of Major Syed  Faruque Rahman, Major Khondker Abdur Rashid,  Major Sultan Shahriar, Major Shariful Hoque  Dalim, Major Aziz Pasha, Major Mohiuddin  (Lancer), Major Bazlul Huda and others that they  killed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with  his family i.e. his wife, his three sons, the wives of  two sons, Sheikh Naser and Colenel Jamil and thay  they staggeringly disclosed that for the interest of  the country they killed them. They have not denied  those statements by cross-examining this witness or  by giving him any suggestion. Lieutenant Colonel  Sultan Shahriar Rashid gave the suggestion to this  witness in an evasive manner but he also did not  directly challenge this statement of this witness,  These are uncontroverted statements and these  statements clearly suggest that those four appellants  and other co-accused are responsible for the killing.  Now, the question is, whether these statements can  be taken as extra judicial confession since they have  not communicated to this witness that they have  killed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and  his family members. Learned Counsels contend that  these statements cannot be considered at this belat-  ed stage since the Court’s below have not consid-  ered the same. These are uncontroverted reliable  evidence on record relating to the occurrence and |  find no cogent ground to discard them and decide  the case excluding them. The range of facts which  may be given in evidence having been defined in  part I of the Evidence Act, it proceeds in part II to  deal with the manner in which facts receivable in  evidence under part I may be given in evidence. It is  a fundamental rule that unless there is some pre-  sumption as to the existence of a fact, its existence  must be proved to the satisfaction of the Court.  Therefore, the party who wishes the Court to believe  the existence of a fact, must prove it. There are.  however, two exceptions-these are (1) a fact which  is admitted by the other party need not be proved.  and (2) facts of which the Court shall take judicial  notice, need not be proved. Here a fact which is rel-  evant for the determination of the charge relating to                    the incident to which they have faced trial has been  admitted by the accused and thus there is no legal  par in considering these evidence,    ",
      "665. PW 8 was serving in the army in the rank  of Captain during the relevant time. As per order of  the commanding officers this witness along with  two other officers went to Bangabandhu’s house for  ascertaining the real position prevailing there.  Accordingly, he visited Bangabandhu’s residence on  15th August at about 8-45 AM. He stated that Major  Noor Chowdhury and Major Bazlul Huda received  them and thereupon Major Bazlul Huda took him  inside the house, and in course of conversation  Bazlul Huda replied to the queries made to him.    666, Major Bazlul Huda admitted to this wit-  ness that he killed Sheikh Kamal because he was  passing information about the incident outside. He  also admitted that they killed one security personnel  as he was altercating with them and thereafter, on  query about the cause for the killing of Sheikh  Naser, Major Huda remained silent. On further  query about the killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh    Mujibur Rahman, he replied that as the  Bangabandhu queried to him why they came there  and wanted to know the whereabouts of Shafiullah  and pushed him away they shot him. On further  query about the killing of womenfolk, Major Huda  replied that the situation went beyond their control  and that the sepoys killed them. This appellant did  not challenge the statement of this witness either  directly or indirectly about his admission of killing.  These are extrajudicial confessions of Major Bazlul  Huda in which he has admitted about his active par-  ticipation in the killing of Sheikh Kamal by gun shot  injury and then the killing of Bangabandhu. The evi-  dence of this witness remain uncontroverted. Apart  from the above statement of Bazlul Huda, PW 15  also proved the extrajudicial confession of  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,  Lieutenant Col Khandaker Abdur Rashid,  Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid, Major  Bazlul Huda, Major AKM Mohiuddin (Lancer) and  other accused, the relevant portion of the statement.    ",
      "664. Extra Judicial Confession    Even if we disbelieve the confessional state-  ments as not voluntary, the prosecution has been  able to prove the extra-judicial confessions of four  appellants which can be taken into consideration as  legal evidence and their conviction can be main-  tained relying upon them. In this connection the  leamed Attorney-General has drawn our attention to  the statements of PWs 8 and 15. These statements  according to the learned Attorney-General may be  used as the basis of conviction since these state-  ments are reliable, trustworthy and beyond  reproach.    ",
      "663. Whether a particular accused had ceased  to be a conspirator is a matter which can be det  on the facts and circumstances of the given  conspirator’s connection with the conspiracy would  get snapped after he is nabbed by the police because  he would thereafter cease to be the agent of the other conspirator, There are cases in which a conspirator would continue to confabulate with the other conspirators and persist with the conspiracy even after his arrest, and in such cases the confession can be used against the confessing accused along with other accused implicated in the confession. In this case the prosecution has not adduced evidence to show that after the arrest of the three confessing  accused, they continued to conspire with other con-  spirators remaining outside.    ",
      "662. There can be two objections to the  admissibility of evidence under section 10 of the  Evidence Act. Firstly, that the conspirator whose  evidence is sought to be admitted against the co-  conspirator is not confronted in Court by the co-con-  spirator, and secondly, the prosecution merely  proves the existence of reasonable ground to believe  that two or more persons have conspired to commit  an offence and that brings into operation the exis-  tence of agency relationship to implicate co-con-  spirator, A statement made after the conspiracy has  been terminated on achieving its object or it is aban-  doned or it is frustrated or the conspirator leaves the  conspiracy in between, is not admissible against the  co-conspirator. Fixing the period of conspiracy is  important as the provisions of section 10 of the  Evidence Act would apply only during the existence  of the conspiracy.                    ",
      "661. With due respect, I am unable to endorse  the latter views for, once a reasonable ground exists  to believe that two or more persons have conspired  together to commit an offence, anything said, done  or written by one of the conspirators in reference to  the common intention after the common intention  was entertained, is relevant against the other, not  only for the purpose of proving existence of the con-  spiracy but also for proving that the other person  was a party to it.    ",
      "660. These views have been approved in  Mogqbool Hossain vs State, 12 DLR (SC) 217. The  case against Mogqbool Hussain rested entirely on  what the other two accused were alleged to have  stated to Tahsilder at the time of offering the bribe  money to the Tahsilder for the purpose of mutating  his name in the register. At the trial those two  accused repudiated their alleged statements. The  question that arose was whether the statements of  two co-accuseds were available to the prosecution  against him by virtue of sections 10 and 30 of the  Evidence Act. It was held as follows:    \"Section 10 of the Evidence Act declares  that where there is reasonable ground to believe    that two or more persons have conspired togeth.  er to commit an offence or an actionable wrong,  anything said, done or written by any one of  such persons in reference to their common  intention, after the time when such intention  was first entertained by any one of them, is 4  relevant fact as against cach of the persons  believed to be so conspiring, as well for the pur.  pose of proving the existence of the conspiracy  as for the purpose of showing that any such per-  son was a party to it. A plain reading of this sec-  tion makes it clear that apart from the act or  statement of the coconspirator, some primafacie  evidence must exist of the antecedent conspira-  cy in order to attract section 10. Such evidence  of a pre-existing conspiracy between the appel-  lant and the two Revenue Officer is conspicu-  ous by its absence in this case.”    ",
      "659. Similar views have been taken in  Baburao Bajiroa Patil vs State of Maharashtra,  (1971)3 SCC 432. It has been observed as follows:    “After having so held the confessional  statements of the co-accused, in our opinion,  could legitimately be taken into account by the  Court to receive assurance to its conclusion. In  regard to the appellant’s presence at Angar on  the moming of December 7, 1961 and in regard  to the request by Rangya, Shankar and Kalyan  to the appellant to help and protect them, the  confessional statements of the co-accused could  also be appropriately taken into consideration  as provided by section 30 of the Indian  Evidence Act. In a case of conspiracy in which  only circumstantial evidence is forthcoming,  when the broad-features are proved by trust-  worthy evidence connecting all the links of a  complete chain, then on isolated event the con-  fessional statements of the co-accused lending  assurance to the conclusions of the Court can be  considered as relevant material and the princi-  ple laid down in the case of Haricharan Kumri  (supra) would not vitiate the proceedings”.    ",
      "658. In State of Maharashtra vs Damu (2000)  6 SCC 269 = AIR 2000 SC 1691 co-accused Balu  Jashi made a confessional statement wherein he had  implicated two other accused persons. The Supreme  Court used the confessional statement of co-accused  as corroborative evidence since the confessing  accused has said in reference to the common interest  of the conspirators. It has been observed as follows:    “In this case there can be no doubt, relying  on Ex. 88 that there are reasonable grounds to  believe that all the four accused have conspired  together to commit the offences of abduction  and murders of the children involved in this  case. So what these accused have spoken to  each other in reference to their common inten-  tion as could be gathered from Ex.88 can be  regarded as relevant facts falling within the  purview of section 10 of the Evidence Act. It is  not necessary that a witness should have  deposed to the fact so transpired between the  conspirators. A dialogue between them could be  proved through any other legally permitted  mode. When Ex.88 is legally proved and found  admissible in evidence, the same can be used to  ascertain what was said, done or written  between the conspirators. All the things report-  ed in that confession referring to what A-1                  Damu Gopinath and A-3 Mukinda Thorat have  said and done in reference to the common inten-  tion of the conspirators are thus usable under  section 10 of the Evidence Act as against those  two accused as well, in the same manner in  which they are usable against A-4 Damu Joshi  himself.”    ",
      "657. There is another line of views taken in  the Supreme Court of India. It is said normally a  conspirator’s connection with the conspiracy would  get snapped after he is nabbed by the police and kept  in their custody because he would thereby cease to  be agent of other conspirators. It may not be possi-  ble to lay down a proposition of law that one con-  spirator’s connection with the conspiracy would  necessarily be cut off with his arrest. Thus, the con-  fessional statement made by an accused after his  arrest, if admissible and reliable, can be used against  a confessor as substantive evidence under section 10  of the Evidence Act, but its use against the other  accused would be limited only for the purpose of  corroboration of other evidence.    ",
      "600. In Zulfigar Ali Bhutto's case, Anwarul Haq, CJ  speaking majority for the Supreme Court of  Pakistan after following all previous decisions of the  Sub-continent observed as under:    “The methodology employed in the actual  application of section 10 of the Evidence Act is  fully demonstrated in these cases to the effect  that its actual application follows and does not  precede the finding that there is reasonable  ground to believe that a conspiracy exists and  certain persons are conspirators. It merely  speaks of the use of evidence in the case, and  the section does not control the sequence in  which the evidence should be let in. It appears  that these are but only two phases in the exer-  cise of the application of section 10 of the Act,  and not two distinct and separate stages laying  down the order in which evidence is to be led.  In the initial phase and as a condition precedent  under this section, the Court has got to find  from evidence aliunde on the record that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that two or  more persons have conspired together to com-  mit an offence or an actionable wrong. After,  having passed this test, the next phase in the  exercise consists in the actual application of the  operative part of this section whereby anything  said, done or written by any one of such persons  in reference to their common intention, during  the continuance of the conspiracy, is treated as  @ relevant fact against each of the persons  believed to be so conspiring, as well for the pur-  pose of proving the existence of conspiracy as  for the purposes of showing that any such per-  Son was a party to it, In fact, this section deals  with the mode of evaluation and the use of the  evidence brought on the record. It does not pro-  vide that the proof of existence of the conspira-  cy must necessarily precede any proof of the  acts and declarations of the co-conspirators of  the accused for use against them.”    ",
      "656. These views have been approved in  zulfigar Ali Bhutto vs State PLD 1979 SC 53, State  vs Nalini (1999) § SCC 283, Mohd Khalid vs State  of West Bengal (2002) 7 SCC 334, Sidharth and oth-  ers vs State of Bihar (2005) 12 SCC 545, and State  ys Navot Sandhu alias Afsan Guru (2005) 11 SCC  ",
      "655. Now the next question is, whether these  confessions made by the accused appellants are  admissible in evidence against them and co-conspir-  ators to prove the charge of criminal Conspiracy  after the cessation of the conspiracy under Section  10 of the Evidence Act. Conspiracy means some.  thing more than the joint action of two or more per.  sons to commit an offence; if it were Otherwise,  Section 10 is intended to admit evidence of commi-  nications between different conspirators while the  conspiracy was going on, with reference to the car.  tying out of the conspiracy. This point has been  answered in Mirza Akbar vs King Emperor. Ajp  1940 (PC) 176. Their Lordships of the Privy  Council on consideration of different authorities ang  section 10 of the Evidence Act were of the view that  a statement made after the conspiracy has been ter.  minated on achieving its objects could not be used  as substantive evidence. It was observed as follows:    “This being the principle, their Lordships  think the words of section 10 must be construed  in accordance with it and are not capable of  being widely construed so as to include a state-  ment made by one conspirator in the absence of  the other with reference to past acts done in the  actual course of carrying out the conspiracy,  after it has been completed. The common inten-  tion is in the past. In their Lordships’ judgment,  the words “common intention” signifies a com-  mon intention existing at the time when the  thing was said, done or written by one of them,  Things said, done or written while the conspir-  acy was on foot are relevant as evidence of the  common intention, once reasonable ground has  been shown to believe in its existence. But it  would be a very different matter to hold that  any narrative or statement or confession made  to a Third party after the common intention or  conspiracy was no longer operating and had  ceased to exist is admissible against the other  party. There is then no common intention of the  conspirators to which the statement can have  reference. In their Lordships’ judgment sec-  tion10 embodies this principle. That is the con-  struction which has been rightly applied to sec-  tion!0 in decisions in India, for instance, in 59  Bom 839 and 38 Cal 169. In these cases the dis-  tinction was rightly drawn between communi-  cations between conspirators while the conspit-  acy was going on with reference to the carrying                    out of conspiracy and statements made, after  arrest or after the conspiracy has ended, by way  of description of events then past.”    ",
      "654. As observed above, the confession of  Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan  was recorded in accordance with law and his state-  ment about his presence at the parade ground and  from there his presence at Serniabat’s house and  then at the Radio Station is corroborated by other  two confessional statements of Licutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman and Lieutenant Colonel  Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery). His statement as  regards his subsequent conduct has been corroborat-  ed by PWs 15, 37, 46 and 47. The confessional  statement of Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman has been corroborated by the other two  confessional statements of Lieutenant Colonel  Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery). PWs 1, 4,  11, 12, 15, 21,42 and 46 corroborated his statement  in material particulars, The confession of Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) is corroborat-  ed by other confessing accused in material particu-  lars, His statement has also been corroborated by  PWs 17, 18, 27 and 34. His statement as regards his  presence at the night parade has been corroborated  by PWs 11, 21, 22, 24, 25 , 29 and 35. These con-  fessing accused have also implicated Major AKM  Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) and Major Bazlul Huda  in material particulars. There is no inconsistency  regarding participation of the appellants in the night  parade on 14th August and their diverse acts at dif-  ferent key points at or about the time of occurrence  in these confessions. There are also corroborative  evidence of PWs 1, 4, 5, 6, 12, 21 and 22 against  Bazlul Huda besides the co-accuseds’ confession  and PWs 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 21 and 22 corroborated  about the complicity of Major AKM Mohiuddin  Ahmed.    ",
      "653. A confession can be made foundation of  a conviction if it is recorded in accordance with law;  it is found true and voluntary; if it is inculpatory  in nature and if on examination of the statement as a  whole it is found in conformity on comparison with  the rest of the prosecution case. What amount of  corroboration could be necessary in a case would  always be a question of fact to be determined in the  light of the circumstances of each case. Sometimes  no corroborative evidence are available and the  Court can act upon the confession whether retracted  or not, against the maker, if the confession is found  to be true and voluntary and if it was not obtained by  torture, coercion or inducement. While considering  a confession against a co-accused whether the con-  fession is retracted or not, if such a confession is  found voluntary, such confession cannot be made  the foundation of a conviction and can only be used  in support of other evidence. The proper way to  approach a case of this kind is, first to marshall the  evidence against the accused excluding the confession                    altogether from consideration and see whether,  if its believed, a conviction could be based on it, If  it is capable of belief independently, then of course,  it is not necessary to call the confession in aid.  Where the Court is not prepared to act on the other  evidence, in such an event the Judge may call in aid  the confession and use it to lend assurance to the  other evidence.    ",
      "652. In State vs Minhun alias Gul Hassan, \\6  DLR (SC) 598 it has been observed that a retracted  confession can form the basis of conviction if the  confession is found voluntary. The observations are  thus :    “As for the confessions the High Coun, it  appears, was duly conscious of the fact that  retracted confessions, whether judicial or extra  judicial, could legally be taken into considera-  tion against the maker of those confessions  himself, and if the confessions were found to be  true and voluntary, then there was no need at all  to look for further corroboration. It is now well  settled that as against the maker himself his  confession, judicial or extra judicial, whether  retracted or not retracted, can in law validly  form the sole basis of his conviction, if the  Court is Satisfied and believes that it was true  and voluntary and was not obtained by torture  or coercion or inducement. The question, how-  ever, as to whether in the facts and circum-  stances of a given case the Court should act  upon such a confession alone is an entirely dif-  ferent question, which relates to the weight and  evidentiary value of the confession and not to  its admissibility in law.” .    ",
      "651. In Hussain Umar’s case, the Supreme  Court of India on following the dictum in Bhuboni  Sahu’s case (AIR 1949 PC 257) observed :    “At the trial he retracted the confession.  Under section 30 the Court can take into con-  sideration this retracted confession against  Mukherjee. But this confession can be used  only in support of other evidence and cannot be  made foundation of a conviction.”    ",
      "650. In Ram Parkash’ case S Jafer Imam, J  spoke for the Supreme Court as under:    “It will be clear from the terms of this sec-  tion that where more persons than one are being  tried jointly for the same offence, a confession  made by any one of them affecting himself and  any one of his co-accused can be taken into  consideration by the Court not only against the  maker of the confession but also against his co-  accused. The Evidence Act nowhere provides  that if the confession is retracted, it cannot be  taken into consideration against the co-accused  or the confessing accused. Accordingly, the  provisions of the Evidence Act do not prevent  the Court from taking into consideration a  retracted confession against the confessing  accused and his co-accused. Not a single deci-  sion of any of the Courts in India was placed  before us to show that a retracted confession  was not admissible in evidence or that it was  irrelevant as against a co-accused.”    ",
      "649. Similar views have been expressed in  Mohd. Hussain Umar vs KS Dalipsinghhi, AIR 1970  SC 45, Ram Parkash vs State of Punjab AIR 1989  gC 1, and State vs Fazu Kazi alias Kazi Fazlur  Rahman 29 DLR (SC) 271. In Fazu Kazi’s case the  observations made in Joygun Bibi have been repro-  duced and thereby our Supreme Court followed the  statement of law argued therein.    ",
      "648. The question is, whether in view of such  retraction, the confessions can be used against the  maker and as corroborative evidence against other  co-accused. In Joygun Bibi vs State 12 DLR (SC)  156, Abdul Majid made a confession implicating  him and Joygun Bibi about the murder of Abdus  Samad, husband of Joygun. The trial Court relying  upon it and the statement of one Zohura, maid ser-  vant of Joygun, both Abdul Majid and Joygun Bibi  were convicted. The High Court believed the con-  fession of Abdul Majid as voluntary which was cor-  roborated by circumstantial evidence, and main-  tained the conviction of Abdul Majid despite retrac-  tion. As regards Joygun Bibi, the High Court did not  consider the confession of co-accused Majid on the  ground that as the confession has been retracted, it  has practically no evidentiary value against Joygun  Bibi but maintained her conviction relying upon the    evidence of Johura and other circumstantial vie  dence on record. The Supreme Court of Pakistan did  not accept the proposition of law argued by the High  Court, It was said that retraction of a confession isa  circumstance which has no bearing whatsoey  upon the question whether in the first instance it wa,  voluntarily made, and on the further questio,  whether it is true. The fact that the maker of the con.  fession later does not adhere to it cannot by itsely  have any effect upon the findings reached as to  whether the confession was voluntary, and if so,  whether it was true, for to withdraw from a self.  accusing statement in direct face of the consequence  of the accusation, is explicable fully by the proxim-  ity of those consequences, and need have no con-  nection whatsoever with either its voluntary nature,  or the truth of the facts stated. The High Court was  perfectly right in first deciding these two questions,  and the answers being in the affirmative, in declar-  ing that the confession by itself was sufficient, taken  with the other facts and circumstances, to support  Abdul Majid’s conviction. Cornelius CJ speaking  for the Supreme Court argued as follows:    “The retraction of the confession was  wholly immaterial once it was found that it was  voluntary as well as true. That being the case,  no reason whatsoever can be found for the  inability felt by the learned Judges in taking the  confession into consideration against the co-  accused. It is true that if there were no other evi-  dence against Joygun Bibi except the confes-  sion of Abdul Majid, then, the confession by  itself being merely a matter to be taken into  consideration, and not having the quality of evi-  dence against Joygun Bibi, it could rightly be  held in law that her conviction could not be sus-  tained on the confession alone. The grounds for  this conclusion would undoubtedly gain weight  if the confession were also retracted. But in the  present case, Abdul Majid’s confession is by no  means the only material in the case to be taken  into consideration against Joygun Bibi. As will  be seen presently, the evidence of the maid-ser-  vant Zohur furnished a very complete and  detailed account of the movements and behav-  iour of Joygun Bibi on the night in question, and  particularly at and after the time of the murder.  Joygun Bibi has not offered any explanation in                  answer to the questions put to her on the basis of  Zohura's ence and Abdul Majid’s confession  as to her behaviour that night. She has been con-  tent to repeat that she is innocent and to suggest  that the case has been fabricated against her by  her husband's younger brother, Sattar.”    ",
      "647. The essential requirements for raising  the presumption under section 80 of the Evidence  Act as to the genuineness of a document purporting  to be the confessional statement given by an accused  in a proceeding appear to be that the statement  should have been taken in accordance with law. The  Jaw relating to the mode in which the statement or  confession of an accused person has to be taken  down is contained in sections 164 and 364 of the  Code. The examination of an accused person includ-  ing every question put to him and every answer  given by him shall be recorded in full in the lan-  guage in which he is examined, or if that is not prac-  ticable, in the language of the Court or in English;  such record shall be shown or showed to him and, if  he does not understand the language in which it is  written, shall be interpreted to him in a language  which he understands. The record shall be signed by  the accused and the Magistrate. When such a docu-  ment is tendered in evidence and it is found that a  memorandum required by section 164(3) has been  given, a presumption arises under section 80 of the  Evidence Act that all the necessary formalities pur-  porting to have been performed and the documents  become admissible in evidence without further  proof.    ",
      "646. It appeared from the record, Lieutenant  Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan retracted his  confession on Sth February, 1997 after 52 days of  his confession; Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman retracted his confession on Ist March, 1993  after 43 days of his confession and Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery) also retracted  his confession after more than 30 days of his con-  fession. There is no explanation on the side of  defence about the delay in filing the applications for  retraction. Therefore, it can be inferred that these  petitions for retractions are after thought devices for  nullifying the admissions made in the statements.  Section 80 of the Evidence Act gives sanction to the  maxim, Omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse  acta, with regard to documents taken in course of a  judicial proceeding. It does not render admissible  any particular kinds of evidence, but only dispenses  with the necessity of formal proof in the case of cer-  tain documents taken in accordance with law. The  section applies to classes of documents,  <br>  (a) purporting to be the record of the evi-  dence of a witness given in a judicial proceeding and ,  <br>                 (b) purporting to be the record of the state-  ment or confession of a prisoner or an accused  person.    ",
      "645. What section 533 therefore, does is to  permit oral evidence to be given to prove that the  procedures laid down in section 164 had in fact been  followed when the Court finds that the record pro-  duced before it does not show that was so. If the oral  evidence established that the procedure had been  followed, then only can the record be admitted. The  section permits oral evidence to prove the procedure  had actually been followed for certain cases where  the record which ought to show that does not on the  face of it do so. In this case PWs 51 and 52 have  explained the defects and the confessing accused  have been able to cross-examine them on those  points. There is, therefore, hardly any grievance on  the part of the accused that they have been injured  by reason of such defects.    ",
      "644. Similar views have been expressed in  Nalini’s case (1999) 5 SCC 253.    “Even if there is an error committed by the  Magistrate while recording a statement of the  Confessing accused if it is mere an irregularity  and if such error or defect or non-compliance has  Not prejudiced the accused in taking his defence,    it is curable under section 533, CrPC and by this  irregularity under no stretch of imagination it can  be said that the accused is likely to be prejudiced  in his defence on the merits on account of such  omission and irregularity”.    ",
      "643. In the Kehar Singh case (AIR 1988 SC  183) a question arose about the defect in the pro-  cedure in recording the confession of Kehar Singh  BC Ray, J on consideration of Nazir Ahmed’s case  (AIR 1936 PC 253) and the provisions of section  533 observed as follows:  <br>  “On a consideration of the above decisions  it is manifest that if the provisions of section  164(2) which require that the Magistrate before  recording confession shall explain to the person  making confession that he is not bound to make  a confession and if he does so it may be used as  evidence against him and upon questioning the  person if the Magistrate has reasons to believe  that it is being made voluntarily then the con-  fession will be recorded by the Magistrate. The  compliance of the sub-section (2) of section 164  is therefore, mandatory and imperative and  non-compliance of it renders the confession  inadmissible in evidence. Section 463 (old sec-  tion 533 ) of the Code of Criminal Procedure  provides that where the questions and answers  regarding the confession have not been record-  ed evidence can be adduced to prove that in fact  the requirements of sub-section (2) of section  164 read with section 281 (old section 364)  have been complied with. If the Court comes to  a finding that such a compliance had in fact,  been made the mere omission to record the  same in the proper form will not render it inad-  missible evidence and the defect is cured under  section 463 but when there is noncompliance of  the mandatory requirement of section 164(2),  Criminal Procedure Code and it comes out in  evidence that no such explanation as envisaged  in the aforesaid sub-section has been given to  the accused by the Magistrate, this substantial  defect cannot be cured under section 463,  Criminal Procedure Code.”    ",
      "642. This section provides a mode for the rec-  tification of an error arising from noncompliance  with any of the provisions of section 164 or section  364 .The object is to prevent justice being frustrated  by reason of such non-compliance. If any of the  provisions of this section have not been complied  with by a Magistrate, the document may be admitted  under this section upon taking evidence that the  statement recorded was duly made, if non-compli-  injured the accused to his defence on  the merit. If the record of the confession or the state-  ment is inadmissible owing to the failure to comply  with any of the provisions of section 164 or Section  364, intrinsic evidence notwithstanding anything in  section 91 of the Evidence Act may be given to  show that the accused person duly made the state.  ment and the statement, when so proved may be  admitted and used as evidence of the case, if non.  compliance has not injured the accused. The non.  compliance with the provisions is cured only when  there is no injury caused to the accused as to his  defence on merit. Similar views have been  expressed in Mohammad Ali vs Emperor, 35 Cel.)  385(FB) as follows:  <br>  “In view of the provisions of the sections  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, particularly  those contained in section 533, Criminal  Procedure Code, it is difficult to say that the  omission to record questions and answers is a  fatal defect, and that it is only by recording such  questions and answers that a confession can fur-  nish data which enable the Court to arrive at the  conclusion as to the voluntary nature of the con-  fession. It is equally difficult to hold that when  supplying these data or materials it would  always be “impossible” for the trial Court to  form an estimate as to the voluntary nature of  such confession. The defect no doubt is a gross  irregularity and it may in certain special cases  injure the accused in his defence on the merits,  but barring such cases such a defect is com-  pletely cured by the provisions of section 533 of  the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is open to a  Court to come to a conclusion from the internal  evidence furnished by the statement itself or  from other evidence that the statement had been  voluntarily made, and the mere fact that there  was an omission to record questions and  answers would not debar the Court from com-  ing to that conclusion. Nor can it be said that  without these data or materials it is “impossi-  ble” for a Court to arrive at the conclusion that  the confession had been made voluntarily.  Where, of course, the defect is not merely one  of recording it in due form and in accordance  with law but there is a defect that the statement  was not duly made at all, the position would be  different.”                    ",
      "641. In this particular case we are concerned  with section 533 of the Code. The first learned  Judge has wrongly noticed section 537 of the Code  in considering any error or omission or irregularities  that occurs while recording confessional statement  by a Magistrate. Section 533 reads as follows:    “533. Non-compliance with provisions of  section 164 or 364(1}—If any Court, before  which a confession or other statement of an  accused person recorded or purporting to be  recorded under section 164 or section 364 is ten-  dered or has been received in evidence, finds that  any of the provisions of either of such sections  have not been complied with by the Magistrate  recording the statement, it shall take evidence  that such person duly made the statement record-  ed; and, notwithstanding anything contained in  the Evidence Act, 1872, section 91, such state-  ment shall be admitted if the error has not injured  the accused as to his defence on the merits.    (2) The provisions of this section apply to  Courts of Appeal, Reference and Revision.”    ",
      "640. Chapter XLV of the Code deals general-  ly with irregular proceedings. There broadly speak-  ing the question is, whether the error or irregularities  has caused prejudice to the accused or as some of  the sections put it, has occasioned a failure of jus-  tice. The Code has carefully classified certain kinds  of error and expressly indicates how they have to be  dealt with. In every such case the Court is bound to  give effect to the express commands of the legisla-  ture; there is no scope for further speculation. The  only class of case in which the Courts are free to  reach a decision is that for which no express provi-  sion is made,    ",
      "639. The object of putting questions to an  accused who offers to confess is to obtain an assur-  ance of the fact that the confession is not caused by  any inducement, threat or promise having reference  to the charge against him as mentioned in section 24  of the Evidence Act. There is hardly any irregulari-  ty in the recording of the statements as pointed by  the learned Counsel. The evidence on record proved  that the confessing accused was not kept in police  custody beyond the statutory period in this case. The  first learned Judge on a superficial consideration of  the record and the evidence disbelieved the state-  ments as not voluntary.                    ",
      "638. In column No.1 of the form of the state-  ment of Licutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed, it  was mentioned by PW 52 that the accused was pro-  duced at 11-00 AM on 27th November, 1996 and his  statement was recorded at 2-00 PM Therefore, it is  not correct that PW 52 did not mention the date and  time of producing the accused and the time of  recording his statement. Column Nos. 3 and 4 of the  form are the instructions and guidelines given by the  High Court Division for following by the  Magistrates while recording confessional state-  ments. Column No.3 relates to the explanation to be  given to the confessing accused each of the matters  mentioned in column 5 and to caution him to reflect  carefully before making the statement. The queries  required to confront the accused in column 5 had  been confronted in column 6. PW 51 has duly filled  up the columns and thus the accused should not  have any grievance in this regard. In course of cross-  examination this witness denied the defence sugges-  tion that at the time of recording statement any  police officer was present in his room. Column 8  relates to the brief statement of Magistrate's reason-  ing regarding his satisfaction of the voluntary nature  of the statement. PW 51 stated that it was recorded  in accordance with law and that the accused on  being satisfied of the correctness of the statement  put his signature. Column 10 contains the time of  forwarding the accused after recording confession.  PW 51 stated that after recording statement he for-  warded the accused to the Chief Metropolitan  Magistrate on the same day with the record.    ",
      "637. Md Habibur Rahman (PW 52) stated that  at the time of recording confession of Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery), he followed  the procedures provided by section 364 of the Code,  that afier recording he issued a certificate and that  the accused was sent to jail custody. This confessing  accused also did not challenge the claim of this wit-  ness that his statement was recorded in accordance  with the procedure required by law, He admitted that  the column No.1 of the form was kept blank. He  denied the defence suggestion that the accused did  not make any confession to him or that he signed a  statement after being prepared by the investigating  officer or that the signature of the accused was    obtained by force in presence of the police and that  the statement was not true or voluntary.    ",
      "636. PW 51 stated that he recorded the con-  fession of Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan after compliance                   of formalities required under section 364 of  the Code that he explained to the a d about the  contents of his statement and that after recording  statement he issued a certificate as to the correctness  of the statement. This appellant did not challenge |  statement that he did record his statement in accor-  dance With section 364, He admitted that he did not  make comment in column No.8 of the form. He  gave an explanation that as the accused did not com-  plain to him any ill treatment he did not fill up the  column. He denied the defence suggestion that he  recorded the statement of the accused under duress  and torture after he was kept in wrongful police cus  tody or that the statement was not read over to him  and that it was not voluntary, This witness also stat-  ed that he recorded the statement of Colenel Syed  Faruque Rahman after compliance of the formalities  required under section 364 of the Code, that after  recording his confession the accused was returned  back to the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,  that on the same day the CMM acknowledged the  receipt of the accused and that he issued a certifi-  cate. The confessing accused Syed Faruque Rahman  did not challenge his claim of recording statement in  accordance with the provisions required by law. He  denied the defence suggestion that at the time of  recording his statement an ASP of CID, the investi-  gating officer and other police officers were present  in his room. He admitted that he did not fill up  columns 3,4,8 and 10 of the confessional statement  form. He however, denied the defence suggestion  that the accused reported to him about police torture  after he was produced before him.    ",

The statement appears to  me as inculpatory in nature. PW 51 proved his state-  ment.    ",
      "632. Mr Anisul Hug and Mr Mahbubey Alam,  on the other hand, contended that the first leamed  Judge while disbelieving the confessions not only  misread the materials on record, but also on a mis-  conception of law disbelieved the confessions. In    refuting the claim of the learned Counsels for the  defence, it was contended that in no case the con-  fessing accused were kept in police custody before  recording their statements beyond the statutory peri-  od provided in section 167(2) of the Code. In this  connection, the learned Attorney-General drew our  attention to the statements of PW 61 and submitted  that the appellant Faruque Rahman was taken on  police remand for 13 days on two occasions in  Lalbagh PS Case No.11(11) 75 before the institution  of the instant case on 2nd October 1996, and that  Lieutenant Colenel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan  was also taken for 15 days remand on three occa-  sions in the said case before he was shown arrested  in this case on 3rd October 1996, but the first  learned Judge without considering those facts ille-  gally disbelieved their confessions on the reasonings  that they were continuously kept in police custody  beyond the prescribed period. In view of the above,  the learned Attorney-General contended that the  findings of the first learned Judge that the confes-  sions of Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman,  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery)  and Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan were  not voluntary had no basis at all.    ",
      "631. Confession    It was contended on behalf of the appellants  that the confessional statements of Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel  Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) were pro-  cured by torture and coercion by the police after  keeping them on police remand for a long time and  therefore, the confessions not being voluntary could  not be the basis for the conviction. It was further  contended that the confessions of these accused  were not voluntary would be apparent from the rea-  sonings and findings given by first learned Judge  and therefore, the conviction of the appellants rely-  ing upon them is illegal. It was further urged that  since the learned Judges of the Division Bench were  equally divided in their opinions as regards the con-  fessional statements of Lieutenant Colonel Sultan  Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman, it was obligatory on the part of the  Third learned Judge to consider their confessional  statements, but the Third learned Judge having not  considered them, the conviction of the appellants  relying upon these confessions is illegal and without  jurisdiction.    ",
      "630. The circumstantial evidence such as the  meetings of the accused persons at the night pi  on 14th August, the communications and the trans  mission of thoughts sharing the unlawful design  which are difficult to prove but relevant in the case,  their approach to the place of occurrence and other  key points with heavy arms and ammunition from  the night parade in the early hours of 15th August,  the deployment of troops with heavy arms at key  points and in consequence of such conspiracy, their  subsequent act are sufficient to come to the conclu-  jon that the appellants along with other co-accused  hatched up criminal conspiracy to kill the then  President and other members of his family. The  High Court Division, in the premises, is justified in  finding the appellants guilty of the charge of crimi-  nal conspiracy,    ",
      "629. If the accused sets up a plea that he is  protected by one of the exceptions, general or spe-  cial, in the Penal Code, or any other law defining the  offence, the burden of proving the exception  undoubtedly lies upon him. But this burden is only  undertaken by the accused, if the prosecution case  establishes that in the absence of such a plea he  would be guilty of the offence charged. If the prose-  cution does not establish affirmatively that the  accused had done any act which rendered him liable  for the offence but the accused raises a plea amount-  ing to a confession of guilt, the Court can convict  him relying upon that plea, but if the plea amounts  to admission of facts and raises a plea of justifica-  tion, the Court cannot proceed to deal with the case  as if the admission of facts which were not part of  the prosecution case was true. Since the defence has  admitted the prosecution case of criminal conspira-  cy but fails to substantiate its plea the reasonable  conclusion that can be inferred is that they have par-  ticipated in the incident other than that has been  taken in their defence.                  ",
      "628. According to the prevailing criming  jurisprudence being followed over a century in oy;  Courts, the prosecution is required to prove its case  beyond all reasonable doubt and the defence need no prove its case. If from the lips of the witnesses jp  course of their cross-examination or from the sugges.  tions given to the witnesses the defence has been able to bring out something which is favourable to them, it will get the benefit of doubt, Though the defence need not require to prove anything, if the defence raises a special plea in support of its case, the burden to prove the existence of that fact lies upon the defence in view of section 105 of the Evidence Act. If the defence admits a fact in course of taking its defence but fails to substantiate its claim, then certainly the said fact will go against it. In this case the defence has admitted that the acts of the appellants and other accused are criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny, but it has utterly failed to substantiate its claim.    ",
      "627. From the above evidence it has been  proved that PWs 11, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 25, 35, 39  and 40 have recognised Lieutenant Colonel Faruque  Rahman, PWs 11, 12, 14 and 39 have recognised  Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, PWs 17, 18, 21,  22, 26, 27, 32, 34 and 53 have recognised  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery),  PWs 14 and 24 recognised Lieutenant Colonel  Sultan Shahrior Rashid Khan, and PWs 11, 12, 21    and 22 recognised Major Bazlul Huda at the nigj,  parade ground where they made their preparation, of  the criminal conspiracy to kill the President and oy},  ers. The defence did not challenge the incriminating  part of the evidence of these witnesses about theip  complicity in the criminal conspiracy.    ",
      "626. These are the evidence in support of the  charge of criminal conspiracy to implement the  object of killing Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur  Rahman and his family members. From these evi-  dence, it is proved that Lieutenant Colonel Rashid  arranged the joint night parade on 14th night with a  view to fulfil their premeditated plan of conspiracy.  As a part of conspiracy, the parade was dragged on  till the early hours of 15th August, and in the said  parade removed army officers also attended. The  officers talked secretly in the office of Mohiuddin  (Lancer) and then by the side of the parade ground,  they incited the jawans by giving false speeches that  Rakhibahini would attack them and it was also  pointed out that unless the President was removed,  he would declare monarchy in the country on 15th  August. They in fact, concealed their plan to the  jawans that they were going to kill the President lest  their plan was frustrated and told them to topple the  Government. They took heavy arms and ammuni-  tion like tank, cannon, etc. which could only be used  during the war time. They amalgamated two units of  army violating the established army rules and  moved with heavy artillery outside cantonment, and  deployed armed troops with’ officers at key points  before they moved to the house of Bangabandhu.

",

PW 44 stated that after the arrival of  repatriated army officers from Pakistan, dissatisfac-  tion amongst the officers cropped up over their pro-  motion, salary and other benefits, that by the same  time propaganda were circulated within the army  over the allocation of budget of the Rakhibahini,  that at that time Major Dalim harassed some politi-  cal workers on the plea of recovery of arms for mit-  igating previous grudge, that Major Dalim was  removed from the service for disorderly acts, that in  consequence thereof Major Noor Chowdhury  attacked the Government by using slang language,  that there was no provision for joint night training of  two units of army, that there was also no provision  for taking live ammunition at the night training and  that at about 6-00 AM of 15th August, he woke up  on hearing the sounds kicking on the door and on  opening the door he saw that Major along with two  other officers with heavy arms in front of the door  who declared that they had captured power under  Khandaker Moshtaque-Sheikh was killed and  wamed him not to take any action against them.  From his evidence it is found the seeds of conspira-  cy were sown after the creation of Rakhibahini by  the accused persons.

He further stated that Major Faruque told him to  take care about the regiment and to close down the  gate, In reply to his query, Major Faruque told him  that they were going to remove the autocratic  Government.

Some time  thereafter, they heard sounds of firing from the  house of Bangabandhu and at that time, as per direc-  tion of Mohiuddin they fired 4 rounds of cannon-  balls. The defence did not challenge the testimony  of this witness and therefore, his testimony that as  per direction of Mohiuddin, they installed cannon    and fired of cannon-balls remains uncontroverteg  The evidence of this witness proved that the appel.  lants carried heavy artillery with them and that there  were confidential talks between the officers,    ",
      "611. PW 14 stated that he was a member of  Lancer unit. He also attended the night parade which  continued till the late hours of 14th August. He  found Major Faruque, Major Mohiuddin (Lancer),  Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain, Lieutenant Kismot  and Lieutenant Nazmul Hossain Ansar and some  other persons in civil dress. He also noticed some  officers of Artillery unit with Major Rashid. He stat-  ed that Major Faruque directed them to fall-in and  told them that for an emergency task they were  directed to fall-in and then he introduced the persons  in civil dress as Major Dalim and Major Shahriar.  He further stated that Major Faruque told them that  these two officers would work with them and that  they were required to follow their directions and  reminded them that in case of any negligence of  duty, they would be dealt with severely. He further  stated that at about 4-00 AM, Major Faruque directed                     for moving of the tanks and Faruque commanded  ‘one tank, that the tanks started approaching at the  same time and some tanks came at Radio Station-via  Balurghat-Cantonment-Mahakhali and after reach-  ing there, Major Shahriar, Major Dalim, Major  Shariful Hossain talked for some time and then they  entered into the Radio Station and some time there-  after, Major Faruque and Major Khondker Rashid  entered into the Radio Station. The statement of this  witness that the parade continued till the late night,  that some army officers attended in civil dress, that  two units of army jointly marched with tanks  towards the Radio Station and some of the accused  persons entered into the Radio Station with tanks  proved their acts as part of criminal conspiracy.    ",
      "610. PW 13 isa member of Lancer unit and he  also attended the night parade. He stated that at the  night parade Major Faruque Rahman and Major  Mohiuddin (Lancer) were present, that the parade  continued till 3-30 AM and at that time Major  Khondker Rashid (Artillery) came to their unit and  then Moslemuddin and other army officers came  there and boarded on a truck and then they directed  them to follow them. He further stated that their  vehicle stopped at Mohakhali where he noticed the  jawans of Artillery unit were standing there, that at  that time one officer from artillery unit boarded in  their vehicle, that thereafter they approached  towards Indira Road- Mirpur Road-Satmasjid Road  and then their vehicle stopped at the meeting point  of road on the Mirpur Road. From the testimony of  this witness it is proved that the night parade con-  tinued till late night and then the troops with officers  marched towards Mohakhali where they found pres-  ence of the forces of Artillery unit there, that Maj  Rashid came to their unit at midnight and that their  vehicle stopped at the meeting point of road in the  early hours of 15th August.    ",
      "609. PW 12 stated that at the parade ground,  he found Major Faruque Rahman, Major Mohiuddin  (Lancer) and some other accused persons, that the  parade continued till 3-30 AM and thereafter, they  were asked to fall-in, that at the parade ground he  noticed that Syed Faruque Rahman, Major Mohi-  uddin (Lancer), Major Shariful Ahmed Hossain,  Lieutenant Nazmul Hossain Ansar were secretly  talking with JCO’s by the side of the parade ground  and thereafter, they came in front of them. He fur-  ther stated that he noticed three unknown officers  with uniform, that Major Faruque Rahman intro-  duced them as Major Dalim, Captain Bazlul Huda  but he could not recollect the name of other person,  that Major Faruque Rahman briefed them that on  15th August a meeting would be held at University  wherein Sheikh Mujibur Rahman would declare  monarchy, that they did not support monarchy and  that they would have to follow the directions to be  given by him and other officers. He further stated  that thereafter Major Faruque Rahman directed  them to take arms from the kote and as per such  direction; they took arms from the kote. He further  stated that Major Mohiuddin (Lancer) thereupon  directed them to board into the vehicle and as per his  direction; they boarded in four trucks and noticed  that two other trucks with jawans were also present  there and subsequently he came to know that they  were jawans of Artillery unit, who would participate  with them. He further stated that they jointly  marched via Balurghat, Mohakhali Road, Farm gate  and reached at the meeting point of road No, 32 and  that Mohiuddin directed them not to allow any per-  Sons to move through the road and that Mohiuddin  told them that if they heard any sounds of firing they  would not be frightened as they were theirs own  people. The testimony of this witness clearly proved  about criminal conspiracy, inasmuch as, the parade  continued till 3-30 AM , that there was confidential    talks between the officers including the appellants  Faruque Ahmed and Mohiuddin (Lancer), that there  was also amalgamation of jawans of two units, that  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman incited  them and that after taking ammunition they marched  towards the road in the early hours of 15th August.    ",
      "608. PW 11 stated that on reaching at the  parade ground he noticed that the parade was cop.  ducted disorderly, that at the parade Major Faruque  Rahman came along with Major Ahmed Hossain,  and then Major Faruque Rahman, Major Mohiuddin  (Lancer) and other officers went into the office of  Major Mohiuddin (Lancer), that he noticed some  persons in white dress in the office of Major  Mohiuddin, that he guessed them as officers, that at  about 12 at mid-night, he came out of his room and  noticed that the white dressed persons were coming  out from the office of Major Mohiuddin, followed  by Major Mohiuddin and thereafter, Mohiuddin  called Huda to come nearer to him, that at that time  Major Huda told Major Dalim to wait for some time  and then he approached towards Major Mohiuddin,  when Major Mohiuddin arranged uniform for them.  The statements of this witness sufficiently proved  that besides the army personnel, some officers in  civil dress came and joined them, who were subse-  quently detected as army officers Major Dalim and  Major Huda. He further stated that the parade con-  tinued beyond the schedule time. It also appeared  from the statement of this witness; Major  Mohiuddin (Lancer) took Major Faruque, Major  Ahmed Shariful Hossain, Major Nurul Huq,  Lieutenant Kismot Hashem and others into his  office from the parade ground at midnight and had  confidential discussions when the removed army  officers also attended with them. This witness fur-  ther stated that the parade was directed to fall-in  again at about 3-30 AM and thereafter he took arms  from the kote and then the Jawans were divided into  groups and at that time, Major Mohiuddin briefed  the Jawans for marching. This witness further stated  that they marched and reached at road No.32 at 4-30  AM where Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  was residing. The defence did not cross-examine                  this Witness as regards his statement that the parade  was conducted disorderly, that he found Major  Mohiuddin (Lancer) and Major Faruque in the  parade along with other officers in civil dress, that  Major Mohiuddin and those officers in civil dress  went into his office and discussed till 12 at night,  that thereafter he arranged dress for those officers  and that thereafter, in the early hours on 15th August  they marched to Bangabandhu’s house with arms.    ",
      "607. It is not correct to say that the learned  Judges of the High Court Division observed that  section 10 of the Evidence Act would not apply in  this case for proving the charge of Criminal  Conspiracy, The learned Judges were of the view  that the confessional statements could not be used as  substantive evidence in view of section 10 of the  Evidence Act. Let us examine whether there is reli-  able evidence in support of the charge of criminal  conspiracy. According to the prosecution, the  accused appellants along with other accused persons  hatched up a conspiracy for the killing of then  President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the members  of his family with a view to mitigate their personal  vengeance and also to fulfil their ambition, and with  that end in view, they arranged a night parade on  14th August, 1975, and at the night parade the  appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman  and other co-accused incited the jawans attended  there by giving different speeches which they  believed as false with malafide motive to secure  their support for the fulfilment of the criminal  object, that the accused officers compelled the  troops to take arms and ammunition from the kote  although it was strictly prohibited as per rules, that  despite that there was no provision for amalgama-  tion of two units of army in the parade, the accused  ignoring the rules with a view to fulfil their criminal  object, amalgamated the troops of Lancer and  Artillery units, that there was no convention or rule  to continue the night parade beyond 11-00 PM but  the officers ignoring the convention compelled the  troops to continue the parade till the early hours of  15th August, that in course of continuation of the  parade the accused officers secretly discussed  amongst themselves and that thereafter they along  with the troops marched towards the city, took con-  trol of the key points such as, Minto Road, Radio  Station, Rakshibahini and BDR headquarters and  Dhanmondi Road No.32, and then they killed the    President and other members of the family in a  planned manner. The Defence plea is that the Nigh,  parade was a normal part of yearly army Cerise  which had no nexus with the killing o,  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his fam,  ily members, that there was army revolt and as ,  consequence of mutiny Bangabandhu and his fam).  ly members were killed. Now let us consider hoy,  far the prosecution has been able to prove the  charge.    ",
      "606. The views taken by Subba Rao, J in  Bhagwan Swarup (Supra) have been approved by  Oza, J in Kehar Singh vs State, AIR 1988 SC1883 .  It was said that section 10 of the Evidence Act main-  ly could be divided into two parts: the first part talks  of where there is reasonable ground to believe that  two or more persons have conspired to commit an  offence or an actionable wrong, and it is only when  this condition precedent is satisfied that the subse-  quent part of the section comes into operation and it  is material to note that this part of the section talks  of reasonable grounds to believe that two or more  persons have conspired together and this evidently  has reference to section 120A where it is provided  “When two or more persons agree to do, or cause to  be done”. This further has been safeguarded by pro-  viding a proviso that no agreement except an agree-  ment to commit an offence shall amount to criminal  conspiracy. It will be therefore necessary that a  prima facie case of conspiracy has to be established  for application of section 10. The second part of sec-  tion talks of anything said, done or written by any  one of such persons in reference to the common  intention after the time when such intention was first  entertained by any one of them is relevant fact  against each of the persons believed to be so con-  spiring as well for the purpose for proving the exis-  tence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of show-  ing that any such person was a party to it. Oza, J  while concurring with the views of Subba Rao, J  observed as under:  <br>  “It is clear that this second part permits the  use of evidence which otherwise could not be  used against the accused person. It is well set-  tled that act or action of one of the accused  could not be used as evidence against the other,  But an exception has been carved out in section  10 in cases of conspiracy, The second part operates                   only when the first part of the section is  clearly established i.e, there must be reasonable  ground to believe that two or more persons have  conspired together in the light of the language  of section! 20A, It is only then the evidence of  action or statements made by one of the  accused, could be used as evidence against the  other.”    ",
      "605. Similar views have been taken in  Shivanarayan Laxminarayan Joshi vs State of  Maharashtra AIR 1980 SC 439 as follows:    “In these circumstances, therefore, we are  unable to accept the contention put forward by  appellant No. 24. We may point out that under  the principle contained in section 10 of the  Evidence Act, once a conspiracy to commit an  illegal act is proved; act of one conspirator  becomes the act of the other. This principle  clearly applies to appellant No.24 once the  knowledge of the conspiracy is proved.”    ",
      "604. Section 10 has a reference to section  120A of the Penal Code which provides:    “when two or more persons agree to do, or  cause to be done, (a) an illegal act, or (2) an act  which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agree-  ment is designated a criminal conspiracy.”    A proviso has been added which provides that  no agreement except an agreement to commit  offence shall amount to conspiracy. Therefore, it is  apparent that a prima facie case of conspiracy has t0  be established for the application of section 10 of  the Evidence Act. There must be reasonable ground  to believe that two or more persons have conspired  together in the light of the language of section 120A  of the Penal Code. In Bhagwan Swarup vs State of                  Maharashtra, AIR 1965 SC 682 the scope and tenor  of section 10 of the Evidence Act has been elicited  that as the opening words of this section indicate,  will come into play only when the Court is satisfied  that there is reasonable ground to believe that two or  more persons have conspired together to commit an  offence or an actionable wrong, that is to say, there  should be a prima facie evidence that a person was  a party to the conspiracy before his acts can be used  against his conspirators. Once such a reasonable  round exists, anything said, done or written by one  the conspirators in reference to the common  tion, after the said intention was entertained, is  relevant against the other, not only for the purpose  proving the existence of conspiracy but also for    only “as against each of the persons believed to be  so conspiring as well for the purpose of proving the  ence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of  showing that any such person was a party to it.  Subba Rao, J of the Supreme Court argued for the  preme Court as under:    “It can only be used for the purpose of  proving the existence of the conspiracy or that  the other party or for the purpose of showing  that such a person was not a party to the con-  spiracy. In short, the section can be analyzed as  follows: (1) there shall be a prima facie evi-  dence affording a reasonable ground for the  Court to believe that two or more persons are  members of the conspiracy; (2) if the said con-  dition is fulfilled, anything said, done or written  by any one of them in reference to their com-  mon intention will be evidence against the  other; (3) anything said, done or written by him  should have been said, done or written by him  after the intention was formed by any one of  them; (4) it would also be relevant for the said  purpose against another who entered the con-  spiracy whether it was said, done or written  before he entered the conspiracy or after he left  it; and (5) it can only be used against a co-con-  spirator and not in his favour.”    ",
      "603. The word ‘intention’ implies that the act  intended is in the future, and the action makes the  relevant statements made up by a conspirator with  reference to the future. Anything said, done or writ.  ten’ by any of the conspirators is admissible under  this section, if it is in reference of their common  intention, even though it is not in furtherance of  their common design. Accordingly anything said,  done or written by a conspirator after the conspiracy  was formed will be evidence against other conspira-  tors whether it was said, done, or written before,-  during or after the other conspirators participated in  the conspiracy. When specific acts done by each of  the accused have been established showing their  conviction with their common intention, they are  also admissible against other accused.    ",
      "602. The expressions “in reference to their  common intention” used in section 10 of the  Evidence Act implies that the act intended is in the  future and the section makes relevant statements  made by a conspirator with reference to the future.  This expression means in reference to what, at the  time of statement, was intended in the future.  Narratives coming from the conspirators as to their  past acts cannot be said to have a reference to their  common intention. It is thus clear that after the com-  mon intention of conspiracy was no longer operat-  ing and had ceased to exist, is admissible against  other party. Section 10 of the Evidence Act will  come in to play only when the Court is satisfied that  there is reasonable ground to believe that two or  more persons have conspired together to commit an    offence or an actionable wrong, that is to say, ther,  should be a prima facie evidence that a person Was  a party to the conspiracy before his act can be useg  against his conspirators, Once such a reason; .  ground exists, anything said, done or written by on.  of the conspirators in reference to the common  intention, after the said intention was entertaine  relevant against others, not only for the purpose o¢  proving the existence of the conspiracy but also fo  proving that the other person was a party to it. The  evidentiary value of the said act is limited by two  circumstances, namely, that the act shall be in refer.  ence to their common intention and in respect of g  period after such period was entertained by any one  of them.    ",
      "601. Anwarul Huq, J speaking for the majori-  ty of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Zulfigar Ali  Bhutto vs State PLD 1979 SC 53 observed as fol-  lows:    “In criminal law a party is not generally  responsible for the acts and declarations of oth-  ers unless they have been expressly directed, or  assented to by him; “nemo reus est nisi mens sit  rea”. This section, however, is based on the  concept of agency in cases of conspiracy,  Conspiracy connotes a partnership in crime or  actionable wrong. A conspirator is considered  to be an agent of his associates in carrying out  the objects of the conspiracy and anything said,  done or written by him, during the continuance  of the conspiracy, in reference to the common  intention of the conspirators, is a relevant fact  against each one of his associates, for the pur-  pose of proving the conspiracy as well as for  showing that he was a party to it. Each is an  agent of the other in carrying out the object of  the conspiracy and in doing anything in further-  ance of the common design.”    ",
      "600. The object of the rule is to ensure that  one person shall not be responsible for the acts or  deeds of another until some bond in the nature of an  agency has been established between them. It is nec-  essary to prove the existence of a conspiracy and to  connect the accused with it in the first incident  whether the witness seeks to give any evidence  against him, the act, or declaration of co-conspirator.  It is not necessary that it should be established by  direct evidence that the accused and other conspira-  tors whose acts, statements or writings are sought to  be given in evidence against him entered into a for-  mal consultation of agreement to commit an  offence. As in cases of conspiracy direct evidence is  rarely available, a conspiracy may be proved by the  surrounding circumstances or by antecedent or sub-  sequent conduct of the accused. A conspiracy need  not be established by prove which actually brings  the parties together. It may be shown like any other  fact by circumstantial evidence. As observed above,  in order to prove the criminal conspiracy to commit  the particular offence it is necessary to show that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the                  accused and other persons whose acts, statements or  writings are intended to be given in evidence were  members of the criminal conspiracy and if prima  facie evidence of the existence of a criminal con-  spiracy is given and accepted the evidence of state-  ment, act or deed made by one conspirator in refer-  ence to the common intention becomes admissible  against all.    ",
      "599. Indeed, if A incites B to commit a crime  and B agrees to do so, A and B will, jointly be guilty  of conspiracy. A will, of course, also be guilty of  incitement.    ",
      "598. There does not have to be direct commu-  nication between the alleged conspirators. If A com-  municates with B and C, or A communicates with B  who himself communicates with C, all three may be  convicted as co-conspirators. This rule is particular-  ly important in the light of the special rules of evi-  dence which apply to conspiracy (below). It is not  necessary that a person charged with conspiracy  should also be an accomplice. In the words of Dr  Glanville Williams;    “Mere knowledge of and mental consent to  crime about to be committed by another does  not make a mana conspirator, but quite a slight  participation in the plan will be sufficient.”    ",
      "597. Under the common law conspiracy con-  sists in an agreement between two or more persons  to achieve an unlawful object—unlawful being used  in a special sense here. The offence consists in the  combining. So long as such a design rests in inten-  tion only, it is not indictable. When two agree to  carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself.  The offence is, therefore, complete though no fur-  ther act is done in pursuance of the agreement and,  provided that the stage of negotiations has been    passed, it will be a conspiracy even “where the par-  ties had not settled the means to be employed.” Even  if the stage of negotiations has not been passed, a  conviction for attempted conspiracy may be possi-  ble.    ",
      "596. A conspirator is an agent of his associ-  ates in carrying out the object of the conspiracy, His  acts and declarations are therefore, admissible  against other conspirators on the same principle as  the acts and declarations of an agent are receivable  against his principal. The rule of evidence to prove  an offence of criminal conspiracy is provided in sec-  tion 10 of the Evidence Act. This section is an  exception to the general rule that acts, statements, or  writings of a person are admissible only against  himself and not against others. The acts, statements,  or writings of a conspirator may therefore be given  in evidence against an accused if it is shown that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the  accused and the persons whose acts, statements, or  writings are intended to be given in evidence were  members of a conspiracy. Strict proof of “conspira-  cy” is not necessary; what is required by the section  is that there should be “reasonable grounds” to  believe that the accused and the persons whose acts,  statements, or things are sought to be given in evi-  dence have conspired to commit an offence.    ",
      "594. A conspiracy is a matter of inference  deduced from certain criminal acts of the parties  accused done in pursuance of an apparent criminal  purpose common between them. A criminal conspir.  acy consists not merely intention of two or more, but  in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful  act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. When  two agree to carry it into effect the very plot of act  itself, and the act of each of the parties capable of  being enforced, if lawful, possible if for a criminal  object or for the use of criminal means. The ele-  ments of criminal conspiracy are (a) an agreement  between two or more persons, (b) to do an illegal  act, or (c) to do a legal act by illegal means, and (d)  an overt act done in pursuance of the conspiracy. In  order to prove a charge of criminal conspiracy for an  offence under section 120B of the Penal Code, the  prosecution need not prove that the perpetrators  expressly agree to do or caused to be done the ille-  gal act; the agreement may be proved by necessary  implication. In a conspiracy, persons are often  required to do various acts at various stages; even if  for the first time they come into conspiracy, at a lat-  ter stage they are members of the conspiracy pro-  vided their act is calculated to promote the object of  the conspiracy. It is no doubt true that the offence is  complete as soon as an agreement is made between  the conspirators; they would be punishable under  section 120B. The section is intended to be treated  as a continuous offence and whoever is a party to  conspiracy during the period for which he is charged  is liable under section 120B.    595, The essence of the offence is the combi-  nation of agreement, express or implied, the actus                  reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to commit an  offence, not execution of it. It is enough if it is  shown a meeting of minds, a consensus to affect an  unlawful purpose. It can be established by direct or  circumstantial evidence. Privacy and secrecy are  more characteristic of a conspiracy, than of a loud  discussion in an elevated place open to public view.  It is not always possible to give direct evidence  about the date, place and time of the formation of  the conspiracy, about the persons that took part in  the formation, about the objects which they set  before themselves as the object of conspiracy and  about the manner in which the object of conspiracy  is to be carried out- all these are matters of inference  that can be drawn from the facts of the case.    ",
      "593. Criminal conspiracy    Now turning to the point of criminal conspiracy, it is contended by the learned Counsels for the  appellants that the prosecution has failed to prove  the charge of criminal conspiracy for committing  murder by adducing reliable evidence; but on the  contrary, the evidence on record disclose a case of  conspiracy to commit mutiny to change the  Government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Learned  Counsels argued that there is absolutely no evidence  in support of the charge of criminal conspiracy for  killing Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and  his family members, rather the evidence of Lieu ten-  ant Colonel Abul Basher BA (PW 7), Lieutenant  Colonel (Retd) Abdul Hamid, (PW 9), ALD Sirajul  Haq, (PW 12), Habilder MdAminur Rahman(Retd),  (PW 24), Naik Md Yeasin (Retd) (PW 25), Md  Reajul Haque, (PW 37), Hon. Lieutenant (Retd)  Syed Ahmed, (PW 40), Col (Retd) Shafayet Jamil  (PW 44), Major General (Retd) Shafiullah, (PW 45),  Major General (Retd) Khalilur Rahman, (PW 47),  Air Vice-Martial (Retd) AK Khandaker (PW 48),  and Rear Admiral (Retd) MH Khan (PW 49), clear-  ly suggested about past transaction and in view of  the findings of the learned Judges of the High Court  Division that section 10 of the Evidence Act had no  application in the case, the existence of criminal  conspiracy is absent in this case, but the learned  Judges illegally maintained the conviction of the  appellants under section 120B of the Penal Code. In  this connection the learned Counsels have referred  the case of Kehar Singh vs State, AIR 1988 SC 1883.    On the other hand, it is contended on behalf of  the State that there are sufficient evidence on record  in support of the charge of criminal conspiracy to  commit the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur  Rahman and the members of his family. It is further  contended that the defence having admitted that  there was criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny, but  failed to substantiate its plea, the appellants could  not escape from the charge of criminal conspiracy to  commit murder. It is further contended that in view  of the admission of the appellants that they have  conspired to commit an offence, and the evidence of  LD Bashir Ahmed (PW 11), ALD Sirajul Haq    (Suspen) (PW 12), Dafadar Shafiuddin Sarde,  (Retd) (PW 13), Dafader Abdul Jabbar Mridha (Retgy  (PW 14), Resalder Abdul Alim Mollah (PW >;  Habilder Md Aminur Rahman (Retd) (PW 24) ngiy  Md Yeasin (Retd)(PW 25), Subader Major (Retd)  Anisul Haque Chowdhury (PW 35), Resalder Munsy,  Ahmed (PW 39), Hon. Licutenant (Retd) Syed Ahmeg  (PW 40), Colonel (Retd) Shafayet Jamil (PW 44) ang  Syed Siddiqur Rahman, curator (PW 53), the learney  Judges of the High Court Division have committed yg  miscarriage of justice in maintaining the charge of  criminal conspiracy to commit murder of  Bangabandhu and other members of his family.    ",
      "592. This case is quite distinguishable in view  of the observations made above that there is no legal  evidence to show that the accused persons commit-  ted mutiny under the Army Act and they were also  not tried and convicted for mutiny. In the above  case, there are legal evidence in support of the  charge of mutiny relying upon which the Court  Martial found those officers guilty of mutiny. In this  case the accused persons were not on ‘active serv-  ice’ and they did not commit a ‘civil offence’ within  the meaning of section 8(2) of the Army Act and  therefore, the criminal Court had acted in excess of  jurisdiction in convicting them. Even then, in order  to avoid controversy, the learned Sessions Judge has  accorded sanction from the prescribed authority for  trial of the appellants and other accused persons,  although their act does not come within the ambit of  the Army Act. Therefore, I find no substance in the                    objection raised by the learned Counsels for the  appellants,    ",
      "591. They received an order from a Warrant  Officer to disperse but they did not disperse. The  House of Lords refused to interfere with their con-  viction on the reasonings as under:    “I have not thought it necessary to take up  time by going through the evidence in detail.  The Court is quite satisfied that there was evi-  dence on which the Court Martial could find on  a proper direction that there was a mutiny, and  it is not for us to criticise the finding provided  there was evidence on which they could come  to the decision they did. For the reasons which  I have endeavoured to state as shortly as I can,  the Court is of opinion that there was no misdi-  rection; that, although perhaps, criticism could  be made of the words the Judge-Advocate used  when he made his interlocutory observation,  there was a perfectly fair direction and nothing  was said by the Judge-Advocate which could  have misled the Court Martial. Therefore, on all  these grounds the appeals should, we think, be  dismissed.”    ",
      "590. On behalf of the appellants the learned  Counsels have also referred the case of R vs Grant,  Davis Riley and Topley, (1957) 2 All ER 694. In that  Teported case, the appellants were convicted by a  General Court Martial held at Nicosia in Cyprus of    the offences of mutiny. On the night of the incident  a noisy outbreak took place in the barracks the  appellants held a meeting on the roof of the hot  which they were stationed and then came down and   in riotous conduct demolished the barracks’ shop as  their grievances made to the authority were not  redressed.

In the case of Jamil Huq, the writ peti-  tioners were tried and convicted by the Court  Martial under the Army Act, 1952 for the offence of  mutiny that took place in the night following 29th  March, 1981 which resulted in the death of Ziaur  (Rahman, then President of Bangladesh. They filed  \\writ petitions challenging the decision of the Court  ‘Martial constituted under the Army Act. The High  Court Division summarily rejected the writ petitions  ‘on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. The Appellate  Division in the facts of the given case observed “if  the Court Martial is constituted properly and the  offence committed is cognizable by it then the rest is  a question of fact based on evidence which is held  by all the authorities that the writ jurisdiction is not  available to interfere. This Court is only concemed  to examine the question whether the jurisdiction  under Article 102 has been conferred and once it  comes to the conclusion that the jurisdiction has not  been conferred that is the end of the matter.” This  case has no manner of application in the facts of this  case,    ",
      "588. In Major EG Barsay vs State of Bombay,  AIR 1961 SC 1762 Major EG Barsay while on active  service along with 5 other civilians conspired and  dishonestly misappropriated military stores, and by  abuse of their power by illegal means as public ser-  vants conspired to obtain military stores and com-  mitted theft. All of them were charged with the  offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act,  1947 and sections 381, 411 read with section 34 of  the Penal Code. The Special Judge found Major EG  Barsay guilty of the charges and sentenced him. He  unsuccessfully moved an appeal before the Bombay  High Court and then in the Supreme Court of India.  He challenged the jurisdiction of the Special Judge  to try him and also raised other points. It was  observed by Subba Rao, J as follows:    “The scheme of the Act therefore is sell  evident. It applies to offences committed by  army personnel described in section 2 of the  Act; it creates new offences with specified pus                  punishments, imposes higher punishments to pre-  existing offences, and enables civil offences by  a fiction to be treated as offence under the Act;  it provides satisfactory machinery for resolving  the conflict of jurisdiction, Further it enables,  subject to certain conditions an accused to be  tried successively both by Court Martial and by  a criminal Court, It does not expressly bar the  jurisdiction of criminal Courts in respect of acts  ‘or omission punishable under the Act, if they  are also punishable under any other law in force  in India; nor is it possible to infer any prohibi-  tion by necessary implication. Sections 125,  126 and 127 exclude any such inference, for  they in express terms provide not only for  resolving conflict of jurisdiction between a  criminal Court and a Court Martial in respect of  a same offence, but also provide for successive  trials of an accused in respect of the same  offence.”    ",
      "587. In Balbir Singh vs State of Punjab (1995)  J SCC 90, similar views have been expressed as  under:  <br>  “When a criminal Court and Court Martial  each have jurisdiction in respect of the trial of  the offence, it shall be in the discretion of the    officer commanding the group, wing or Station  in which the accused is serving or such other  officer as may be prescribed, in the firs,  instance, to decide before which Court the Proceedings shall be instituted and if that Officer  decides that they should be instituted before  “Court Martial”, to direct that the accused per.  sons shall be detained in Air Force Custody,  Thus, the option to try a person subject to the  Air Force Act who commits an offence while op  “active service” is in the first instance with the  Air Force Authorities. The criminal Court,  when such an accused is brought before it shall  not proceed to try such a person or to inquire  with a view to his commitment for trial ang  shall give a notice to the Commanding Officer  of the accused, to decide whether they would  like to try the accused by a Court Martial or  allow the criminal Court to proceed with the  trial. In case, the Air Force Authorities decide  either not to try such a person by a Count  Martial or fail to exercise the option when inti-  mated by a criminal Court within the period  prescribed by Rule 4 of the 1952 Rules, the  accused can be tried by the ordinary criminal  Court in accordance with the Code of Criminal  Procedure.”    ",
      "586. In Joginder Singh vs State of Himachal  Pradesh, AIR 1971 SC 500, the appellant Joginder                  Singh was convicted under section 376 of the Penal  Code by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge while  on active service and governed by the Army Act,  1950 (India), He challenged the legality of his trial  and conviction on the ground that the provisions of  the Army Act read with Criminal Court and Court  Martial Rules, 1952 framed by the Government  under section $49 of the Code were not complied  with by the trial Court, It may be mentioned here  that sections 125 and 126 of the Army Act 1950  applicable to India and sections 94 and 95 of the  Army Act 1952 are in verbatim language. His con-  viction was upheld by the appellate Court and his  objection was over ruled by the Supreme Court on  the following observations:  <br>  “It is further clear that in respect of an  offence which could be tried both by a criminal  Court as well as a Court-Martial, sections 125,  126 and the Rules have made suitable provi-  sions to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction between  the ordinary criminal Courts and the Court  Martial. But it is to be noted that in the first  instance, discretion is left to the officer men-  tioned in section 125 to decide before which  Court the proceedings should be instituted.  Hence the officer commanding the army, army  corps, division, or independent brigade in  which the accused person is serving or such  other officer as may be prescribed will have to  exercise his discretion and decide under section  125 in which Court the proceedings shall be  instituted. It is only when he so exercises his  discretion and decides that the proceeding  should be instituted before a Court Martial, that  the provisions of section 126(1) come into oper-  ation. If the designated officer does not exercise  his discretion and decide that the proceedings  should be instituted before a Court-Martial, the  Army Act would not obviously be in the way of  a criminal Court exercising its ordinary juris-  diction in the manner provided by law.”    ",
      "584. For trial of civil offence by an ordinary  criminal Court Sections 94 and 95 have been includ-  ed in Chapter IX of the Army Act. Section 94 pre-  supposes that both a criminal Court and Court  Martial have jurisdiction concurrently in respect of  an act or omission punishable both under the Army  Act as well as under any law in force. It may also  arise in case of an offence deemed to be an offence  under the Army Act. Under the scheme of those two  provisions, in the first instance, it is left to the dis-  cretion of the prescribed officer to decide before  Which Court the proceedings shall be instituted and,  if the officer decides that the case should be institut-  ed before a Court Martial, the offender is to be  detained in military custody. However, if'a criminal  Court is of opinion that the said offence shall be  tried before the said Court, he may issue notice    section 95 either to deliver over the offender  to the nearest Magistrate or to postpone the pro-  ceedings pending a reference to the Government.  Upon receipt of the requisition the prescribed officer  may cither deliver over the offender to the said  Court or refer the question to the Government for  determination as to whose order shall be final.    585, The next question, is whether in view of  section 139 of the Penal Code and section 549 of the  Code, the trial of the appellants by a criminal Court  is barred. Section 139 of the Penal Code is included  in Chapter VII which contains sections 131-140.  Section 131 provides for abetting mutiny or attempt-  ing to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from his  duty, section 132 provides for abetment of mutiny, if  mutiny is committed in consequence thereof, and  other sections are relating to abetment of other  offences. Section 139 prohibits punishment of any  person who is subject to the Army Act, 1952, the  Navy Ordinance, 1961, the Air Force Act, 1953  under the provisions of Penal Code for any of the  offences mentioned above, i.e. for the abetment of  those offences mentioned in sections 131 to 138.  Thus section 139 of the Penal Code has no appli  tion in this case in view of the fact that the appel-  lants have been tried and convicted not for commit-  ting an offence of abetment for mutiny but for a sub-  stantive offence of murder. Section 549 of the Code  is of a special nature and has the result of taking  away the jurisdiction of criminal Court with respect  to persons subject to military, naval and air force  law. The expressions “is liable, to be tried either by  a Court to which the Code applies or by a Court-  Martial” used in the section implies that the offence  for which the offender is to be tried should be an  offence of which cognizance can be taken by a  Criminal Court as well as a Court Ma * The  phrase is intended to refer to the initial jurisdiction of  the two Courts to take cognizance of the offence and  not to their jurisdiction to decide it on merits. In  respect of offences which could be tried by both the  Criminal Court as well as a Court Martial, sections  94 and 95 of the Army Act have made suitable provi-  sions to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction between those  two Courts over which I have discussed above.    ",
      "583. The killing of the then President and the  members of his family was not committed by the  accused persons while they were engaged in operations against enemy, or in military operations in of are on the line of march to a country wholly or partly                   occupied by the enemy in order to bring the  offence within the ambit of ‘active service’. In view  of the above, the learned Counsel frankly conceded  that the appellants were not on active service at the  time of occurrence. If the appellants while on ‘active  service’ committed a ‘civil offence’ they would be  deemed to be guilty against the Army Act, but on the  contrary, while committing the offence they were  not 0 active service both the Court Martial and the  ordinary criminal Court would have concurrent  jurisdiction subject to the conditions provided in  section 92 of the Army Act. Section 92 provides that  where an offence has been committed by any person  while subject to the Army Act, and he has ceased to  be so subject, he may be tried for such offence if his  trial commences within six months after he had  ceased to be so subject. A combined reading of sec-  tions 8(1), 8(2), 59 and 92 suggest that if a person  subject to the Army Act commits any civil offence  of murder against a person: not subject to the said  Act, while on active service, he may be tried by a  Court Martial under the Army Act if such trial com-  mences Within six months after he had ceased to be  so subject. The limitation of six months after the  appellants’ cessation of the subject of the Army Act  expired long before the trial of the case commenced.  Even if the limitation for such trial had not been  expired, their trial by the criminal Court had not  been ousted since the ordinary criminal Court had  concurrent jurisdiction to try ‘civil offence’ as per  provisions of sections 94 and 95 of the said Act.    ",
      "582. Section 59(1) provides that subject to the  provisions of sub-section (2), any person subject to  the Army Act commits a civil offence at any place  shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence under the  said Act. “Civil offence’ defined in section 8(2)  Army Act means “an offence which, if committed in  Bangladesh would be triable by a Criminal Coun”,  Section 59(2) of the Army Act stipulates that a per-  son who is subject to the Army Act commits murder  and other offences mentioned therein against any  person not subject to the said Act shall not be liable  to prosecution under the said Act unless he commits  the offence while on ‘active service’. The term  ‘active service’ has been defined in section 8(1) as  under:    “active service”, as applied to a person sub-  ject to this Act, means the time during which  such person is attached to, or forms part of a  force which is engaged in operations against an  enemy, or is engaged in military operations in,  or is on the line of march to, a country or place  wholly or partly occupied by an enemy, or is  attached to or forms part of a force which is in  military occupation of a foreign country;    ",
      "581. Clause (a) of section 31 of the Army Act  relates to the substantive offence of mutiny and  insubordination, while other three sub-clauses  (b),(c) and (d) relate to the abetment of the offence  of mutiny. In order to bring an offence of mutiny  within the ambit of the Act, there must be evidence  of overthrowing or resisting lawful authority of the    armed forces or disobeying the authority in such Cir.  cumstances as to make the disobedience Subversive  of discipline or to impede the performance of ap,    duty or service in the armed forces of Bangladesh,  There is nothing on record to show that the appey.  lants and other accused have collectively insuborq),  nated or defied or disregarded the authority in the  armed forces or refused to obey authority in order to  bring their act within the ambit of mutiny or aber.  ment for mutiny. The evidence on record proved thar  the accused persons instead of resisting the lawfy)  authority of the armed forces or acting subversive 1,  the discipline or insubordination, usurped the power  by killing the President, and set up their accomplice  in the office of President which act does cover the  offence of mutiny. A person will not be made subjecy  to penalties unless the offence charged is strictly  brought within the purview of the statute. .    ",
      "580. There is no dispute that this definition of    mutiny is applicable to the Army Act in view of the  definition of ‘service law’ defined in section  4(xxxiv) in the Navy Ordinance, which provides  that “service law” means “this Ordinance, the Army  Act, 1952 , the Air Force Act, 1953, and the rules  and regulations made there under.” Mr Khan Saifur  Rahman submits that the expression ‘active service’  used in section 59 of the Army Act is not applicable  in this case but he fails to explain why this expres-  sion will not be applicable to the appellants. This is  apparently a contradictory submission, inasmuch as  the appellants are challenging the jurisdiction of the  criminal Court relying upon some provisions of the  Amny Act, but at the same time, they want to ignore  a vital provision in the said Act. Mr Huq submits  that this definition of mutiny should be read along  with section 31 of the Army Act for arriving at a cor-  rect conclusion that the acts of the appellants do not  come within the mischief of mutiny.    ",
      "579. From the above suggestions given to the  witnesses, it appeared that the. accused persons  though termed the incident as the change of power  by killing the President but the succeeding Govern-  ments acknowledged their act of killing as legal one  and rewarded them by declaring them as ‘Surya  Santan’ and absorbing them in the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. They did not try to make out a case  of mutiny rather they tried to justify their action as  one of successful coup d’etat. They set up a new  plea of defence just reverse to what they took at the  trial stage in the High Court Division although there  is no material in support of the plea. Let us now con-  sider the legal aspects of the point urged by the  learned Counsels. In the Army Act, 1952, the defini-  tion of mutiny has not been given but the punish-  ment for the mutiny has been provided in section 31.  Mutiny has been defined in section 35 of the Navy                  Ordinance, 1961, which reads thus:  <br>  “35. In this Ordinance, mutiny means a  combination between two or more persons sub-  ject to service law, or between persons two at  least of whom are subject to service law—  <br>  (d) to overthrow or resist lawful authority  in the armed forces of Bangladesh or any forces  co-operating therewith or in any part of any of  the said forces;  <br>  (e) to disobey such authority in such cir-  cumstances as to make the disobedience sub-  versive of discipline, or with the object of  avoiding any duty or service, or in connection  with operations against the enemy; or  <br>  (f) to impede the performance of any duty  or service in the armed forces of Bangladesh or  in any forces co-operating therewith, or in any  part of any of the said forces.”    ",
      "578. It was suggested to Md Aminur Rahman  (PW 24) on behalf of Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman that at that time (when Major  Dalim was broadcasting the news of the killing) he  (PW 24) had knowledge about declaration of  Martial Law that Khondker Mustaque became the  Chief Martial Law Administrator. From this sugges-  tion the defence wanted to make out a case that there  was successful coup d’etat by Khondker Mustaque  Ahmed in which the President was killed. This  defence plea supports the prosecution case that  Khandaker Mustaque and some aborted army offi-  cers brutally killed the President and usurped power.  There was provision for removal of the President in  the Constitution but the President was not removed  in accordance with the said provision, As per  Constitution, the Vice-President ought to have  assumed the office of President if the vacancy  occurred in the office of President or if the President  was unable to discharge the functions of his office  on any of the grounds mentioned in the Constitution  but this time the constitutional provisions were  ignored. If there was failure of the army insurrec-  tion, the mutinous force should have been brought to  justice for mutiny under the Army Act but no such  action was taken. On the contrary, it is seen that the    perpetrators of the crime were rewarded by the  Government and the authority in the armed forces  Supported their action by expressing allegiance in  favour of the change. Md Reajul Haque (PW 37)  stated in chief that at about 9-00 AM the Chiefs of  three Services, the BDR chief, the IG of Police were  brought by Major Dalim at Studio No.2 and their  statements of allegiance in favour of the change  were recorded and broadcast. On behalf of  Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid it was suggest-  ed to Major General Shafiullah (PW 45) that there  was successful military coup in the morning of 15th  August, 1975, that in pursuance of such revolt  Khondker Mustaque Ahmed became the President  of the country, that all the chiefs of the defence serv-  ices expressed their allegiance in favour of the  change and that he could not take any action against  the persons involved in the incident. He stated that  Khandaker Mustaque declared the killers as descen-  dants of King Surya of the Surya Dynasty. In reply  to a question on behalf of Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman, Colonel (Retd) Shafayet Jamil  (PW 44) stated that it was not possible to take any  action against the killers of 15th August, that the  persons involved in the killing of 15th August were  given protection by the subsequent Governments till  1996, that the conspirators and killers of 15th  August used to stay at Bangabhaban and that they  run the Mustaque Government by constituting a rev-  olutionary council.    ",
      "577. Before I meet the contentions of the  learned Counsels, 1 would like to mention some  admitted facts in this case, | noticed that the defence  did not take any plea of mutiny at the trial by cross-  examining or giving suggestions to the prosecution  es or in their written statements in reply to  aminations under section 342 of the Code or  by adducing evidence in accordance with section  340 (3) of the Code. Since the prosecution witness-  es did not say anything in support of the plea of  mutiny, the defence ought to have made out a case at  least by way of suggestion to the witnesses that the  amy officers involved in the mutiny submitted their  charter of demands to the authority in the armed  forces and that as their demands were not redressed,  they revolted. Secondly, if there was rebellion as  claimed the rebellious force would have attacked  their commanding officer, and if the commanding  officer was involved, they would have attacked the  Chief of Army Staff but they did not attack them,  rather killed the President which proved that it was  not 2 mutiny.    ",
      "576. Mr Anisul Huq and the learned Attorney-  General, on the other hand, contend that the incident  is not a mutiny, rather it is a preplanned murder, and  therefore, there is no legal bar for the trial of the  appellants under the provisions of the Code. In this  connection, they have referred sections 59, 92, 94  and 95 of the Army Act, section 35 of the Navy  Ordinance 1961 and section 549 of the Code.  Learned Attorney-General added that the appellants  did not raise this point in the trial Court and raised it  in the High Court Division with malafide motive to  delay the disposal of the matter. According to the  learned Attorney-General, the evidence on record do  not support a case of mutiny, rather they disclose a  case of murder. Learned Attorney-General finally  contends even if it is assumed that the incident is  ‘civil offence’ within the meaning of section 8(2)  read with section 59(2) of the Army Act, in view of  section 94 of the Army Act, the criminal Court has  concurrent jurisdiction to try such offence.                    ",
      "575. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman argued that  without determination as to whether the alleged  incident was a mutiny leading to the murder of  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his fam-  ily members, the conviction of the appellants by a  normal criminal Court is without jurisdiction.  Learned Counsel further argued that the instant inci-  dent was originated from the Dhaka Cantonment on  the night of 14th August from which it was apparent  that it was a mutiny simpliciter, not a murder and  therefore, the trial of the appellants was vitiated.  There was no agreement or criminal conspiracy or  premeditated plan or pre-arranged plan, the learned  Counsel argued, within the meaning of section 34 or  section 120A of the Penal Code and therefore, the  conviction of the appellants under the provisions of  the Penal Code was illegal. Learned Counsel further  argued that when any retired army officer or any  other person not subject to Army Act joined in 1}.  occurrence on the night following 14th Aug  1975 would also constitute a mutiny within 4  ambit of section 31 of the Army Act and they ought  to have been tried by a Court Martial under the  Army Act. The learned Counsel finally argued thy  there is similarity in the killing of Bangabandhu  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and General Ziaur Rahman  and in both the cases they were Presidents of the  Republic, and they were killed by the army personnel. In case of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur  Rahman, the army from artillery and lancer units  came out from Dhaka Cantonment and killed him at  dawn on 15th August, 1975 at his official residence,  whereas, in case of General Ziaur Rahman the army  came out from Chittagong Cantonment and killed  him at Circuit House where he was staying on the  night following 29th May, 1981. Since both the  occurrences committed in the similar manner, the  appellants, if they were at all involved in the inci-  dent of 15th August, ought to have been tried by a  Court Martial to be convened by the Chief of Amy  Staff as was done in case of General Ziaur Rahman’s  killing. In this connection the learned Counsel has  referred to the case of Jamil Hug vs Bangladesh, 34  DLR (AD) 125. ,    ",
      "574. Plea of Mutiny    It was argued that the evidence on record  revealed that the killing and the change of power on  15th August, 1975 was a result of mutiny by some  army officers and therefore, the trial of the appel-  lants under the provisions of the Code was without  jurisdiction. According to the learned Counsels, the  trial ought to have been held by a Court Martial  under the provisions of Army Act, 1952. In this con-  nection, learned Counsels have referred to sections  31(a), 59(3), 92(2), 94 and 95 of the Army Act, sec-  tions 5 and 139 of the Penal Code and section 594(2)  of the Code.    ",
      "572. Among different types of felonies, an  offence of murder or an order to commit murder is  obviously illegal and immoral. Murder, rape and tor-  ture were as unlawful in Germany even under the  Nazis as anywhere else. That is why the Nazis never  tried to legalise genocide; the orders to kill the con-  centration camp inmates were always couched in  veiled terms. For even the Nazis recognised that  such conduct could never be justified in terms of  any system of law. Not only we ignored the concept  of ‘rule of law’ argued by Dicey as back as in 1885,  but also tried to legalise a crime against humanity  and rewarded the perpetrators of that crime in the  manner the Nazi’s regime turned a blind eye to the  perpetrators of such crime. This would be marked as  a dark chapter in the history of this nation. The con-  cept of rule of law is recognised all over the world,  and our founding fathers of the Constitution also  adopted that principle, but, we failed to apply the  same in the case of the killing of our Father of the  Nation.    573, The basic elements of a criminal justice  system are an impartial fact-finding process and a  fair and equitable resolution. The ethical and moral  duties of those who work within the system are typ-  ically consistent with the concept of justice. The  criminal justice system in a country is designed to  protect the citizens of the country from the  onslaught of criminal activities of a section of peo-                     people who indulges in such acts, The State as a  guardian of fundamental rights of its citizens is duty  bound to ensure the administration of justice and the  rule of law, It is in the interest of the people that the  guilt of the offender who has indulged in criminal  activity is determined as quickly as possible. But,  unfortunately, this concept has been ignored in case  of the carnage of the then President and his family  members. In order to have a strong socio-economic  system, it is important that each and every offender  involved in crime should be put to justice and his  trial should move at reasonably fast pace. The chal-  lenges before the criminal justice system are to bal-  ance the rights of the citizen as well as of the  accused while dispensing speedy and effective jus-  tice in order to ensure a welfare state for its citizens.  Rule of law is meaningless unless there is access to  justice for the common people.    ",
      "571. The preamble of our Constitution states  ‘tule of law’ is one of the objectives to be attained.  Mahmudul Islam in his ‘Constitutional Law of  Bangladesh, second Edition, in paragraph 1.84  argued “The rule of law is a basic feature of the  Constitution of Bangladesh. What the meaning of  ‘rule of law’ is as envisaged in the Constitution? It  can be seen from the preamble that fundamental  human rights and freedom, equality and justice,  Political, economic and social have been mentioned  after ‘rule of law’ as if these concepts are not includ-  ed in ‘rule of law’. From this one may argue that  “rule of Jaw’ as contemplated in the Constitution  Concerns the certainty and publicity of law and its  uniform enforceability and has no reference to the    quality of the law; the Constitution deals with sub-  stantive justice separately from ‘rule of law’, This  argument is merely academic. As there is difference  of opinion as to the actual meaning of ‘rule of law’,  the framers of the Constitution, after mentioning  ‘rule of law’ in the preamble, took care to mention  the other concepts touching on the qualitative  aspects of ‘law’, thereby showing their adherence to  the concept of rule of law as propounded by the lat-  ter viewers. If the relevant paragraph of the pream-  ble is read as a whole in its proper context, there  remains no doubt that the framers of the  Constitution intended to achieve ‘rule of law’ as  advocated by the latter viewers. To attain this fun-  damental aim of the State, the Constitution has made  substantive provisions for the establishment of a  polity where every functionary of the State must jus-  tify his action with reference to law.”    ",
      "570. When Bangladesh attained her independence, our founding fathers wanted to establish a  democratic welfare state, which would allow equal  opportunity to one and all, irrespective of caste,  colour, sex and any other form of discrimination. We  adopted democracy as the form of Government  since this is the best and most acceptable form  evolved through centuries of experience among the  people who are concerned about the dignity, rights,  and person of human race. The chapter of  Fundamental Rights was designed to ensure not  only freedom and liberty but also equality, and most  important, equal opportunity. In order to ensure that  the democratic set-up that we had adopted did not  convert itself into an anarchic state, the Constituent  Assembly framed the Constitution with certain basic  concepts, most important of which is the concept of  tule of law.    The rule of law depends upon definite princi-  ples and binding precedent, which together make for  certainty, uniformity, and predictability, which in  tum provide the foundation of fairness and justice.  The term ‘rule of law’ is closely associated with the  name of Albert Venn Dicey, whose introduction to  the study of the Law of the Constitution, is probably  the best known and most influential book on the  British Constitution ever written. The rule of law is  defined by Dicey as comprising at least three di  tinct though kindred conceptions, in the following  terms:    <br>                “(1) We mean, in the first place, that no  man is punishable or can be lawfully made to  suffer in body or goods except for a distinct  breach of law established in the ordinary legal  manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.  In this sense the rule of law is contrasted with  every system of government based on the exer-  cise by persons in authority of wide, arbitrary,  or discretionary powers of constraint.  <br>  “(2) We mean in the second place, when we  speak of the ‘rule of law’ as a characteristic of  our country, not only that with us no man is  above the law, but (what is a different thing)  that here every man, whatever be his rank or  condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the  realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the  ordinary tribunals.”  <br>  “(3) There remains yet a Third and a differ-  ent sense in which the ‘rule of law’ or the pre-  dominance of the legal spirit may be described  as a special attribute of English institutions. We  may say that the Constitution is pervaded by the  rule of law on the ground that the general prin-  ciples of the Constitution (as for example the  right to personal liberty, or the right of public  meeting) are with us as the result of judicial  decisions determining the rights of private per-  sons in particular cases brought before the  Courts; whereas under many foreign constitu-  tions the security (such as it is) given to the  rights of individuals results, or appears to result,  from the general principles of the Constitution.”    ",
      "569. A Government not of men but of laws’ is  how the American founding fathers envisaged their  new state. The earliest official document in which  the phrase appears, in the form a Government of  laws and not of men. A system of Government in  which executive, legislature and judiciary are each,  in separate hands with each essentially limited to its  own sphere of activity was regarded by the  American founding fathers as the best safeguard of  liberty. When law ends tyranny begins. These words  emblazoned over the Justice Department Building in  Washington DC. The underlying assumption in both  is that law is the very antithesis of arbitrary power,  The United States was self-consciously modeled in  opposition to the absolute monarchies of eighteenth.  century Europe. The tyranny of an autocratic ruler  was what particularly exercised the minds of the  framers of the American Constitution.    ",
      "568. What is justice? How is justice related to  law? According to Lucas (1980: 3), justice “differs  from benevolence, generosity, gratitude, friendship,  and compassion”. It is not something for which we  should feel grateful, but rather, something upon  which we have a right to insist. According to Plato,  Justice consists of maintaining the societal status  quo. Justice is one of four civic virtues, the others  being wisdom, temperance, and courage. In an  ordered state, everyone performs his or her role and,  does not interfere with others. Each person’s role is  the one for which the individual is best fitted by  nature; thus, natural law is upheld. Aristotle  believed that Justice exists in the law and that the  Jaw is “the unwritten custom of all or the majority of  men which draws a distinction between what is hon-  ourable and what is base”. The concept of impartial-  ity is at the core of our system of criminal justice.    ",
      "567. While endorsing the above arguments,  MrTawfique Nawaz, learned State Counsel submits  that there is an onerous duty upon this Court to  address the Constitutional issues arising in these  appeals and not to make them by reference to mere-  ly to statutory laws, competing statutory laws or  precedents of foreign jurisdictions, in disregard of ,  or without adequately considering the provisions of  the Constitution, especially, since the victim of the  murder is also a person created under the Cons titu-  tion as President and the Father of the Nation.    ",
      "566. Learned Attorney-General and Mr  Ajmalul Hossain vehemently criticised the conduct  of the Governments in power. Mr Hossain contends  that the justice delivery system has failed in all  respects during the relevant time which cannot be  exonerated. This failure of the justice delivery sys  tem has colossal and catastrophic affect in the coun-  try which should not be allowed to recur for the  interest of the people. This, according to him, is a  part of history that cannot be erased the entire                    administration from the top to the bottom failed to  perform their responsibilities, and this will be  termed as a scandalous chapter in our history, and  this sort of practice should be stopped forever—it  should not be allowed to repeat again. 1 fully agree  with the views of the learned Counsel. Whenever a  criminal offence is committed, then irrespective of  whether it also involves a civil injury, the offender  becomes liable to punishment by the state, not for  the purpose of affording compensation or restitution  of anyone who may have been injured but as a  penalty for the offence and in order to deter the com-  mission of similar offences and, in some cases, for  the reform of the offender. Here the matter is one of  public law, proceedings against the offenders may  be instituted by the State without the consent of any  person who has been injured.    ",
      "565. Every word and expression in the oath of  a President or Prime Minister is potent with a mes-  sage. The message has to be demystified by reading  between the lines and looking beyond what meets  the eyes. The Chief Executive of the state must bear  faith and allegiance to the Constitution. It demands  not only belief in constitutional principles but a loy-  alty and devotion akin to complete surrender to the  constitutional beliefs. This solemn affirmation was  ignored by them whenever they were required to  take legal actions against the perpetrators of the then  President of the country. They were duty bound  under the oath to protect and defend the Constitution    and to perform their responsibilities “according to  law”, But those Governments utterly failed to per-  form their responsibilities ‘according to law.’ An  offence of murder is a cognizable offence and for  such offence the officer-in-charge of a local Police  Station is under an obligation to lodge an FIR and to  hold investigation into the offence without an order  of a Magistrate and to submit his report under sec-  tion 173 of the Code. Even in cases of suicide or  suspected killing of any person, if the officer-in-  charge of a police station has received an informa-  tion shall immediately give an intimation thereof to  the nearest Magistrate empowered to hold inquest  and unless otherwise directed by the Government  shall proceed to the place where the body of the  deceased was found, in presence of two or more  responsible inhabitants of the neighbourhood and  shall make an investigation, and draw up a report of  the apparent cause of death as per provisions of sec-  tion 174 of the Code. It is also the duty of the police  officer to submit the inquest report forthwith to the  Magistrate. In this case these procedures have been  totally ignored by the police officer, which speaks  volume about the motive of the then Government. If  no case was instituted against the killers of the elect-  ed President of the country by anyone on his behalf,  the Government was under obligation to institute a  case, and as they failed to perform the constitution-  al responsibility, they had certainly violated their  oaths that they affirmed. Secondly, the conducts of  the succeeding governments in not allowing the law  to take its own course even after killing of the elect-  ed President of the country along with family mem-  bers proved that they had no respect to the rule of  law, The assailants of the then President not only  committed an offence of murder, they had commit-  ted crime against humanity by killing a child and  three innocent women,    ",
      "564. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  was not only the President of the country, he is the  Father of the Nation but the people of the country  waited 21 years for instituting a case against the per-  petrators because the governments in power during  that period gave protection to the perpetrators. This  fact justified the explanation given by the informant  that for fear of reprisal he did not to institute a case.  Under the Constitution the President and the Prime  Minister take oath on the following, amongst other  terms:    “That I will preserve, protect, and defend  the Constitution and that I will do right to all  manner of people according to law, without fear  and favour, affection or ill-will.”    ",
      "563. There is another factor which should not  be ignored in considering the delay in lodging  FIR. After the incident Khondker Mustaque Ahmed  usurped the power and proclaimed Martial Law on  20th August, 1975 and assumed the office of the  President of Bangladesh with retrospective effect  from 15th August, 1975. Thereafter he promulgated  the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975 on 26th September,  1975. This Ordinance was promulgated putting  restriction on taking of any legal or other proceed-  ings against persons in respect of certain acts;  things, committed by those persons in connection  with, or in preparation or execution of any plan for,  or necessary steps towards the change of the  Government of Bangladesh and the Proclamation of  Martial Law of 15th August, 1975. Whether or not  an FIR could have been lodged even after the prom-  ulgation of the said Ordinance was a matter of inter-  pretation of law but one would think for the second  time to file any case on the face of promulgation of  such Ordinance giving protection to the accused  from the State level. It has got psychological impact,  which is evidenced from the testimony of Colenel  Shafayat Jamil (PW 44). He stated that the conspit-  ators of 15th August and the killer officers Major  Faruque Rahman and Rashid always stayed in the  Bangabhaban; their accomplice officers stayed in  the Radio Station and used to maintain contac!  among them by constituting an unwritten Revo-  lutionary Command Council and ruled the country  under the leadership of Knondker Mustaque Ahmed,  He further stated that it was not possible for taking  legal action against the killers of 15th August as the                    killers were being given protection by the  Governments in power after the incident till 1996,  This statement cannot be said to be exaggerated,  Admittedly, the then President and all other mem-  bers of his family found in the house were brutally  killed. It was a bounden duty for Governments in  power to institute a case for ascertaining the cause  for the death if they had not supported the perpetra-  tors and brought them to justice but in this particu-  lar case, the process of law was not allowed to take  its own course, rather by promulgating Indemnity  Ordinance, they wanted to protect the perpetrators.  Initially they reinstated the removed army officers  and then absorbed almost all of them in the Foreign  Ministry and appointed them in the Foreign  Missions. The successive Governments in power not  only exposed themselves that they had tacit support  to the camage but also showed blatant disrespect to  the ule of law.    ",
      "562. The informant has implicated only 14  accused persons in the FIR of them, he made specif-  ic allegation of overt act against the appellant Major  Bazlul Huda and identified 3 other accused persons    including appellant Lieutenant Colonel Farugue  Rahman, and implicated rest of the accused Persons  from the information collected from other sources,  If he had ill motive to implicate and/or embellis  facts against the accused persons, he could haye  vividly mentioned therein the role played by each  accused person, but he did not resort to that path;  This facts show that this FIR is not tainted by embe|.  lishment or a creature of after thought, rather it is the  true version what the informant has seen at the pla:  of occurrence. What ever incriminating evidence  that have been collected against the appellants and  other accused persons regarding their complicity jn  the occurrence are by the investigating agency jn  course of the investigation of the case.    ",
      "561. In Ramjag vs State of UP, AIR 1974 SC  606; it has been observed as follows:    “It is true that witnesses cannot be called  upon to explain every hours delay and a com-  monsense view has to be taken in ascertaining  whether the first information report was lodged  after undue delay so as to afford enough scope  for manipulating evidence. Whether the delay is  so long as to through a cloud of suspicion on the  seeds of the prosecution must depend upon a  variety of factors which would vary from case  to case. Even a long delay in filing report of an  occurrence can be condoned if the witnesses on  whose evidence the prosecution relies have no  motive for implicating the accused.”    ",
      "560. The principle of law on the point of delay  is not disputed one, The consistent views of the  Superior Courts are that mere delay in lodging a  case is not a ground for disbelieving a prosecution  case, for there are various circumstances in which  lodging any case as to the commission of offence  may be delayed. It was observed in Shreekanta  Shekari (supra):    “Delay in lodging the first information  report cannot be used as a ritualistic formula for  discarding the prosecution case and doubting its  authenticity. It only puts the Court on guard to  search for and consider if any explanation has  been offered for the delay. Once it is offered,  the Court is to only see whether it is satisfacto-  ry or not. In case if the prosecution fails to sat-  isfactorily explain the delay and there is possi-  bility of embellishment of exaggeration in the  prosecution version on account of such delay, it  is a relevant factor. On the other hand, satisfac-  tory explanation of the delay is weighty enough  to reject the plea of false implication or vulner-  ability of the prosecution case.”    ",
      "559. It seems to me, the learned Judges on  assigning reasons have believed the explanation of  delay as reasonable. This being a finding of fact  based on evidence on record cannot be interfered  with by this Court in the absence of any mistake in  the reading of the evidence or by ignoring material  evidence on the point argued. It is true that a first  information report in a criminal case is an extreme-  ly vital and valuable piece of evidence for the pur-  pose of corroborating the oral evidence adduced at  the trial. The importance of the first information  report can be looked into from the standpoint of the  accused, Delay in lodging this report. sometimes  resulting in embellishment by creature of after-  thought. On account of delay not only the report gets  bereft of the advantage of spontaneity, danger creeps                  on the introduction of coloured version, exonerated  account, concocted story as a result of consultation,  Even a long delay can be condoned if the witnesses  have no motive for implicating the accused,    ",
      "558. The second learned Judge, on the other  hand, on consideration of the evidence of P    and other witnesses observed as follows :    “the most accused persons used to stay in  Bangabhaban since 15th August, 1975 and in  the name of an unwritten command council  used to govern the country till they were made  to leave on the 4th November, 1975. Still  .though they were not without influence. The  accused Major Syed Faruque Rahman tried to  force a mutiny at Savar and Bogra Cantonments  and the accused Major Khondker Abdur Rashid  tried unsuccessfully to take over the command  of 2nd Field Artillery Regiment in 1976. Again  in 1980 they made another attempt to overthrow  the Government but still no Government took  any punitive action against any of them; rather  they were all given their arrear salaries. The  accused Major Syed Faruque Rahman even  contested the Presidential election in 1986 (PW  44). So the apprehension of the informant about  his life and limb cannot be said to be unreason-  able. Under such circumstances, the delay in  lodging the FIR cannot vitiate the trial, after all  it is always for the prosecution to prove its case  on evidence,-as such, and the contention of the  learned Counsel on behalf of the appellants  about the delay in lodging the FIR has got no  substance.”    ",
      "557. There is no denial of the fact that this  case has been instituted after 21 years of the date of  incident. There is an explanation about the delay and  the learned Judges have believed the explanation  and observed that the prosecution has been able to  explain the delay by assigning cogent reason. In this  regard the first learned Judge observed as follows:    “In the present case delay in lodging the  FIR has sufficiently been explained and in view  of the matter, the contention that FIR has been  lodged after lapse of several years so charge of  manipulation and false implication can all    together to be not ruled out merits no consider-    ation.”    ",
      "556. Mr Anisul Hug, learned Counsel and the  learned Attorney-General, on the other hand, sub-                   mitted that the prosecution not only had explained  the reasons but also demonstrated cogent evidence  to substantiate the cause for delay in lodging the  FIR. According to them, the inability to lodge the  FIR after the occurrence was due to the fact that the  successive Governments expressly as well as  impliedly prevented to institute the case against the  accused persons by promulgating Indemnity  Ordinance, 1975; and that the accused persons under  the shelter of the then governments held influential  and powerful positions after the incident and from  their conducts the informant feeling insecurity of his  life did not lodge the FIR. It was contended that  Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid along  with Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman  floated a political party under the name “Freedom  Party” and Major Bazlul Huda was the Secretary of  the party; that after General Zia assumed power  rewarded most of the accused persons by appointing  them in Foreign Missions even after they declared  themselves as killers of the then President. It was  further contended that this being an exceptional case  in which the then successive Governments sheltered  and protected the accused persons, the informant  was apprehensive of his life by taking the risk of fil-  ing any case till the Bangladesh Awami League  came to power in 1996 and that as the President of  the said party did not take any step, he was com-  pelled to lodge the FIR. In this connection they have  referred the cases of State vs Fazal, 39 DLR (AD)  166, Md Shamsuddin @ Lambu vs State, 40 DLR  (AD) 69, Tara Singh and others vs State of Punjab  1991] Supp (1) SCC 536, Jamna vs State of UP 1994  Supp (1) SCC 185 and State of HP vs Shreekanta  Shekari (2004) 8 SCC 153.    ",
      "555. Delay    The next point raised by the learned Counsels is  that there is inordinate delay in lodging the FIR and  this unreasonable delay of 21 years enabled the  prosecution to introduce concocted story of impli-  cating the appellants falsely by collecting manipu-  lated evidence which caused prejudice to the appel-  lants and that the High Court Division acted illegal-  ly in failing to consider this aspect of the matter. It  has further been contended that even if it is assumed  that this delay has been caused due to the promulga-  tion of the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975, there is no  explanation for about three months from 14th  November, 1996, the date of repeal of the Indemnity  (Repeal) Act, 1996 to the date of lodging the FIR on  2nd October, 1996.    ",
      "554. From the above conspectus of the deci-  sions, we find that there are conflicting views in the  Supreme Court of India on the point as to the power  of the Third Judge to decide a case on which the  Judges of the Division Bench are equally divided in  opinion. It is worthy to note here that the learned  Counsels for the appellants have failed to satisfy us  that the Supreme Court of India overruled the views  taken in Babu (AIR 1965 SC 1467), which in my  opinion, holds the field on the point till now, The  said decision has been given by five member Judges  and the views taken therein have been followed in  later cases. There is of course a contrary opinion in  some cases constituting with two member Judges  Bench but while taking such view, the learned  Judges totally ignored the views taken by the five  member Constitution Bench. I find no cogent  ground to depart from those views as they are based  on correct construction of the provisions of law, 1  which, I respectfully agree. Even if it is assume  that the Third learned Judge ought to have heard the  reference in respect of all the convicts, the appellants could not be said to have been prejudiced  have heard the appeals of the appellants at length on  merit.    This opinion of the Third learned Judge is   absolutely in accordance with sections 378 and 429  of the Code. This section contemplated that it was  for the Third Judge to decide on which points and in  respect of whom he should hear arguments. He is  completely free in resolving the difference as he  thinks fit. The Third learned Judge in exercise of  discretionary power declined to hear the cases of the  9 convicts in respect of whom there is no difference  of opinion as regards their conviction and sentence  and he did not consider it necessary to decide their  case, but if it was necessary to decide the case of 9  accused the Third learned Judge was in agreement  with the learned Judges of the Division Bench and  could have accepted the conviction in respect of  them. The operating portion of the opinion of the  Third learned Judge is regarded as the final judg-  ment of the High Court Division. Therefore, | repel  the objection raised by the learned Counsels for the  appellants.    ",
      "553. In Akdur Raziq vs State 16 DLR (WP) 73,  it was observed “There is nowhere laid down in sec-  tions 378 and 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code,  that the Third Judge should follow or may follow the  opinion of the Judge who has given his opinion  favouring the accused.” There is no dispute in this  proposition that the Third Judge should lean towards  the Judge of the Division Bench favouring the  acquittal of the accused for, if this proposition is  accepted, there was no necessity in using the expres-  sions “such Judge, after such hearing as he thinks  fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or  order shall follow such opinion” in section 378 of  the Code.    ",
      "552. In Muhammad Shafi vs Crown, 6 DLR  (WP) 104 (Full Bench), Muhammad Shafi was s:  tenced to death under section 302 of the Penal Code.  The case came before a Bench of the Sindh High  Court Division by way of appeal and confirmation  The learned Judges having disagreed on the point  whether the provisions of section 342 of the Code                    has been complied with and, if not, whether the trial  is vitiated. The matter was referred to a Full Bench  The Full Bench decided by majority that the provi-  sions of section 342 had not been complied with and  that the trial was not vitiated by reason of this defect  as it is curable. Since the matter was referred to a  Full Bench, on behalf of the State it was argued that  the case should be sent back to a Third Judge for  giving opinion under section 378 of the Code. In this  context of the matter the leamed Judges agreed with  the contention that “the Third Judge was exercising  the authority of a Bench of Judges and that, there-  fore, he should consider for the purposes of section  12 of the Sind Courts Act not as a single Judge, but  as a Bench”. This case has no manner of application  in this case,    ",
      "551. In the case of BN Ananta Padma Nabiah  (AIR 1971 SC 1836), 3 accused persons  charged under section 120B of the Penal Code  with sections S(II), 5(1)(c) and S(1)(d) of the  Prevention of Corruption Act and sections 467 and  471 of the Penal Code in two cases, The accused  persons filed separate revision petitions in the High  Court challenging the jurisdiction mainly on the  points that the Special Judge of Gauhati has no juris-  diction to try the cases investigated by the Delhi  Special Police Establishment, that no consent of the  Government of Assam was taken, and that the inves-  tigation carried by the investigating agency under an  order of the Magistrate at Delhi was not in accor-  dance with section 196A of the Code. The Division  Bench of the High Court of Assam and Nagaland  unanimously rejected the first two contentions but  were divided in their opinions on the points as to  whether the Magistrate applied his mind to allow the  investigating agency to investigate the cases and  whether sanction under section 196A was necessary,  The matter was then laid before a Third Judge. The  Third Judge held that the Magistrate acted without  jurisdiction in allowing the investigating agency to  investigate into the matter and accordingly, he  quashed the proceedings. The question in dispute  was whether a new point as to the competency of the  Magistrate at Delhi to sanction investigation could  have been raised before the Third Judge since the  said point had not been raised before the Division  Bench AN Ray, J approved the views taken in 4/R  1970 SC 1266 wherein it was observed that “the  Third learned Judge could deal with the whole  case.” There is no dispute in the statement of law. It  is in the discretion of the Third to deal with the case  and in deciding the case if any point is found neces-  sary, he can decide the said point as well.    ",
      "550. Despite such observations, the Court did  not interfere with the opinion of the Third Judge on  the reasonings that “Since we have heard the matter  in respect of all the three appellants at length we do  not think it is desirable now at this stage to remand  the matter when only some of the appellants could  be said to have been’ prejudiced because of the  approach adopted by Prasad, J” .The Supreme Court  thereupon heard the appeal on merit and dismissed    the appeal, The cases of Dhan Singh and Sajjan  Singh have been decided in the light of the provision  of section 392 of the Code of 1973.    ",
      "549. In Sajjan Singh (1999 SCC 44). 11  accused persons faced trial before the Sessions  Judge, of them, the Sessions Judge convicted 10  accused persons under section 404 of the Penal  Code. The convicts preferred one appeal and the  State also preferred one appeal against the order of  acquittal. The Division Bench of Madhya Pradesh  High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the  State. As regards the other appeal of 10 convicts, the                   Judges were equally divided in their opinions. One  Judge gave his opinion that the conviction of all the  accused should be upheld and the other Judge held  that the conviction of 3 accused should be upheld  and the rest be acquitted. The matter was referred to  a Third Judge under section 392 of the Code who  upheld the conviction of 6 persons and acquitted the  other 4 accused. The Third Judge did not consider  the case of 3 convicts as the Division Bench was not  equally divided in respect of their conviction, A  Division Bench of the Supreme Court ignoring the  views taken in 47R 1965 SC 1467 and AIR 1970 SC  1266 did not approve the opinion taken by the Third  Judge and observed as follows:    “Statement of law is now quite explicit. It  is the Third Judge whose opinion matters;  against the judgment that follows therefrom that  an appeal lies to this Court by way of special  leave petition under Article 136 of the Constitution or under Article 134 of the Constitution  or under section 379 of the Code. The Third  Judge is, therefore, required to examine whole  of the case independently and it cannot be said  that he is bound by that part of the two opinions  of the two Judges comprising the Division  Bench where there is no difference, As a matter  of fact the Third Judge is not bound by any such  opinion of the Division Bench. He is not hear-  ing the matter as if he is sitting in a three Judge  Bench where the opinion of majority would  prevail. We are thus of the opinion that Prasad,  J was not right in his approach and his hands  were not tied as far as the three appellants,  namely, Gajraj Singh, Meharban Singh and  Baboo Singh before him, were concerned in  respect of whom both Judges of the Division  Bench opined that they were guilty and their  conviction and sentences were to be upheld.”    ",
      "548. In State of UP vs Dan Singh, (1997) 3  SCC 747, thirty-two accused persons were tried for  various offences including under sections 302/149  IPC The trial Court acquitted all the accused. On an  appeal filed by the State, there was difference of  opinion between two Judges comprising the  Division Bench BN Katju, J convicted two accused  under section 325/34, IPC and acquitted other  accused. Rajeswar Singh, J convicted six accused on  all counts. Both the Judges agreed in respect of 22  accused and there was difference of opinion with  regard to 6 other accused and 4 women accused. The  Third Judge Mathur, J who agreed with the opinion  of Katju, J State of UP obtained leave against all  accused except the four women accused on the  ground that the appeal against the accused, qua  whom State’s appeal was dismissed by the Division  Bench had become final and no appeal has been  filled against the final order of the Third Judge. It  was contended on behalf of the accused-respon-  dents, the appeal against the 22 accused whose the  state’s appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench  on 15th April, 1987 had become final, that the  appeal was filed against the final opinion dated 19th  April, 1988 of the Third Judge, that this order per.  tains to the four women accused and six others, he  special leave having not granted against acquittal of  four women, the appeal should be confined to Six  accused only in respect of which there was difference of opinion which was referred to the Third  Judge. The Supreme Court repelled the contention  observing that as there was difference of opinion of  the Division Bench, the opinion of the Third Judge  would prevail. Two members Bench of the Supreme  Court observed as follows:  <br>  “When the appeal as a whole is heard by  the Third Judge, he not only has an option of  delivering his opinion but, under the proviso to  section 392 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  he may require the appeal to be reheard and  decided by a larger Bench of Judges. This was  an option which, under the provision, was also  open for any one of the two Judges, namely, BN  Katju and Rajeshwar Singh, JJ to exercise, but  they chose not to do so. What is clearly evident  is that the appeal is finally disposed of by the  judgment and order which follows the opinion  of the Third Judge. This being so special leave  petition could only have been filed after the  appeal was disposed of by the High Court vide  its final order dated 19-5-1988. Even though the  said order purports to be related only to ten out  of thirty-two accused the said order has to be  read along with the earlier order of 15-4-1987  and, in law, the effect would be that the order  dated 19-5-1988 will be regarded as the final  order whereby the appeal of the State was part-  ly allowed, with only two of the thirty-two  accused being convicted under section 325 read  with section 34, IPC, while all the other accused  were acquitted.”    ",
      "547. In Tanviben Pankaj Kumar Divetia vs  State of Gujrat, AIR 1997 SC 2193, (1997(7) SCC  156) the views taken in AJR 1965 SC 1467 have  been approved and observed thus:    “The plain reading of section 392 (our sec-  tion 429) clearly indicates that it is for the Third  Judge to decide on what points he shall hear  arguments, if any, and it necessarily postulates  that the Third Judge is free to decide the appeal  by resolving the difference in the manner he  thinks proper.”    ",
      "546. In the case of Hethubha, AIR 1970 SC  1266, three accused persons were charged for mur-  der and other offences. The trial Court acquitted all  the accused persons of the charge under sections  302/34 of the Penal Code; it however, convicted all  the accused under section 304 Part II read with sec-  tion 34 of the Penal Code. Two accused persons  were also convicted under section 323 and another  under sections 323/34 of the Penal Code. Accused  persons preferred appeal from the aforesaid convic-  tion and sentence. A Division Bench of the Gujrat  High Court heard the appeal. One Judge Divan, J  found accused No.1 guilty under section 302 of the  Penal Code and the other two accused guilty under  section 324/34 of the Penal Code. Another Judge  Shelat, J acquitted all the accused persons of the  charges. The matter was referred to a Third Judge,  Mehta, J who heard the appeal found the accused  No.1 guilty under section 302 and other two accused  guilty under section 302/34 of the Penal Code. He  also maintained the conviction of first two accused  under section 323 of the Penal Code and the Third  accused under sections 323/34 of the Penal Code.  The convicts went to the Supreme Court of India. It  was contended on behalf of the convicts that the  Third Judge erred in law in disposing of the whole  case in violation of section 429 of the Code. The  Supreme Court of India approved the views taken in  the case of Babu (Supra) and observed as follows:  <br>  “Ths Court in Babu vs State of Uttar  Pradesh, (1965) 2 SCR 771= (AIR 1965 SC  1467) held that it was for the Third learned  Judge to decide on what points the arguments  would be heard and therefore he was free to  resolve the differences as he thought fit. Mehta,  J, here dealt with the whole case. Section 429 of  the Criminal Procedure Code states \"that when                     the Judges comprising the Court of Appeal are  equally divided in opinion, the case of their  opinion thereon, shall be laid before another  Judge of the same Court and such Judge, after  h hearing, if any, as he thinks fit, shall deliv-  er his opinion, and the Judgment and order shall  follow such opinion”. Two things are notice-  able; first, that the case shall be laid before  another Judge, and, secondly, the Judgment and  order will follow the opinion of the Third  leamed Judge. It is, therefore, manifest that the  Third learned Judge can or will deal with the  whole case.”    ",
      "545. In the case of Babu vs State of UP, AIR  1965 SC 1467, five members Constitutional Bench  of the Supreme Court of India considered the true  purport and power of the Third Judge. In that case  the Division Bench differed in their opinions in  respect of the conviction of three accused persons  and delivered two separate opinions. The case was  laid to Takru, J who agreed with Mathur, J in accept-  ing the prosecution case. The appeals of the convicts  were accordingly dismissed. On the application for  certificate of fitness the two Judges who heard the  appeals, again deferred. Mathur, J was in favour of  refusing certificate while Gyanendra Kumar, J was  for granting it. He was of the opinion that the main  point of difference earlier was over the authenticity  of the FIR, and Takru, J had merely stated that if it  was necessary for him to decide the point he would  have agreed with Mathur, J and could have accepted  the FIR as genuine. Gyanendra, J was of the opinion  that this matter which was fully argued before  Takru, J was not discussed by him in detail. The  matter was again laid before Boome, J who agreed  with Gyanendra, J on the point that Takru, J had not  gone into the authenticity of the FIR. He was in  favour of granting certificate. Before the Supreme  Court the competency of the appeal was raised, it  was observed as follows:    “The section (s 429) contemplates that it is  for the Third Judge to decide on what points he  shall hear the arguments, if any, and that postu-  lates that he is completely free in resolving the  difference he thinks fit. In our judgment, it  was sufficient for Takru, J to have said on the  question of the First Information Report that he  did not consider it necessary to decide the point  but if it was necessary he was in agreement with  all that Mathur, J had said. There was, therefore,  a proper decision by Takru, J and the certificate  could not be based upon the omission to discuss  the First Information Report and the doubts  about it.”    ",
      "544. Sometimes the Judges of the Division  Bench may differ in their opinions on any point but  if they agree with the ultimate conclusions reached  by the Court of Sessions and confirm the sentence,  it cannot be said that the Judges are equally divided  in their opinions. Section 377 provides that in every  case so submitted, the confirmation of sentence or  any new sentence or order passed by the High Court  Division, shall, when such Court consists of two or  more Judges, be made, passed, and signed by at least  two of them. This section deals with the procedure  as to the manner of signing the confirmation of sen-  tence of death where the Court consists of two or  more Judges the order of confirmation of sentence  of death should be signed by at least both of them. If  the sentence of death is confirmed by one of them,  the sentence of death is not validly confirmed with-  in the meaning of section 377, which enacts that any  order made on a reference shall be by a Bench con  sisting of at least two Judges. When the Judges con-  sisting the Division Bench are equally divided in  their opinions the case shall be decided in the man-  ner provided by section 378 read with section 429 o!  the Code, i.e. the case with their opinions shall be  laid before the Third Judge. The expression differ                  ence of opinion as used in the sections may be either  as regards the guilt or innocence of the accused or as  to the proper sentence to be passed. In either of these cases the sections require the reference to be made to another Judge, The Judge before whom the case is laid for his opinion is entitled to pass any order he thinks proper including an order directing retrial of the accused. While confirming the sentence one Judge May not accept a piece of evidence but  accepts the conviction and sentence in respect of an  accused person that does not mean that there is dif-  ference of opinion as regards conviction and sen-  tence. Therefore, the moot question is whether the  Judges of the Division Bench have confirmed the  conviction and sentence within the meaning of sec-  tion 377 of the Code.    ",
      "543. These views have been followed in  Ahmed Sher vs Emperor AIR 1931(Lah) 5}3  Subeder Singh vs Emperor, AIR 1943 All 272, Nema  Mandal vs State of West Bengal, AIR 1966 Cal 194  The views of the Supreme Court of India on the  point are not uniform. One view is that the Third  Judge is required to examine the whole case independently and that he is not bound by the two options of the two Judges comprising the Division  Bench even if there is no difference in respect of any  one of the accused persons. The other view is that it  is the discretion of the Third Judge to decide on  what points he shall hear the arguments, if any, and  he is completely free in resolving the difference.    ",
      "542. These views have been expressed in  Sarat Chandra Mitra vs Emperor ILR 38 Cal 202, as  follows:    “I am not now concerned with the question  of the trial of two petitioners with regards to  one of whom the Judges composing the Court  of Appeal may be agreed in their opinion, while  as regards the others the Judges may be equally  divided in opinion. In such a contingency it is  quite possible to maintain the view that, upon a  reasonable interpretation of the term “case”,  what has to be laid before another Judge is the  case of the prisoner as to whom the Judges are  equally divided in opinion. I am now concerned  only with the contingency in which the Judges  of the Court of Appeal are already divided in  opinion upon the question of the guilt of one  accused person, though upon certain aspects of  the case they may be agreed in their view. In    such a contingency, what is laid before another,  Judge, is, not the point or points upon which the  Judges are equally divided in opinion, but the  “case”. These obviously mean that, so far as the  particular accused is concerned, the whole case  is laid before the Third Judge, and it is his duty  to consider all the points involved, before he  delivers his opinion upon the case.”    ",
      "541. The earlier uniform views of different  High Courts on construction of sections 378 and 429  are that what is laid before another Judge is the  “case” and secondly, the judgment or order shall fol-  low the opinion given by such Judge. The opinion of  the Third Judge will be regarded as the final  Judgment. In a case two accused persons were con-                  victed, on appeal with regard to one of whom the  Judges composing the Court of appeal are agreed in  their opinions, while as regards the other Judges  were divided in opinion, in such a contingency it is  quite possible to maintain the view upon a reason-  able interpretation of the term ‘case’ what has to be  laid before another Judge is the case of the accused  in respect of whom the Judges are equally divided in  their opinions. The Courts are concerned only with  the contingency in which the Judges of the High  Court Division are equally divided in their opinions  upon the question of the guilt of one accused person,  though upon certain aspects of the case they may be  agreed in their views. In such a contingency, what is  laid before the Third Judge, is, not the point or  points upon which the Judges are equally divided in  their opinions but the ‘case’. This obviously means  that, so far as the particular accused is concerned the  whole case is laid before the Third Judge, and it is  his duty to consider all the points involved, before  he delivers his opinion upon the case. The judgment  or order shall follow such opinion which need not  necessarily be the opinion of the majority of the  three Judges. The case laid before a Third Judge is  the complete case, insofar as the two Judges who  first heard the appeal have differed as regards par-  ticular appellant or appellants, but not the case of the  other appellants as to whom they did not differ.    ",
      "540. The language used in sections 378 and  429 of the Code is almost identical. It is said that in  hearing a reference or an appeal if the Judges are  equally divided in opinion thereon, the case with  their opinions shall be laid before a Third Judge for  hearing, and the Third Judge after hearing ‘as he  thinks fit’ would deliver his opinion, and the judg-  ment and order would follow such opinion. The  expressions “as he thinks fit” used in both the sec-  tions are significant. It is the Third Judge to decide  on what points or in respect of whom he shall hear  arguments. This postulates that the Third Judge is  completely free in resolving the difference as he  thinks fit. If he does not think to hear the arguments  in respect of any accused of whom the Judges are  not divided in their opinions, he may decline to do  so. The use of the words “equally divided” in both  the sections means the Judges differ in their opin-  ions, in respect of complicity of an accused or on the  charge framed against him or them or on any partic-  ular point it can be inferred that they are equally  divided but in a case where the Judges concur each  other in respect of a particular accused and in  respect of the offence charged, it cannot be said that  Judges are equally divided in respect of the accused  charged with.    ",
      "539. Whenever a sentence of death is imposed  or passed by a Court of Sessions the proceedings of  the case shall be submitted to the High Court  Division for the confirmation of sentence under sec-  tion 374 of the Code. The power of the High Court  Division to confirm the sentence is provided in sec-  tion 376. In dealing with a submission of the pro-  ceedings under section 374 the High Court Division  itself acting on its appellate side power irrespective  of whether the accused who is sentenced to death  prefers an appeal, it is bound to consider the evi-  dence and arrive at an independent conclusion as to  the guilt or innocence of the accused. A duty is    imposed upon the High Court Division to satisfy  itself that the conviction of the accused is justified  on the evidence and that the sentence of death in the  circumstances of the case is appropriate one. There  is no statutory limit to the power of the High Court  Division in this connection. The High Court  Division considers the evidence carefully and  records its conclusions nearly after dealing with all  the points urged before it by the Counsel for the con-  demned prisoner. In dealing with confirmation  cases, it is of utmost importance that no room should  be left for any legitimate claim by the defence that  important points were argued before the High Court  Division that were not considered by it.    ",
      "538. Previous legislation may be relevant to  the interpretation of later statutes in two ways. In the  first place, the course taken by legislation on a par-  ticular point indicates how the present Act can be  interpreted. Secondly, reference to a specific phrase  in an earlier Act may throw light on the meaning of  that phrase in a subsequent statute dealing with the  same subject matter. Subsequent Acts may also be  used as aids to interpretation. This is known as “par-  liamentary exposition” that is to say, the legislature  either deliberately sets out in the later Act the expo-  sition of the earlier for the purpose of explaining it,  or does so by implication i.e. by giving a definite  meaning to the same or a similar expression unex-  plained in the earlier Act.    ",
      "537. The proposed amendment to section 378  manifestly suggested that the legislature did not  intend to give finality of the opinion of the Third  Judge. It was proposed that if there was difference in  opinion between the Judges of the Division Bench  the case would be heard by a three member Bench  and the judgment and order shall follow the opinion  of the majority of Judges so rehearing such case.  The proposed amendment was dropped on the reasonings that there was probability of difference of    introduced in the Code of 1872 and prior to intro- opinion in rare cases and that the Judicial Commis-  duction of this provision such cases were governed _ sioners? Courts did not possess sufficient number of  by the Letters Patent. There was provision for fur- Judges for the constitution of larger Bench. In order                  to speeding up the disposal of the cases, the Third  Judge has been given the power to give his own  opinion and it will be according to such opinion that  judgment will follow in the Code of 1898. In the  Indian new Code of 1973, almost similar provision  has been re-enacted by adding a proviso. The addi-  tion of a proviso authorises one of the Judges con-  stituting the Division Bench or the Third Judge if so  desires, can refer the reference to a larger Bench for  rehearing and decision by such Bench of Judges,  even if the Third Judge agreeing with one of the two  Judges. The intention of the legislature to re-intro-  duce the provision contained in the Code of 1872 is  obvious. If the Third Judge is not bound by any  opinion of the Division Bench where there is no dif-  ference of opinion, there was no necessity for the  legislature of re-introduction of the provision con-  tained in the Code of 1872 in section 392 of the  Code of 1973 as quoted above.    ",
      "536. This proviso was dropped on the recom-  mendation of the select committee on the following  reasons:    “This amendment of section 378 has been  condemned by a majority of the Judges who  have expressed an opinion on the Bill. In view  of the fact that the difficulty which the amend-  ment is intended to meet is probably of rare  occurrence, and that the second portion of the  proviso will be inapplicable in the case of  Judicial Commissioners Courts which do not at  present consist of five Judges, we prefer to  leave the law as it is, and we have deleted this  clause.”    ",
      "535. The provision of section 392 was first introduced in the code of 1872 and prior to introduction of this provision such cases were governed by the Letters Paten. There was provision for further  appeal under clause 36 of the Letters Paten  from the opinion of the Third Judge. The Procedure  laid down by this section is not a right of any Panty,  but only a matter of procedure to be adopted by the  Court suo moto where there is a difference of opinion between the Judges. The Third Judge did not  constitute a Division Bench within the meaning of  the rules of the Calcutta High Court and thus, it was  not open to him to refer the point to a Full Bench,  and therefore, there was proposal for addition of a  proviso in section 378 in the Code of 1898 in the  Original Bill as under:  <br>  “Provided that, if any Judge being a member of such a Bench so desires, such case shall  be reheard before them and another Judge or, if  the Chief Justice or Judicial Commissioner so  direct, before three other Judges, and the  Judgment or order shall follow the opinion of  the majority of Judges so re-hearing such case.”    ",
      "534. Section 429 corresponds to section 392    of the Code of 1973 (India) which reads as follows:  <br>  “392. Procedure where Judges of Court of  Appeal are equally divided—    When an appeal under this Chapter is heard  by a High Court before a Bench of Judges and  they are divided in opinion, the appeal, with  their opinions, shall be laid before another  Judge of that Court, and that Judge, after such  hearing as he thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or order shall follow that  opinion;    Provided that if one of the Judges constituting the Bench, or where the appeal is laid  before another Judge under this section, that    Judge, so requires , the appeal shall be reheard  and decided by a larger Bench of Judges.”    ",
      "533. Let us first consider the relevant provisions of law which are reproduced below :  <br>  “376 Power of High Court Division to con-  firm sentence or annul conviction. In any case  submitted under section 374, the High Court  Division—  <br>  (d) may confirm the sentence, or pass any  other sentence warranted by law, or  <br>  (e) may annul conviction, and convict the  accused of any offence of which the Sessions  Court might have convicted him, or order a new  trial on the same or an amended charge, or  <br>  (f) may acquit the accused person:    Provided that no order of confirmation  shall be made under this section until the period                  allowed for preferring an appeal has expired, or,  if an appeal is presented within such period,  until such appeal is disposed of.  <br>  “377. In every case so submitted, the confirmation of the sentence, or any new sentence  or order passed by the High Court Division  shall, when such Court consists of two or more  Judges, be made, passed and signed by at least  two of them.”  <br>  “378.When any such case is heard before a  bench of Judges and such Judges are equally  divided in opinion, the case, with their opinions  thereon, shall be laid before another Judge, and  such Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit  shall deliver his opinion, and the judgment or  order shall follow such opinion.”  <br>  “429. When the Judges composing the  Court of Appeal are equally divided in opinion,  the case, with their opinions thereon shall be  laid before another Judge of the same Court,  and such Judge after such hearing (if any) as he  thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion, and the  judgment or order shall follow such opinion.”    ",
      "532. Mr Anisul Hug, appearing for the State,  on the other hand, contended that the Third learned  Judge is perfectly justified in repelling the objection  of the convicts in not hearing the entire death refer-  ence and hearing of the case in respect of the six  accused convicts in respect of whom the Judges of  the Division Bench were equally divided in their  opinions, which was in accordance with section 378  of the Code. Mr Huq has taken us to sections 377,  378, and 429 of the Code and contended that section  377 relates to the procedure for the confirmation of  the sentence in respect of a reference made under  section 374 of the Code. According to Mr Huq, the  expressions “as he thinks fit” and “the judgment or  order shall follow such opinion” used in sections  378 and 429, are very significant. A close reading of  these expressions, Mr Huq argues, suggests that a  wide discretion has been given to the Third Ju  the legislature to decide in the facts of a given  when the opinion of the two Judges are placed                     before him whether or not he would hear the case in  respect of whom the Judges are not equally divided,  Mr Hug further argued that this being the exclusive  discretion of the Third Judge, if such Judge exercised his discretion judicially on consideration of  the materials on record, no exception could be taken  against such opinion, Mr Huq further argued that the  opinion of the Third Judge after hearing the case  either in respect of whom there is no difference of  opinion or in respect of whom there is difference of  opinion, and the judgment and order shall follow  such opinion. In this connection the leamed Counsel  has drawn our attention to the order dated 6th  February 2001 of the Third learned Judge and con-  tended that the Third learned Judge upon hearing the  Jeamed Counsels of both sides was of the opinion  that “the case of above 9 condemned prisoners over  whom the learned Judges not being divided in opin-  jon are not contemplated to be heard both under the  provision(s) of section (s) 378 and 429 of the Code  of Criminal Procedure. But only the case of accused  Abdul Mazed over whom there is difference as  regard the conviction under the two separate sec-  tions of the Penal Code and the cases of those five  other condemned prisoners over which the learned  Judges are equally divided in opinion......” MrHuq  contended that the Third learned Judge had rightly  exercised his discretion in not hearing the case in  respect of 9(nine) convicts in respect of whom the  learned Judges were not equally divided, rather con-  curred with their opinions as regards the conviction  and sentence of the nine convicts and none of the  accused took any exception against such opinion. In  support of his contention, the learned Counsel has  referred the cases of Babu vs State of UP AIR 1965  SC 1467, Tanviben Pankaj Kumar Divetia vs State  of Gujarat (1997)7 SCC 156, Sarat Candra Mitra vs  Emperor ILR 38 Cal 202, Ahmed Sher vs Emperor  AIR 1931 Lah 513, Subedar Singh vs Emperor AIR  1943 Allahabad 272, Nemai Mondal vs State of West  Bengal AIR 1966 Calcutta 194, State of UP vs Dan  Singh (1997) 3 SCC 747, Granade Venkata vs  Corporation of Calcutta 22 CWN 745, State vs Abul  Khair 44 DLR 284.    The learned Attorney-General and Mr Ajmalul  Hossain while endorsing the submissions of Mr Huq  added some points and also cited some decisions.  Learned Attorney-General contended that when a    Bench of two Judges agreed upon a decision, both of  them required to sign the judgment in respect of  them but when a Bench comprising of more Judges,  the decision of the majority would be the decision in  the case, and in such case it was not necessary to  sign the judgment by at least two of them for confirmation, Mr Ajmalul Hossain contends that there is fundamental difference in sections 378 and 429,  inasmuch as, while in section 378 the expressions “a  bench of Judges” have been used, in section 429 the  expressions “the Judges composing the Court of  Appeal” have been used. Again, in section 429 the  expression “of the same Court” have not been used  in the other section. According to the learned  Counsel, the object of sending a reference to the  High Court Division is that unless the sentence is  confirmed by two or more Judges, the sentence  could not be executed. Learned Counsel added that  a reference is required to be heard by at least two  Judges and the expression “bench of Judges” used in  section 378 means the sentence required to have  been, confirmed and signed by at least two Judges  for execution. In that view of the matter, the learned  Counsel concluded that a close reading of sections  374-378 would infer that the question of opinion of  the Third Judge arose when there was difference of  opinion of a Bench of Judges, and in a case where  there was no difference of opinion in respect of a  particular accused, the Third Judge was left with no  business to deal with his case and to give his opinion.    ",
      "531. It was contended on behalf of the Appel.  lant Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan that  there was no confirmation of sentence in the ¢Ye of  law since there was no consensus confirmation of    the sentence, Learned Counsel contended that the    “opinion of the learned Judges of the High Court,    Division were not judgments’ in accordance with  law since the confirmation of the sentence of the  accused persons were not made, passed and signed  by at least two Judges of the High Court Division, In  this contention, the learned Counsel drew our attention as to the meaning of “judgment” by referring Osborn’s Concise Law Dictionary, Aiyer’s Judicial Dictionary, Law Lexicon, Stroud’s Law Dictionary, and some decisions. Learned Counsel finally conended that in case of difference in opinion of the Judges of the Division Bench while confirming the sentence, the opinion of the Third Judge would pre-vail. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun endorsed the above  submissions. The learned Counsels have referred the  cases of Muhammad Shafi vs Crown 6 DLR (WP)  104 (FB), Abdur Razig vs State, 16 DLR (WP) 73,  Hethubha vs State of Gujarat AIR 1970 SC 1266,  Union of India and another vs BN Ananti  Padmanabiah, 1971 SCC (Cri) 535 (AIR 1971 SC  1836), Sajjan Singh vs State of MP 1999 SCC (Cri)  44 and Mahim Mondal vs State 15 DLR 615 in sup-  port of their contentions.    ",
      "530. Learned Counsels for the appellants  argued with circumlocution that since the learned  Judges of the Division Bench of the High Court  Division delivered dissenting judgments, the Third  leaned Judge ought to have heard the entire death  reference in respect of all the convicts but the  learned Judge heard the reference in respect of  6(six) convicts only, and thus the matter should be  remanded to the High Court Division for hearing of  the reference by the Third learned Judge afresh in  accordance with section of the Code of Criminal  Procedure (the Code). Mr Khan Saifur Rahman                   appearing for appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman and Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-  uddin Ahmed (Artillery) argued that there is no  judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court  Division in the eye of law since the leamed Judges  expressed their opinions separately and signed their  respective opinion in violation of section 377 of the  Code, Learned Counsel further argued that since the  confirmation of the sentence and the appeals pre-  ferred by the convicts were heard analogously, sec-  tions 378 and 429 of the Code are applicable in the  case, Which required that when the Judges are equal-  ly divided in opinion, the case with their opinions  thereon, shall be laid before the Third Judge, and  such Judge after such hearing shall deliver his opin-  ion and the judgment and order shall follow such  opinion.    Learned Counsel further argued that in view of  the difference of opinion, the learned Chief Justice  referred to the Third learned Judge to dispose of the  entire death reference by order dated 15th January  2001, but the Third learned Judge without compre-  hending the purport of the order and the law heard  the reference in piecemeal basis—the reference was  not finally disposed of in the eye of law. The learned  Counsel stressed that in no way the opinion of the  learned Judges of the Division Bench could be taken  as concurrent opinion in respect of the appellants  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieu-  tenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Maj  AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Major Bazlul Huda.  In this connection learned Counsel drew our atten-  tion to the confessional statements of Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and Maj AKM  Mohiuddin Ahmed and contended that their confes-  sional statements were disbelieved by the first  leaned Judge as not voluntary and though the sec-  ond leamed Judge believed them as voluntary, the  Third learned Judge did not consider their confes-  sional statements on the reasoning that he was not  hearing their case on merit and thus, it could be said  that on an important point they concurred their opin-  ions. According to the learned Counsel, if their confessional statements were not believed by one of the learned Judges of the Division Bench as voluntary,  then how their opinions would have been concurrent?    ",
      "529. This is an independent speaking order  and the appellants have not taken any exception  against the aforesaid order of the Third learned  Judge. The appellants on accepting the views taken  by the learned Judge pressed the appeals and the reference without challenging the said order before this Court. The Third learned Judge thereupon by judgment and order dated 30th April, 2001 maintained  the conviction and sentence in respect of three condemned prisoners including the appellant Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery) and accepted their death reference and finally disposed of the death reference, the operating portion of the judgment is as follows:  <br>  “In the result, the Death Reference No.30  of 1998 so far as it relates to Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel  Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Lieutenant  Colonel Abdur Rashid, Major Md Bazlul Huda,  Lieutenant Colonel Shariful Hug Dalim, BU,  Lieutenant Colonel AMRashed Chowdhury,  Lieutenant Colonel AKM Mohiuddin (Lancer),  Lieutenant Colonel) SHBM Nur Chowdhury,  Lieutenant Colonel Md Aziz Pasha, Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery),  Resalder Moslem Uddin @ Moslehuddin and  Capt. Abdul Mazed is accepted confirming the  Death Sentence and accordingly, Criminal  Appeal No.2616 filed by accused Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Criminal  Appeal No.2604 of 1998 filed by accused  Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid  Khan, Criminal Appeal No.2613 of 1998 filed  by accused Major Md Bazlul Huda and  Criminal Appeal No.2617 of 1998 filed by  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Antllery) are dismissed but Death Reference  No.30/98 so far as it relates to accused Capt.  Kismat Hashem, Major Ahmed Shariful  Hossain @ Shariful Islam and Captain Nazmul  Hossain Ansar is rejected and the conviction  and sentence of these accused are accordingly  set aside and thereby acquitting them of the  charges leveled against them in this case.”    ",
      "528. Before the Third learned Judge the  appellants filed applications for hearing of the death  reference in respect of all the condemned prisoners  for ends of justice. The Third learned Judge heard  the learned Counsels at length and by a reasoned  order dated 6th February, 2001 rejected the applica-  tion. The operating portion of the order is as fol-  lows:  <br>  “In view of the discussion above and  equally divided opinion of the learned Judges of  the Division Bench, I am of the opinion that the  cases of above 9 condemned prisoners over  whom the learned Judges not being divided in  opinion are not contemplated to be heard both  under the provisions of sections 378 and 429  CrPC. But only the case of accused Abdul  Majed over whom there is difference as regards  the conviction under the two separate sections  of the Penal Code and the cases of those 5 other  condemned prisoners over which the learned  Judges are equally divided in opinion i.e. convicted (sic) by one learned Judge and acquitted  by another learned Judge are before this Court  for an opinion. Upon delivery of the opinion by  this Court, the judgment and order shall follow  such opinion in order to dispose of the entire  death reference.”    ",
      "527. Opinion of the Third Judge.    In view of the difference of opinion as regards  conviction of 6 accused persons, the Division Bench  by order dated 14th December, 2000 passed the fol-  lowing order:    “Death Reference accepted in part, Crl A.  2604 of 1998, 2613 of 1998, and 2616 of 1998  are dismissed. Crl A 2617 of 1998 is allowed by  Mr Justice Md Ruhul Amin by judgment in sep-  arate sheets. Death Reference accepted in part,  CrL.A. 2604 of 1998, 2613 of 1998, 2616 of                  1998 and 2617 of 1998 are dismissed by Mr  Justice ABM Khairal Haque vide judgment in  separate sheets.” B.O.  <br>  “14-12-2000, As the judgment in Death  Reference No. 30 of 1998 is split one, let the  matter, as per provision of section 378 of the  Code of Criminal Procedure be placed before  the leamed Chief Justice for necessary orders.    Md Ruhul Amin  ABM Khairul Haque, JJ    ",
      "526. The prosecution sought to establish its  case against the accused persons by the evidence of  47 (forty-seven) witnesses out of 60 witnesses  examined, the confessional statements of Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel  Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery), the extra  judicial confession of Major Bazlul Huda, Lieu ten-  ant Colonel. Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Major  AKM Mohiuddin (Lancer), Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel  Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Major Shariful Haque  Dalim, Major Noor and Major Aziz Pasha proved by  Major (Retd) Shahadat Hossain Khan (PW 8) and  Commodore Golam Rabbani (PW 15), and the cir-  cumstantial evidence relating to the previous and  subsequent conducts of the appellants and other  accused persons. The accused persons including the  appellants asserted their innocence at the trial. The  confessional statements, according to them, were  not voluntarily made; the killing was result of a suc-  cessful revolt of the army against the then Govern-  ment.    ",
      "525. The matter was accordingly referred to a  Third leamed Judge Mr Mohammad Fazlul Karim, J  The Third learned Judge agreed with the Second  learned Judge as regards the conviction and sen.  tence of the appellant Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), Captain Abdul Majed and  Resalder Moslemuddin @ Mosleh Uddin. The Third  learned Judge also agreed with the first learned  Judge in respect of 3 (three) convicts. Prosecution  case has been exhaustively narrated by my learned  brother Mr Md Tafazzul Islam, J, so 1 do not con.  sider it necessary to repeat the same here. The  occurrence took place at dawn on 15th August, 1975  and over the said incident an FIR was lodged by  AFM Mohitul Islam (PW 1) with the Dhanmondi  Police Station on 2nd October, 1996.    ",
      "524. The appeals and confirmation proceed-  ings in the High Court Division were heard by a  Division Bench. The learned Judges concurred the  conviction and sentence in respect of 9 accused per-  sons including 4 appellants Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman,’ Lieutenant Colonel Sultan  Shahriar Rashid Khan, Major Md Bazlul Huda and  Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed. They differed in  their opinion regarding the conviction of 6 accused  including the appellant Lieutenant Colonel Mohi-  ddin Ahmed (artillery). The first learned Judge  acquitted Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed  (artillery), Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain @  Shariful Islam, Captain Md Kismat Hashem,  Captain Nazmul Hossain Ansar and Resalder  Moslemuddin @ Mosleh Uddin of the charges. In  respect of Captain Abdul Majed the first learned  Judge acquitted him of the charge under sections  302/34 of the Penal Code but maintained his conviction under section 120B of the Penal Code. The  Second learned Judge maintained the conviction and  sentence of all accused persons and accepted the  death reference.    ",
      "522. Having taken into consideration the facts  and circumstances of the case and upon detailed  analysis of the evidence and judgments of the  Courts below, I am of the view that there is no illegality in the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, and accordingly I concur with my  learned brother Md Tafazzul Islam, J in dismissing  all the appeals and affirming the Death Reference.    SK Sinha J: I have read the draft judgment pre-  pared by my learned brother Mr Md Tafazzul Islam,  J It is a judgment so well written I respectfully agree  with the conclusions reached by him in all the  appeals. Keeping in view, however, the points  involved in these matters which are indeed a great                   public importance and in view of the questions of  law raised at the Bar, I wish to give my own reasons.    20 (twenty) Army Officers and other ranks  including the 5 (five) appellants Major Md Bazlul  Huda, Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman,  Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahrior A. Rashid Khan,  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery)  and Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer) were  prosecuted for the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman, then President of the Republic,  his wife Begum Fazilat-un-nessa, sons Sheikh  Kamal, Sheikh Jamal, Sheikh Russell, sons’ wives  Sultana Kamal, Rozy Jamal, brother Sheikh Naser,  Security members ASI Siddiqur Rahman, army  sepoy Shamsul Huq and Colonel Jamil before the  learned Sessions Judge, Dhaka, The appellants and  10 others were convicted under sections 302/34 and  section 120B of the Penal Code. They were sen-  tenced to death under sections 302/34 of the Penal  Code but no separate sentence was awarded under  section 120B of the Penal Code.    ",
      "521. It is a pity that the surviving family  members of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  and the nation, as a whole, had to wait for about long  34 years to get justice by disposing of the criminal  case of the gruesome murder of the early morning of  1975. It has already been noticed that after the murder of Bangabandhu along with members of his  family and close relations in the early morning of  15th August, 1975 the Government of Khondker  Moshtaq Ahmed promulgated Indemnity Ordinance,  1975 and the subsequent Government took some  other steps to stop initiation of any criminal case in  respect of said gruesome murder of 15th August,  1975. Having gone through the evidence of the wit-  nesses and the materials on record we have been  shocked to notice that the then Government of  Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed and the subsequent  Governments, who were the beneficiary of the 1975  killings to the utter surprise and dismay of the nation  as a whole and the civilized society of the world  rewarded the murderers of the 15th August, 1975  being dismissed Army O1 and condemned convicts were illegally appointed in the Government  service and subsequently absorbed permanently in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for employment in  various Bangladesh missions abroad and thereby  undermining the constitutional process and fundamental human rights, conscience of the people and the ideals of the martyred freedom fighters who  have sacrificed their lives for the independence of  the country. It is unfortunate to note that some of  those accused persons according to the prosecution  were ‘self proclaimed killers’ and subsequently they  were also promoted to higher posts and some of  them were posted as diplomats in Bangladesh  Missions in various countries of the world. During  the course of his submission the learned Attorney  General in his choked voice has submitted before  the Court to make some observations so that this  kind of activities should not be repeated in future by  any Government of the country. In fact, all the  learned Counsels who appeared on behalf of the  respondent State in unison have prayed for such  observation before the Court. We totally disapprove  the aforesaid conduct, behaviour, mentalities and  activities of the Governments who were in power at  the relevant time and hope that this undesirable  activities which is shocking to the conscience of the  nation should not be repeated by any future  Government. We earnestly hope and believe that  tule of law, fundamental human rights, democratic  institution, overall the constitutional supremacy  should prevail in this country.    ",
      "520. Having gone through the materials on  records, 1 have found that the accused appellants  committed gruesome murder of the Father of  Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and  members of his family which included three women  and a minor child. Facts reveal that it is a pre meditated, well thought design to eliminate the entire  family of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and some of his very close  relations who are very dear to him whose contribution and sacrifice in the liberation movement and  war of liberation should be highly remembered.  Since the accused-appellants have committed a  heinous crime, they do not deserve any sympathy  from this Court in getting commutation of death  penalty.    ",
      "519. At the fag end of the submissions, the  learned Advocates of the accused appellants have  submitted that, without prejudice to their submis-  sions of their plea of not guilty, the sentence of death  penalty be commuted to rigorous imprisonment for  life considering the age, social status and family circumstances                   of the accused-appellants. In reply the  learned Attomey-General and the learned Advocate  for the respondent State, Mr Anisul Huq, have  Opposed the prayer stating that the accused appellants are guilty of heinous crime committed against humanity by killing the Father of the Nation,  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the then  President of the country along with members of his  family and relations and, as such, sentence of death  penalty should not be commuted.    ",
      "518. From the evidences of the aforesaid  prosecution witnesses, which have remained uncontroverted, it is abundantly clear that the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan in the Balurghat Parade Ground on the night following 14th August, 1975, presence in the Cantonment in movement of troops, his presence in the radio station, commanding the troops in the radio station, presence in Bangabhaban and his appointment in the Government service and subsequent absorption in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for employment in  various Bangladesh Missions abroad prove his  involvement in the commission of the offences  under sections 302,34 and 120B of the Penal Code.  In particular, the evidences prove Lieutenant  Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan’s presence  within the proximity of the place of occurrence.  Moreover, the evidences prove that Lieutenant  Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan in furtherance  of the common intention performed his assignment  at the designated places including Balurghat Parade  Ground on the night following 14th August, 1975  and thus this proves his participation in the commis-  sion of the offence under sections 302, 34 and 120B  of the Penal Code.    ",

Then  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and  Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid ordered  them to take ammunition from the unit.

      "510. We have already discussed the sum and  substance of the evidence of aforesaid witnesses.  But about the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Sultan  Shahriar Rashid Khan I like to discuss in brief. PW  43 stated in his deposition about the commission of  the offence at Road No.32, Dhanmondi. He stated  that there was conference in the house of Khondker  Moshtaq Ahmed with Lieutenant Colonel Khondker  Abdur Rashid Khan, Lieutenant Colonel Faruque  Ahmed, Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid and  some other army officers in June/July, 1975. PW 14  stated that after the night parade on the night fol-  lowing 14th August he saw in the parade ground  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman intro-  duced Major Dalim and Lieutenant Colonel  Shahriar in civil dress.

      "508. It appears from the aforesaid evidences  that the defence failed to challenge the statements of  PWs during cross-examination vis-a-vis the involve:  ment of Major AKM Mohiuddin (Lancer) in the  offence and as such the evidence of witnesses  remained uncontroverted and hence the prosecution  proved the guilt of the accused-appellant under sec-  tions 302, 34 and 120B of the Penal Code beyond  reasonable doubt.    ",
      "507. PW 60, Director General, Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, Government of Bangladesh pro-  duced a file containing a letter dated 16th August,  1976 (Exhibit-10/5A) issued by the Army Head-  quarters about the services of the Army Officers  including Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer)  and 11 other accused persons who were placed on  deputation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for  employment in various Bangladesh Missions  abroad.

",
      "505. PW 13 also attended the parade ground  in the night following 14th August, 1975 at 8-30 PM  and the parade was finally made over by Major  Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer).

When  he went in front of the gate of the house of  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and after  some time he saw Lieutenant Colonel Faruque  Rahman went away with the tank.    ",
      "465. Since my learned brother Md Tafazzul  Islam, J in his judgment has elaborately referred to  the evidence of witnesses in respect of the arrival,  presence and participation of the accused-appellants  in the commission of the offence under sections 302,  34 and also 120B of the Penal Court, I shall be brief  in discussing relevant evidences.    Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, PW  44 was the commander of 46 Brigade. He deposed  that accused Appellant Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman was the 2 IC of First Bengal  Lancer. Syed Faruque Rahman did not fight for War  of Liberation and did not get seniority of two years  and for that he had grievance against Bangabandhu  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. According to him,  Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman was the broth-  er-in-law of Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur  Rashid.    PW 43 stated in his deposition that Lieutenant  Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid, Lieutenant  Colonel Faruque Rahman and Lieutenant Colonel  Shahriar Rashid and some other officers were pres-  ent in a secret meeting after the function at                  Daudkandi Madrasha.    ",
      "464. Whether Charge of Murder has been  Proved on the Basis of Proper Evaluation and  Sifting of Evidence on Record :  <br>  Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, Abdur Razaque Khan  and Abdullah Al Mamun, the learned Advocates  appellants in all the appeals have submitted in unison that the charge of murder against convict appellants under sections 302 and 34 of the Penal Code on the basis of proper evaluation and the on record and thereby a appearing for the at as not been pro Advocate and Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attomey General appearing for the respondent hi submitted in identical terms that both the trial Court  and the High Court Division made concurrent find-  ings of facts as to the complicity of the accused-  appellants in the commission of the offence. The  learned Attorney-General having referred to the evi-  dence of witnesses has submitted that the eye- wit-  nesses deposed that they had seen the presence of  Major Bazlul Huda, Major Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Lancer) and Syed Faruque Rahman at the house of  the President Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur  Rahman at Road No.32, Dhanmondi in committing  murder as stated above.    ",
      "463. From the foregoing discussions and findings of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, I am of the view that learned Judges of the High Court Division rightly found that conspiracy was started in  March,1975 at Lieutenant Colonel Rashid’s house at  cantonment, nurtured in different meetings between  Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed and the accused Army  Officers at BARD, Comilla and in Moshtaque’s  house at Daudkandi, Dhaka Aga Masi Lane, Ramna  Park, Shahriar Rashid’s residence at Cantonment  and Balurghat Parade Ground. Since all the accused  persons participated in the conspiracy and some of  them started in March,1975, some of them subsequently participated from March-August, 1975 and all of them were present in the Balurghat parade  ground and having been fully apprised and motivated  by Syed Faruque Rahman and Shariful Huq Dalim,  and as such, the accused persons including the  accused appellants participated in the assassination of the then President and the killing of members of his family and, as such, all of them are guilty for crimi-  nal conspiracy under section 120B of the Penal Code.  So relying on the case laws discussed above and the  materials on record, it can be safely held that there  was sufficient legal evidence on record that the  accused-appellants along with other accused persons  committed criminal conspiracy to murder the then  President Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and  the members of his family. There was no case of  criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny which has  been rightly proved by the evidence of the witnesses.    ",
      "462. On careful scrutiny of the evidence of the  aforesaid prosecution witnesses, it appears that they  proved the prosecution case in corroborating case  other as to the allegation of conspiracy to commit  murder of the then President Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman and the members of his family and  thereby proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.    ",
      "461. From the aforesaid evidence of the wit-  nesses it appears that there was conspiracy for mur-  der of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with  members of his family being hatched by the accused  persons to achieve their mission in furtherance of  the common intention of all the accused persons  This evidence of witnesses described the discus-  sions amongst the accused-appellants with the other  accused persons and thereafter briefing the troops  by accused Syed Faruque Rahman, Khondker Abdur  Rashid and Shariful Huq Dalim. While doing the  conspiracy as per briefing of Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman troops under the command  of both Lancer and Artillery Units including some  dismissed officers went to the Tejgaon Airport Road,  some of them to the house, of Abdur Rob  Shemiabat, Sheikh Fazlul Hoque Moni, some of  them at the Radio Station, Shahbagh and some went  to resist BDR and Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddia  Ahmed (Artillery) was sent with cannon to  Kalabagan Lake Side, Dhanmondi and to House  No.677, Road No. 32. Major Bazlul Huds.  Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer), SHMB Nur                   Chowdhury and Md A, Aziz Pasha went to the residence of the then President. This scenario shows that deployment of troops in different places as stated above were deployed in furtherance of their premed itated plan to kill the then President with members of his family and relations also to resist any other force.    ",
      "460. PW 1 deposed that in the early morning of  Sth August, 1975 he saw Lieutenant Colone|  Faruque Rahman was asking something to Major  Bazlul Huda at the gate of the residence of  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Road  No,32, Dhanmondi and in reply he said “all are fin.  ished”, PW 1 saw Licutenant Colonel Faruque  Rahman, Major Dalim, Major Nur, Major Bazlul  Huda in the residence of the then President at Road  No.32, Dhanmondi at the time of the occurrence and  thereafter.    ",
      "459. PW 44 deposed that on hearing the news  of the death of the then President, he rushed to Is  Bengal Regiment and found one tank in offensive  position with Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman  who fired from the tank on the lined-up trucks of  supply and transport company with his heavy  machine gun.

At the time  of his duty at Bangabhaban, he used to see Lieu-ten-  ant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Licutenant  Kismat Hashem, Lieutenant Nazmul Hossain Ansar  and Resalder Moslemuddin visiting Banga Bhaban  by jeep.

On a further query from  him as to whether Shafiullah Shaheb knew about it,  Lieutenant Colonel Faruque replied that he did not  think it necessary.

      "454. PW 24 was a Sepoy in 2nd Field  Artillery Regiment. They had night training pro-  gramme on 14th August. They were taken to the  New Airport at about 10-00/10-30 PM and during  the night parade at about 3-00/3-30 AM Lieutenant  Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid arrived there and  directed them to go to another place for an urgent  duty and thereafter they were taken to Lancer Unit,  where Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman  briefed them in presence of their CO, Lieutenant  Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid and other officers.  Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid and  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque introduced them  with the dismissed officers, namely, Major Dalim,  Major Rashid Chowdhury, Lieutenant Colonel  Shahriar and Captain Majed. Then Lieutenant  Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid and Lieutenant  Colonel Shariful Huq Dalim addressed them by stat-  ing that the Government had failed to protect the  honour of the womenfolk and the people are dying  of hunger, as such, the Government has to be over-  thrown. Thereafter Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman and Lieutenant Colonel Khondker  Abdur Rashid ordered them to take ammunition  from the unit. When they started from the Lancer  unit and stopped on a road, PW 24 also saw  Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar, Captain Majed and  Captain Mostafa. He also saw Major Dalim, Major  Nur, Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar, Lieutenant  Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid, Major Rashed  Chowdhury, Captain Majed, Captain Mostafa and  other officers going inside the Radio Station.    ",
      "453. PW 23 deposed that they had night  parade on the night following 14th August, 1975. He  also made identical statements like PW 17 and PW  18, On being ordered the troops of B Squadron fell  in and Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman  said that there was tank exercise and the tanks  would go outside. Out of 12 tanks, six were found fit  and six tanks were started with force and ammunition. At about 3-00/3-30 AM, Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman again returned there, and be  again left and there after returned at about 4-00  AM with Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain al  Shariful Islam and Captain Nazmul Hossain Anser.  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman had  boarded a tank placed in the front of the line,  Captain Md Kismat Hashem had boarded the next  one and Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain alias  Shariful Islam and others had boarded the rest. O\"  the order of Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque                    Rahman, the tank fleet started to move. The evi-  dence of this prosecution witness shows that  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman had  organised his Lancer Regiment and commenced his  operation with immaculate precision without discle  ing his real intentions to the tank crew and the ordi-  nary sepoys. Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman in a very successful manner in getting the  and deployed in the city in the pretext of  tank exercise. According to the prosecution witness-  es, those tanks were deployed at designated places in  order to facilitate the killing of the then President and  also stop any resistance by any other force or person.    ",
      "452. PW 14 was in 1st Bengal Lancer Regiment. He made identical statements like PW 12 and PW 13. He also attended the parade ground in the night following 14th August 1975. After the night parade he saw in the parade ground Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Major Mohiuddin (Lancer), Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain, Lieutenant Kismat Hashem, Nazmul Hossain Ansar and some other persons in civil dress, Accused Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman introduced Major Dalim, Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar in civil dress. Accused Lieutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman directed them to obey their orders. In the Radio Station he saw that Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid Khan was coming from the radio station after 5-30 O'clock in the morning. PW 14 proved the presence of the accused Lieutenant Cole  Shahriar Rashid in the parade ground in the cantonment near Balurghat at 2-30 O'clock in the morning and at about 5-30 AM in the Radio Station, PW 24 also in his deposition stated that Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid went to the parade ground at about 3-00/3-15 AM on the night following on 14th August, 1975 where Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman briefed them in presence of their  CO, Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid  and other officers. Lieutenant Colonel Khondke;  Abdur Rashid and Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  introduced them with the dismissed officers, namely, Major Dalim, Major Rashid Chowdhury,  Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar and Captain Majed,  Then Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and  Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid ordered  them to take ammunitions from the unit. When they  started from the Lancer unit and stopped on a road  PW 24 also saw Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar,  Captain Majed and Captain Mostafa, He also saw  Major Dalim, Major Nur, Lieutenant Colonel  Shahriar, Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur  Rashid, Major Rashed Chowdhury, Captain Majed,  Captain Mostafa and other officers went inside the  Radio Station.    PW 17 and PW 18 also made identical statements.    ",
      "451.   PW 13 was in 1st Bengal Lancer. He made identical statements like PW 12, He also  attended in the parade ground in the night following  14th August, 1975 at 8-30 PM In the mid-night he  saw Lieutenant Colonel Khondker Abdur Rashid  going with Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman. But some time later Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman returned to the unit. PW 13  as per order of Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman accompanied by Resalder Moslemuddin,  Dafadar Marfat Ali and LD Abdul Hashem Mridha  in a truck went to the house of Sheikh Fazlul Huq  Moni and from there they went to the Road No.32,  Dhanmondi. He also heard gun shots from the house  of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Some  time later Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman came out of Road No.32, Dhanmondi in the  tank followed by the Resalder Moslemuddin alias  Moslehuddin and others. He saw Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and Lieutenant  Kismat Hashem inside the tank, PW 13 heard gun  shots from the house of Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman but he did not go to that house. He  proved the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman who was in full command in front  of house of the then President at Road No.32,  Dhanmondi. This evidence of PW 13 was corroborated by PW 1 in material particulars stating that he had seen tank passing in front of the house of  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. PW 13 was  also corroborated by the confessional statement of  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery).    ",
      "450. PW 12 was in Ist Bengal Lancer whose  Commanding Officer was Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman. As the substantive CO Major  Momin was on leave Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman was in-charge CO of the  Regiment. They assembled in the parade ground at 9  PM on the night following 14th August, 1975. In the  parade ground, Licutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman, Major Mohiuddin, Major Shamsuzzaman,  Captain Delwar Hossain, Lieutenant Kismat  Hashem, Lieutenant Nazmul Hossain Ansar,  Resalder Major Syed Ahmed, Resalder Moslemuddin, Resalder Mobarak, RDM Mosaddek Arshed  MDM Naeb, Resalder Malek, Naeb Resalder  Islam, Dafader Jabbar (PW 14), Dafader Haider  Lance Dafadar Lutfor Rahman, ALD Moslemuddin  ALD Mohsin and others were present. The parade  continued till 12-00 midnight. with a break of 20  minutes. The classes continued till 3-30 in the morning, again they fell in there. At that time Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Major Mohiuddin (Lancer), Major Ahmed Shariful Hossain,  Lieutenant Kismat Hashem, Lieutenant Nazmul  Hossain and the JCOs were discussing about something in the corner of the parade ground. PW 12 saw three unknown officers who were introduced by  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman as Major  Dalim and Captain Huda, but he could not remember the name of the other officer. Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman while briefing the troops  stated that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was going to  declare monarchy in the meeting to be held at the  University on 15th August but they should not support monarchy and, as such, they must obey command of him and that of his officers. PW 12 saw that accused Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman was instigating his troops and flaring them up without disclosing his actual intentions but inciting them to accomplish his own mission. PW 12 and other troops from its Bengal Lancer and 2nd Field  Artillery Regiment started from Balurghat to the  then President's residence at Road No.32,  Dhanmondi, At that time PW 12 saw Lieutenant  Colonel Faruque Rahman in the t PW 12 proved  that Faruque took part in conspiracy by inciting,  arming and deploying the troops on the night fol-  lowing 14th August, 1975 and in the early hours of  15th August, 1975 and also his presence at Road  No.32, Dhanmondi in front of the residence of the  then President.      ",
      "449. The evidence of the following witnesses  supports the prosecution case. PW 11 was in Ist Bengal Lancer whose commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Momin and his 2nd-in-command was Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and his squadron commander was Major AKM Mohiuddin (Lancer). There was a night parade in the night following 14th August, 1975.<br>  Though he has not participated in the night parade  but on the direction of his SDM he went in front of  his store as the parade fell in there. PW 11 saw  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Resal-  der Muslehuddin, Major Mohiuddin, Major Ahmed  Shariful Hossain, Lieutenant Kismat Hashem,  Lieutenant Nazmul Hossain Ansar, Resalder Sarwar,  Major Nurul Hug, LD Abul Hashem Mridha,  Dafadar Marfat Ali and other NCOs and JCOs. By  the order of his SDM he went to “Kote” (light  armoury) at about 3-30 AM and took one G-3 rifle  with 18 rounds cartridge and a magazine. Then at 4-  30 in the morning he went to the residence of the  then President at Road No.32, Dhanmondi. Some  time later, a tank came and PW 1] saw Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman and thereafter he  also saw Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer),  Lieutenant Colonel SHMB Nur Chowdhury and  Major Bazlul Huda, Resalder Sarwar, Subedar  Major and few others together went in front of the  gate of the residence of Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman,    ",
      "448. From the careful scrutiny of the evidence  of witnesses in the instant case, we will be dealing  with the involvement of the accused-appellants in  the conspiracy for the killing of Bangabandhu  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and members of his family, As stated above, the accused-appellants are  liable, amongst others, under section 120B of the  Penal Code for conspiracy. Here, it would be deter-  mined whether such conspiracy was for killing  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his fam-  ily members or for committing mutiny to change the  then Mujib Government. It is well established by the  apex Court of our country as well as the Supreme  Court of India that the evidence of conspiracy is  never palpable nor it is crystal clear rather criminal  conspiracy is always hatched in secrecy. It is always  impossible to get direct evidence for criminal conspiracy                   But however in the instant case the learned  Advocate for the respondent-State and the learned  Attorney-General has referred to the evidence of  PW 43 who deposed that in March,1975 Khondker  Moshtaq had attended a conference at BARD,  Comilla. After the conference Lieutenant Colonel  Khondker Abdur Ras relation of Khondker  Moshtag, accompanied by another army officer had  secret meeting in the rest house with Khondker  Moshtaque along with Mahbubul Alam Chashi,  Taheruddin Thakur where they had hatched conspiracy.  ",
      "447. Conspiracy for Murder or Conspiracy for  Committing Mutiny—The fourth ground on which  leave was granted concerned the question as to  whether it is case of criminal conspiracy for murder  or a case of conspiracy for committing mutiny. [p,  the instant case the convict appellants and other  accused persons were convicted under sections 302,  34 and 120B of the Penal Code. It has been asserted  on behalf of the accused-appellants that the evidence on record does not disclose the case of criminal conspiracy to commit murder of Bangabandhy  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and members of his family, but rather it disclosed a case of criminal conspiracy to commit mutiny to change the then Mujib Government. Confronted with such a situation, we  have already discussed above the provisions of sections 302 and 120B of the Penal Code. A criminal  conspiracy has been defined in section 120A of the  Penal Code. In order to constitute criminal conspiracy there must be an agreement of two or more per-  sons to do an illegal act or to do an act by illegal  means in furtherance of their common design,  Section 120B of the Code provides for punishment  of criminal conspiracy. So whenever a person is  found to be a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death or rigorous  imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards or  where no express provision is made in the Code for  the punishment of such conspiracy he will be punished in the same manner as if he had abeted such offence.    ",
      "446. We find that before pronouncement of  his judgment, the learned Sessions Judge vide his  orders dated 24-3-1997 and 2-4-1997 gave notice to  the concerned Army authority, and in reply the  Army Headquarter as per provisions of Criminal  Procedural Rules (Military Offenders), 1958 vide  Office Memo dated 2-4-1997 informed that there is  no bar in trying retired army personnel in the criminal Court and thereby complied with section 94 of  the Army Act. In view of the aforesaid discussions  and findings, I am of the view that since the  accused-appellants were not on active service with in the meaning of section 8(1) of the Army Act,  1952 the accused persons cannot be tried under the  Army Act and, as such, there was no offence of  mutiny leading to murder in the facts of the instant  case. Moreover, even if one were to accept for sake  of argument that offences committed were civil  offences within the meaning of section 8(2) read  with section 59(2) of the Army Act, there is no legal  bar in trying those accused persons in the Sessions  Court in compliance with the provisions of section  94 of the Army Act read with section 549 of the  CrPC. In that view of the matter, there is no legal bar  for trial of the accused appellants in the Criminal  Court in the relevant case, inasmuch as the offences  committed are in the nature of murder simpliciter.    ",
      "445. We have found that the second and Third  learned Judges made concurrent findings on this                    point holding that there is no illegality in holding  trial before the Court of Sessions. The forum of trial  is governed by procedural law and it is well established that the procedure followed by a civil Court is much fairer and transparent than the procedure followed in Court Martial. In that view of the matter, there is no question of prejudice caused to the convict appellant. In this end in the case of Jamil Hug vs Bangladesh reported in 34 DLR (AD) 125 at page 138, paragraph 37 the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court has quoted with approval of the  observations of Prof, Holland published in Law of  Court Martial (Current Legal Problem 1950 at page  193) which reads as follows:<br>    “I would accordingly, suggest that the juris-  diction of Court Martial should be statutorily  confined to the offences against discipline and all  the jurisdiction over civil offences should be  taken away except where it is reasonable and  impracticable to arrange for a civil trial.”    ",
      "444. On careful examination of the evidence  adduced by PW 8, PW 9 and PW 45, it appears that  they support the prosecution contention that the evidences do not disclose that the murders were committed in the course of mutiny. Both the first learned Judge and Third learned Judge in their judgment came to the conclusion that there was no case of mutiny leading to murder. No charge was framed rightly before the learned Sessions Judge. We also find substance in the submission of the learned  Attorney-General that the statement submitted by  the accused appellant Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan  Shahriar Rashid Khan and Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Artillery) at the time of giving statement under section 342 of the CrPC did not mention that the murders on the 15th August, 1975 were committed in  course of mutiny.    ",
      "443. In the case of Haider Ali Khan vs State  reported in 1994 BLD (AD) 270 = 47 DLR (AD) 47,  the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court he  that the jurisdiction of the Court below  challenged in appeal at a belated stage. The same  principle has also been enunciated in the case of  Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto vs State reported in PLD 1979  SC 53, The learned Attorney-General has also point-  ed out that on behalf of the accused Syed Faruque  Rahman, the sitting of the Court at Nazim Uddin  Road was challenged by filing Writ Petition  No.2032 of 1997 which went up to the Appellate  Division reported in 49 DLR (AD) 157 and on behalf  of the accused Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and  Syed Faruque Rahman, the vires of the Indemnity  Repeal Act,1997 was also challenged in the High  Court Division, which went up to the Appellate  Division reported in 3 BLC (AD) 89 but the accused  appellants never challenged the jurisdiction of the  Court on the ground that the murder was committed  in course of mutiny and the normal criminal Court  has no jurisdiction to try the offence.    ",
      "442. The prosecution in the instant case  examined 61 witnesses but none of them was cross examined on behalf of the defence in respect of  killing in the course of mutiny. From the record it  ‘appears that no such plea was at the trial Court  by the defence at a belated stage while in the High  Court Division at the time of hearing of the death  reference and the respective appeals.    ",
      "441. In the case of Balbir Singh vs Punjab  reported in 1995 1 SCC 90 where the accused per-  sons were on the active service of the Air Force at  the time of commission of offence, but  Commanding Officer did not exercise his discretion  to decide before which Court the proceeding should  have been instituted. The accused persons were convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge under sections 302 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The  Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and observed  that the option to try a person subject to Air Force  Act who commits an offence while on active service  is in the first instance with the Air Force Authorities  and, as such, the accused has no option or right to  claim trial by a particular forum.    ",
      "440. In this case Mr Anisul Huq has referred  to the case of Joginder Singh vs Himachal Pradesh  reported in AJR 197] SC 500. Where the accused  being a Lance Naik in the Indian Army was charged  with rape of a ten years old girl, He was convicted  under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and not  by Court Martial. It was contended before the  Supreme Court that before trial of the Court, section  549 of the CrPC has not been complied with. The  Supreme Court dismissed the appeal holding that in  the absence of exercising discretion by the designated officer as to the forum of trial, the Army Act would not obviously be in the way of the criminal  Court exercising its ordinary jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of law.    ",
      "439. In the instant case, it appears that the  learned Sessions Judge before proceeding with the  case has complied with the provisions of law by  issuing orders as stated above and the prescribed  officer in the instant case did not exercise his discretion to hold the trial before a Court-Martial.    ",
      "438. On perusal of the Order No.1 dated 24-  3-1997, it appears that the learned Sessions Judge  sent a notice to the Chief of Staff Army under Rule  2 of CrPC Rule (Military Offenders),1958 in respect                    of the trial in the Sessions Court, It also transpires  from the Order No,12 dated 3-4-1997 passed by the  learned Sessions Judge that there was memo sent by  the Judge Advocate, General Division, Dhaka  Cantonment dated 2-4-1997 under Memo  No. JAG not that there was no bar in  holding trial of retired Army Officers under the  Amy Act in the Sessions Court    ",
      "437. Furthermore, sections 94 and 95 of the  Army Act, 1952 provides for the concurrent juris.  diction to the Court Martial and ordinary criminal  Court. section 94 envisages that in respect of a civil  offence, when a Court Martial and a criminal Court  have concurrent jurisdiction, the prescribed officer  of the Army has discretion to decide before which  Court the proceeding shall be instituted and if he  decides that the case shall be instituted before a  Court-Martial, it shall direct that the accused per-  sons be detained in military custody. However, in a  case under section 95 of the Army Act, when a criminal Court having jurisdiction is of the opinion that proceedings ought to be instituted before itself in respect of any civil offence, it may by written notice  require the prescribed officer to produce the offend-  er to nearest Magistrate or to postpone proceedings  pending a reference to the Government. Section 549  of the CrPC provides the procedures to be complied  with regarding a person liable to be tried by a Court  Martial by delivering them to the military authority.    ",
      "436. Suffice it to say, none of the accused per.  sons were on ‘active service’ as defined under section 8(1) of the Army Act. Accordingly, the accused  persons cannot be tried under the Army Act in view  of sub-section (2) of section 59, inasmuch as the  three alternative conditions enumerated therein have  not been satisfied.    ",
      "435. This means that a case of murder cannot  be tried under the Army Act if the victims are not  subject to the Army Act, unless the perpetrator,  were persons subject to Army Act and on ‘active  service’ while committing the offence. Section 8(1)  of Army Act defines ‘active service’ as the time duping which such person is attached to a force engaged  in operation against an enemy or military operation,  or is on line of march to a place occupied by ay  enemy, or is part of a force engaged in military operation against a foreign country.    ",
      "434. The offence of murder has been defined  in section 300 of the Penal Code. When an offence  of mutiny is committed it is exclusively triable by  Court Martial. The offence of murder is not defined  under Chapter 5 of the Army Act. According to section 3(2) of the Army Act, ‘civil offence’ means an  offence committed in Bangladesh triable by a criminal Court. Criminal Court has been defined under  section 8 (7) of the Act as a Court of ordinary criminal justice in Bangladesh or established elsewhere  by the authority of the Government. Section 59 of  the Army Act deals with the civil offences. Sub-section (1) of section 59 of the Act provides that any  person subject to this Act who commits any civil  offence shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence  under this Act, and on conviction to be punished in  accordance with provisions of this Act. But sub-section (2) of section 59 provides that a person subject to this Act who commits an offence of murder  against a person not subject to this Act shall not be  dealt with under this Act unless he commits any of  the following offences:  <br>  (a) while on active service or <br>  (b) at any place outside Bangladesh, or <br>  (c) at frontier post. <br>    ",
      "433. In reply to the submissions of the learned  Advocates for the accused-appellants, Mr Anisul  Hug, learned Advocate appearing for the respondent-State, has submitted that the statement in the  leave granting order whether it is mutiny leading to  murder or murder simpliciter is misconceived  because from the thorough scrutiny of the evidence  of the prosecution witnesses and the materials on  record, a case of murder has been made out, There  was no case of mutiny leading to murder and, as  such, the offences of mutiny and murder are two dis-  tinct offences. The offence of mutiny has not been  defined in the Army Act, 1952, However, Chapter 5                    of the Army Act, 1952 provides for offences under  the Army Act and punishments for mutiny and  insubordination. Punishment for mutiny and insubordination has been provided in section 31 of the Amy Act, 1952. It appears that section 35 of the  Navy Ordinance, 1961 defines Mutiny which reads  as under:  <br>  5. In this Ordinance, mutiny means a  combination between two or more persons sub-  ject to service law, or between persons two at  least of whom are subject to service law—  <br>  (a) to overthrow or resist lawful authority  in the armed forces of Bangladesh or any forces  co-operating therewith or in any part of any of  the said forces;  <br>  (b) to disobey such authority in such circumstances as to make the disobedience subversive of discipline, or with the object of avoiding any duty or service, or in connection with operations against the enemy; or  <br>  (c) to impede the performance of any duty  or service in the armed forces of Bangladesh or  in any forces co-operating therewith, or in any  part of any of the said forces.”    ",
      "432. Mutiny Leading to Murder or Murder  Simpliciter The Third ground on which leave was  granted relates to as to whether the case concerns  mutiny leading to murder or murder simpliciter.    ",
      "431. Delay in lodging FIR—On the second  ground of delay in lodging the First Information  Report (FIR), my learned brother Md Tafazzul  Islam, J in his judgment has extensively discussed  the facts, relevant laws, grounds of delay in lodging  the FIR including the background and the scenario  which then prevailed in Bangladesh after the assassination of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, along with members of his family and relations in the early hours of 15th August, 1975. My learned brother in his judgment has considered the respective opinions of the learned Judges of the High Court Division and  found that the learned Judges have given cogent reasons in believing the explanation of delay given by  the prosecution. Accordingly, my learned brother  has found that the delay in lodging FIR has been sufficiently explained. In that view of the matter, I fully  agree with my learned brother.    ",
      "430. The Third learned Judge is completely  free to resolve the matter as he thinks fit in his full  discretion. According to section 429 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure the Third Judge is free to decide  on what point he shall hear argument. The expression “if any” postulates that the Third Judge is free  in resolving the difference between the two Judges  of the Division Bench. From a careful scrutiny of  the case law of the Sub-continent, mostly from the  decisions of the Supreme Court of India, the considered view is that it is for the Third Judge to decide on what points he shall hear the arguments whether he will hear the whole matter or only the part where difference in opinion lies between the two Judges it the Division Bench. From the provisions of section’ 378 and 429 of the CrPC, the expression “judgment! or order shall follow such opinion” postulates that it is the decision of the Third Judge which is the judgment                  of the Court, in other words, the judgment of  the Court is based upon opinion of the Third Judge,  In the instant case we have seen that the Third  learned Judge Mohammad Fazlul Karim, J initially  heard an application separately filed on behalf of  some of the accused - appellants for hearing all the  appeals in respect of all the accused persons upon  whom there was a difference of opinion between the  Judges of the Division Bench, It has already been  noticed that the Third learned Judge after hearing  the application on this particular issue passed a separate order dated 6-2-2001 holding the case of 9  condemned prisoners over whom the learned Judges  of Division Bench were not divided in opinion are  not contemplated to be heard both under the provision of sections 378 and 429 of CrPC, and accordingly Third learned Judge decided to take up the hearing of six accused persons in respect of whom there was difference in opinions between the two Judges of the Division Bench. Having considered all  aspects of the case, the Third learned Judge upheld  the conviction confirming the death references so  far as it relates to Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid  Khan, Lieutenant Colonel Khandker Abdur Rashid,  Major Md Bazlul Huda, Lieutenant Colonel Shariful  Hoque Dalim, BU Lieutenant Colonel AKM Rashed  Chowdhury, Major AKM Mohiuddin (Lancer),  Lieutenant Colonel SHBM Nur Chowdhury, Lieu-  tenant Colonel Md Aziz Pasha, Lieutenant Colonel  Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery), Resalder Moslemuddin @ Moslehuddin and Captain Abdul Majed  and accordingly dismissed the Criminal Appeal  No.2616 of 1998 filed by accused Lieutenant  Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman, Criminal Appeal  No.2604 of 1998 filed by accused Lieutenant  Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Criminal  Appeal No.2613 of 1998 filed by accused Major Md  Bazlul Huda and Criminal Appeal No.2617 of 1998  filed by Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Artillery) were dismissed but rejected the Death  Reference No.30 of 1998 so far as it relates to  accused Captain Md Kismat Hashem, Major Ahmed  Shariful Hossain @ Shariful Islam and Captain  Nazimul Hossain Ansar, So it appears that the Third  learned Judge after proper compliance with the  Provisions of sections 378 and 429 of the CrPC has  decided the points on which he had to hear the arguments and in that matter the Third learned Judge was completely free in resolving the difference as he  thinks fit. So we do not find any illegality in the  judgment and order passed by the Third learned  Judge. Having gone through the record we also find  that the Third learned Judge delivered the judgment  in accordance with sections 378 and 429 of the  CrPC So we do not find any merit in the contention  of the accused appellants in this regard.    ",
      "429. From the careful scrutiny of the case  laws of the Sub-continent including the decisions of  our Apex Court it appears that when the Judges of  the Division Bench of the Court of Appeal are  equally divided in their opinion and the matter is  laid before the Third learned Judge, the case with  their opinions are laid before the Third Judge of the  same Court as per provisions of section 378 and 429  of the CrPC. Such Judge after such hearing as he  thinks fit shall deliver his opinion and the judgment  or order shall follow such opinion. The expression  “after such hearing (if any) as he thinks fit” envisages that it is completely the discretion of the Third  learned Judge as to how he will hear the case.    ",
      "428. In the case of Abdur Raziq vs State  reported in 16 DLR (WP) 73, where it has been held  that the plain reading of sections 378 and 429 of the  Code of Criminal Procedure shows that the Third  learned Judge to whom the case is referred need not  agree with the finding of either of the two Judges,  He is to give an independent opinion and then give  his finding.    ",
      "427. In the case of Mohammed Shafi vs  Crown reported in 6 DLR (WP) 104, there was difference of opinion in respect of single accused per-  son between two learned Judges of the High Court  and the matter was laid before the Third learned  Judge under section 429 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure. It has been held that the Third learned  Judge before whom the case is laid under section  429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure exercises the  authority of a Bench of three Judges and therefore,  he should be considered not as a single Judge, but tig  a Bench, The case is not dealt with by a Single  Judge, but one which is dealt with by three Judges,  even though the Third Judge is dealing with it at a  later stage than the two disagreeing Judges.    ",
      "426. In the case of Granade Venkata vs Corporation of Calcutta reported in 22 CWN 745.  Where Supreme Court of India held that in a case  referred under section 429, CrPC, a Third Judge  would not differ upon a point on which both the  referring Judges were agreed unless there were  strong grounds for doing so.    ",
      "425. In the case of State of UP vs Dan Singh  reported in (1997) 3 SCC 747, there was difference  of opinion against some of the accused persons.  Kirpal, J observed—    “What is clearly evident is that the appeal  is finally disposed of by the judgment and order  which follows the opinions of the Third Judge.  This being so special leave petition could only  have been filed after the appeal was disposed of  by the High Court vide its final order dated 19-  5-1998. Even though the said order purports to  relate only to ten out of thirty-two accuseds the  said order has to be read along with the earlier  order of 15-4-1987 and, in law, the effect would  be that the order dated 19-5-1998 will be  regarded as the final order whereby the appeal  of the State was partly allowed, with only two  of the thirty-two accused being convicted under  section 325 read with section 34, IPC, while all  the other accuseds were acquitted.”    ",
      "424. The Supreme Court further held—    “The present was not a case wherein the  entire matter relating to the acquittal or conviction of Bhagat Ram had been left open because  of a difference of opinion between the two  Judges. Had that been the position, the whole  case relating to Bhagat Ram could legitimately  be considered by Jagat Narayan, J and he could  have formed his own view of the matter regarding the correctness of the order of acquittal made by the trial Judge in respect of Bhagat Ram. On the contrary, as mentioned earlier, an express order had been made by the Division Bench upholding the acquittal of Bhagat Ram for offences under sections 120B, 218, 347 and 389, IPC and the State appeal in that respect had been dismissed. The above decision of the                  Division Bench was binding upon Jagat  Narayan, J and he was in error in convicting  Bhagat Ram for offences under section 120B,  218 and 347, IPC despite the order of the  Division Bench. It was, in our opinion, not  within the competence of the learned Judge to  reopen the matter and pass the above order of  conviction in the face of the earlier order of the  Division Bench.”    ",
      "423. In the case of Bhagat Ram vs State of  Rajasthan reported in AIR 1972 SC 1502, there was  difference of opinion in respect of only one accused  person. The matter was laid before the Third Judge  under section 429 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure. The Supreme Court of India held—  <br>  “In view of the fact that the State appeal  against the acquittal of Bhagat Ram for  offences under sections 120B, 218, 347 and  389, IPC had been dismissed by the Division  Bench, it was, in our opinion, not permissible  for the Third Judge to reopen the matter and  convict Bhagat Ram for offences under sections  347, 389 and 120B IPC. The matter had been  referred under section 429 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure to Jagat Narayan, J because  there was a difference of opinion between  Tyagi, J and Lodha, J regarding the correctness  of the acquittal of Bhagat Ram for offences  under section 161, IPC and section 5(1) (a) of  Prevention of Corruption Act. Jagat Narayan, J  could go only into this aspect of the matter and  arrive at his conclusion.”    ",
      "422. In the case of Nemai Mondal vs State of  West Bengal reported in AJR 1966 Calcutta 194, the  two Judges differed in respect of some of the  accused persons and accordingly a Third Judge was  referred under section 429 of the Code. Mukharji, J  observed—  <br>  “What is laid before the Third Judge is “the  case” itself and not merely the points of difference or the views of difference. The case with the differing opinion is placed before the Third Judge. In other words, it is the duty of the Third Judge to decide “the case” and not merely the points on which the Judges differed. No doubt in doing so, the two differing opinions have to be considered by the Third Judge...........<br>  At the same time, the word “case” normally  would mean in the case of a number of appellants,  the case of each appellant considered separately. In  other words, if out of three, two Judges of the  Division Bench agree on one and disagree in respect  of the other two appellants, then the “case” that is  referred to under section 429 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure is the case not of the appellants  on which they agree but the appellants on whom  they had disagreed. The case in such a context  means the case in respect of the appellants on which  the two Judges are equally divided. The words  “equally divided” in section 429 of the Criminals  Procedure Code seem to support that construction.”    ",
      "421. In the case of Ahmed Sher vs Emperor  reported in AJR 1931 Lah 513. In this case there is  difference in opinions against some of the accused  persons. There are in total 41 accused persons. First  Judge convicted 9 accuseds under sections 325, 149  and 147 of the Indian Penal Code and acquitted the  others. Both the two Judges acquitted all the accused  persons, On a suo motu appeal under section 302 the  case was laid before the Third Judge under section  429 of the CrPC It has been held that the Third  learned Judge has to look only as to the case of those  accused with regard to whom the two Judges had  differed. As regard the case of accused with regards  to whom the Judges had differed the Third Judge  could look at all the points not just point of difference.    ",
      "420. In the case of Sarat Chandra Mitra vs    Emperor reported in JLR 38 Cal 202, where the  High Court Division of India observed—    “Two points are worthy of note in connection with this section: first, that what is laid before another Judge is the “case” and, secondly, what the judgment or order follows is the opinion delivered by such Judge. I am not now concerned with the question of the trial of two prisoners with regard to one of whom the  Judges composing the Court of Appeal may be  agreed in their opinion, while as regards the  other the Judges may be equally divided in  opinion. In such a contingency it is quite possible to maintain the view that, upon a reasonable  interpretation of the term “case” what has to be  laid before another Judge is the case of the prisoner as to whom the Judges are equally divided  in opinion. I am now concerned only with the  contingency in which the Judges of the Court of  Appeal are equally divided in opinion upon the  question of guilt of one accused person, though  upon certain aspects of the case they may be  agreed in their view. In such a contingency,  what is laid before another Judge, is not the  point or points upon which the Judges are  equally divided in opinion, but the “case”. This  obviously means that, so far as the particular  accused is concerned, the whole case is laid  before the Third Judge, and it is his duty to con-  sider all the points involved, before he delivers  his opinion upon the case. The judgment or  order follows such opinion which need not necessarily be the opinion of the majority of the three Judges; for instance, at the original hearing of the appeal, one Judge may consider the prisoner not guilty, another Judge may consider him guilty under one section of the Indian Penal                  Code, and liable to be punished in a certain  way: the Third Judge may find him guilty under  a different section and pass such sentence as he  It is this last opinion which prevails, subject to the provisions of section 377 of the Criminal Procedure Code  in the case of  confirmation of sentences of death.”    ",
      "419. In the case of Mattar vs State of UP  (2002) 6 SCC 460 where there was difference in  respect of only one accused person. The Supreme  Court of India observed—    “The Judges in different dissenting opinions have given detailed reasons, for and against the acceptance of the version as deposed  by these eyewitnesses. The Third learned  Judge, under these circumstances, was required  to independently examine the matter and  express his opinion. It is not permissible to only  or merely indicate the agreement with one or  the other view without giving reasons therefor.”      ",
      "418. While commenting on the scope and jurisdiction of the Third learned Judge the Supreme  Court of India in the case of Sajjan Singh vs State of  MP reported in (1999) 1 SCC 315 observed as follows:    “It is the Third Judge whose opinion matters; against the judgment that follows there from that an appeal lies to this Court by way of special leave petition under Article 136 of the Constitution or under Article 134 of the Constitution or under section 379 of the Code. The Third Judge is, therefore, required to examine whole of the case independently and it can-  not be said that he is bound by that part of the  two opinions of the two Judges comprising the  Division Bench where there is to difference. As  a matter of fact the Third Judge is not bound by  any such opinion of the Division Bench. He  will not hear the matter as he is sitting in a  three-Judge Bench where the opinion of majority would prevail.”    ",
      "417. In the case of Tanviben Pankajkumar  Divetia vs State of Gujrat reported in (1997) SCC 7  156 = AIR (1997) SC 2193 the observation of  Supreme Court of India on identical provisions of  section 429 (own law) reads as under:    “The plain reading of section 392 clearly  indicates that it is for the Third Judge to decide  on what points he shall hear arguments, if any,  and it necessarily postulates that the Third  Judge is free to decide the appeal by resolving  the difference in the manner he thinks proper.”  Citing the case of Babu vs State of UP reported  in AIR 1966 SC 1467 it has been held that                    where the Third Judge did not consider it necessary to decide a particular point on which  there had been difference of opinion between  the two Judges, but simply indicated that if at  all it was necessary for him to come to a decision on the point, he agreed with all that had  been said about by one of the two Judges, such  decision was in conformity with law. That the  Third Judge is free to decide the appeal in the  manner he thinks fit has been reiterated in  Hethubha vs State of Gujrat reported in AIR  1948 All 237 and Union of India vs BN Anantha  Padma Nabiah reported in AIR 1971 SC 1836.  In State of Andhra Pradesh vs PT Appaiah  reported in AJR 1981 SC 265 it has been held by  this Court that even in a case when both the  Judges had held that the accused was guilty but  there was difference of opinion as to the nature  of offence committed by the accused, it was  open to the Third Judge to decide the appeal by  holding that the accused was not guilty by considering the case on merit.”    ",
      "416. In the case of State of Andhra Pradesh vs  PT Appaiah reported in AJR 198] SC 265, the  Judges of the High Court Division differed in opinion regarding all the accused persons. The Supreme  Court of India held that the Third Judge is competent to deal with the whole case and he is not bound  to confine his judgment only to the matter concerning difference of opinion between the other two Judges.    ",
      "415. In the case of Union of India vs BN  Anantha Padma Nabiah reported in AIR 197] SC  1836, there was difference of opinion with regard to  all the accused persons. Supreme Court of India held  that the Third learned Judge could deal with the  whole case. The language of section 429 of the  CrPC is explicit that the case with the opinion of the  Judges comprising the Court of Appeal shall be laid  before another Judge of the same Court. The other  noticeable feature in section 429 of the CrPC is that  the “judgment or order shall follow the opinion” of  the Third learned Judge.    ",
      "414. In the case of Hethubha vs State of  Gujrat reported in AIR 1970 SC 1266, there was difference of opinion between the two Judges of the  High Court Division and accordingly the matter was  laid to the Third learned Judge under section 429 of  the CrPC In this decision, Ray, J observed as  under—    “Counsel for the appellants contended first  that the Third learned Judge under section 429  of the Criminal Procedure Code could only deal  with the differences between the two learned  Judges and not with the whole case. The same  contention had been advanced before Mehta J,  in the High Court who rightly held that under  section 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code the  whole case was to be dealt with by him. The  Court in Babu vs State of Uttar Pradesh )1965)  2 SCR 771 = (AIR 1965 SC 1467) held that it  was for the Third learned Judge to decide on  what points the arguments would be heard and  therefore he was free to resolve the difference  as he thought fit. Mehta J, here dealt with the  whole case. Section 429 of the Criminal  Procedure Code states “that when the Judges    comprising the Court of Appeal are equally  divided in opinion, the case with their opinion  thereon shall be laid before another Judge of the  same Court and such Judge, after such hearing,  if any, as he thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion,  and the judgment and order shall follow such  opinion”, Two things are noticeable: first, that  the case shall be laid before another Judge, and,  secondly, the judgment and order will follow  the opinion of the Third learned Judge. It is,  therefore, manifest that the Third learned Judge  can or will deal with the whole case.”    ",
      "413. In respect of the decisions of the Indian  Courts, we may refer to the case of Dharam Singh  vs State of UP reported in 1964 (1) CriLJ 78, where  it was held that in a trial of 12 accuseds, trial Court  convicted 10 accused persons under sections 302, 34  and 149 of the Indian Penal Code and acquitted two .  accused persons. The State preferred appeal against  the acquittal and 10 convicts preferred appeal  against the conviction. The learned Judges of the  Division Bench equally differed in their opinion.  Consequently, the matter was laid before the Third  learned Judge. The Third learned Judge concurring  with one of the Judges upholding the acquittal of  one of the appellants and set aside the acquittal of  one accused. The Supreme Court of India examined  the scope of section 429 CrPC in the following  words:    “All that section 429 says is opinion of the  two Judges who disagree shall be laid before  another Judge who, after giving such hearing, if  any, as he thinks fit, shall deliver his opinion                  and the judgment or order should be in accordance with such opinion, Now it is obvious that  when the opinions of the two Judges are placed  before a Third Judge he would consider those  two opinions and give his own opinion and the  judgment has to follow the opinion of the Third  Judge. Consequently on that opinion is based  the judgment of the Court. For all practical purposes the Third Judge must consider the opinions of his two colleagues and then give his own opinion but to equate the requirements with appeals against acquittals is not justified by provisions of section 429 or by principle or precedent.”    In the case of Babu vs State of UP reported in  AIR 1965 SC 1467, where there was difference of  opinion between the two Judges of the High Court,  the matter was laid before the Third Judge. Supreme  Court of India held that section 429 of the CrPC  contemplates that it is for the Third Judge to decide  on what points he shall hear arguments, if any, and  that postulates that he is completely free in resolving  the difference as he thinks fit.    ",
      "412. So far as the concerned accused in  respect of whom there was difference of opinion the  whole case shall be laid before the Third learned  Judge who is duty bound to consider all the points  involved before he delivers his opinion upon the  case. In the case of State vs Abul Khair reported in  44 DLR 284, where two Judges of the Division  Bench were equally divided on the validity of conviction and sentence of two appellants, but they  agreed with regard to the conviction of one accused  i.e, Abul Khair. The case was laid before the Third  learned Judge under sections 378 and 429 of the  CrPC. The Third learned Judge dealt with the case  of two accused persons with regard to whom the  learned Judges of the Division Bench had differed.    ",
      "411. Murshed, J further observed as follows.    “Under the provisions of section 429  Criminal Procedure Code upon the difference  of opinion between the Judges the case has to  be laid before a Third Judge, and this necessarily means that the whole case has to be referred  to the Third Judge and not merely the point of  points on which the Judges differ. The judgment  or order shall follow the opinion given by the  Third Judge.”    ",
      "410. Thereafter the Third learned Judge was  pleased to dispose of the Death Reference and the  connected appeals as per provisions of sections 378  and 429 of the CrPC It has transpired that the decisions of Supreme Court of the Sub-continent have not laid down a clear guideline as to how the Third learned Judge should deal with the cases where  there is a difference of opinion between the Judges  of the Division Bench. From a long series of cases,  it has come to our notice that the Supreme Court of  the Sub-continent has categorised the cases into two  broad groups. Firstly, where there is difference of  opinion in respect of all the accuseds i.e. where first  learned Judge acquitted all accuseds and the second  learned Judge convicted all, and secondly, when  there is difference of opinion either on evidence or  points of law leading to conviction under different  provisions of law or acquittal of some of the accused  persons. In this context, the position of this Apex  Court is not very clear. However, in the case of  Mohim Mondal vs State reported in 15 DLR 615,  where six accused persons were convicted under  sections 304 and 148 and other provisions of the  Penal Code, the learned companion Judge of the  Division Bench of the then Dhaka High Court differed only with regards to the conviction of accused  Mohim Mondal under section 148 of the Penal  Code. The case was laid before the Third learned  Judge under sections 378 and 429 of the CrPC. The  Third learned Judge, Murshed, J, as he then was  observed as under:    “Although my learned brothers have both  concurred in affirming the conviction of appellant Mahim Mondal under section 304 of the  Pakistan Penal Code as well as the sentence  pronounced upon him thereunder, the entire  case with regards to this appellant also is now  before me, inasmuch as there has been a dis-  agreement with regard to his conviction under  section 148 of the Penal Code.”    ",
      "409. In the instant case, the learned Sessions  Judge, Dhaka convicted 15 accused persons including the present 5 appellants under sections 120B,  302 and 34 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to  death. It appears that the learned Sessions Judge  though convicted the accuseds under section 120B  of the Penal Code, yet he did not pass any separate  sentence thereunder. As against the said judgment  and order of Sessions Judge, the accused-appellants  preferred separate appeals before a Division Bench  of the High Court Division. The first learned Judge  of Division Bench found the present appellants and  four others guilty for the offence charged against  them and upheld the conviction and sentence under  sections 302, 34 and 120B of the Penal Code, and  the judgment and order of Sessions Judge was there-  by affirmed in respect of those nine accused condemned convicts. The Death Reference so far as it  relates to the convict Captain Abdul Majed was confirmed by the learned presiding Judge with modification of conviction and sentence from sections 302, 34 and 120B of the Penal Code into section 120B of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death and his conviction and sentence under sections 302 and 34 was set aside. But the Death Reference so far as it  relates to the remaining six condemned convicts was  rejected including Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Artillery) and, accordingly, Criminal  Appeal No.2617 of 198 was allowed by the learned  presiding Judge of the Division Bench. However,  the second learned Judge of the Division Bench  upheld convictions of all the fifteen accused convicts. In view of this division of opinions of the two  learned Judges of the Division Bench, the case with  their opinions thereon was laid before Md Fazlul  Karim, J the learned Third Judge of the High Court  Division under sections 378 and 429 of the CrPC  and such Judge after hearing as he thought fit delivered his opinion, and the judgment and order followed such opinion. We have already noticed that on the application of Major Huda, Lieutenant Colonel  Faruque and Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid the  Third learned Judge after hearing the parties as he  thought fit by judgment and order dated 6-2-2001  observed as under:    “In view of the discussion above and  equally divided opinion of the learned Judges of  the Division Bench, I am of the opinion that the  cases of above 9 condemned prisoners over  whom the learned Judges not being divided in  opinion are not contemplated to be heard both  under the provision of section 378 and 429 of  the Code of Criminal Procedure. But only the  case of accused Abdul Mazed over whom there  is difference as regard the conviction under the  two separate sections of Penal Code and the  cases of those five other condemned prisoners  over which the learned Judges are equally                  divided in opinion i.e. convicted by one learned  Judge and acquitted by another learned Judge,  are before this Court for an opinion, Upon  delivery of the opinion by this Court, the judgment and order shall follow such opinion in order to dispose of the entire death reference.”    ",
      "408. Scope and Jurisdiction of the Third  Learned Judge.        In these appeals leave was granted on five  grounds, The first ground relates to scope and juris-  diction of the Third learned Judge.    ",
      "407. In respect of Lieutenant Colonel Sultan  Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lieutenant Colonel  Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery), they have submitted  that they have also took active part in furtherance of  common intention to kill Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman and members of his family, and  referring to the eye-witnesses, they submitted that  the eye-witnesses have witnessed them at designat-  ed places. They finally submitted that all the  accused appellants committed a conspiracy to kill                   Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and members of his family and ultimately killed them, It is  not a conspiracy to commit mutiny, and to that end  the learned Attorney-General and Mr Anisul Huq  have submitted that the accused-appellants first  assembled at Balurghat parade ground and proceeded towards their assigned places. They further submitted that from the evidence of witnesses previous conducts of the accused-appellants were relevant in finding their participation in the conspiracy and these accused-appellants moved to their designated places in furtherance of the common intention to commit murder and their subsequent acts after the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and members of his family. Their presence at the Radio Station and at Bangabhaban also proved their participation in the conspiracy and the premeditated killing of the then President and members of his family. They submitted that there was no violation of section 377 of the CrPC As per sections 378 and 429 of the CrPC, since the Judges of the Division Bench were equally divided in their opinions, the case with their opinions thereon were laid before the Third learned Judge of the same Court who after such hearing delivered his opinion whereupon the judgment or order followed such opinion. In the light of the scrutiny of evidence and discussion, I am of the view that there is no illegality in the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, which has been passed in accordance with law. As such, all the appeals are liable to be dismissed and the Death Reference is liable to be affirmed.    ",
      "406. Mr Anisul Hug, the learned Special Prosecutor for the respondent State, and Mr Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney-General, have submitted in  unison that the learned Sessions Judge of the trial  Court and the Hon'ble three Judges of the High  Court Division gave concurrent findings on Proper.  assessment of evidence on record; that the ACs  appellants have committed offence under Sections  302 ,34 and 120B of the Penal Code. They have sub.  mitted that on careful scrutiny of the evidence Of the  witnesses it appears that out of the convict appey,  lants, Major Bazlul Huda, Major AKM Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Lancer) and Lieutenant Colonel Syeq  Faruque Rahman, went to the place of occurrence  House No.677, Road No.32, Dhanmondi and referring  to the relevant evidence of the eye-witnesses he  has asserted that Major Bazlul Huda shot at Sheikh  Kamal, Sheikh Naser and Bangabandhu Sheik  Mujibur Rahman, a Police Officer, placed on as  security guard of the residence of the President,  They. have contended that Major AKM Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Lancer) also participated in the commission  of the offence by making some gun shots towards  the lake, shooting towards .Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman and killing some of the inmates,  They have also referred to the evidence of witness-  es and showed that Lieutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman took a leading role and conspired  in the killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur  Rahman along with his family members and close  relations. and, as such, he managed the entire  episodes and events that took place from Balurghat  to New Airport, then at Cantonment area along with  various places and thereafter at House No.677, Road  No.32, Dhanmondi, Radio Station, near race course  and after the occurrence at Bangabhaban and there  by Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman  played the principal role in the conspiracy and  killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  and 11 other persons of his family and two officials  at the residence Road No.32, Dhanmondi. All of  them committed the criminal act in furtherance of  common intention.    ",
      "405. Mr Abdullah-al-Mamun, appearing on  behalf of the accused appellant Major Bazlul Huda  and Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer), has  made identical submissions like Mr Saifur Rahman  Khan and Mr Abdur Razaque Khan. He has further  submitted that the alleged confessional statement  made by Major Bazlul Huda is not true and volun-  tary since the same was obtained after pro-longed  remand in police custody and he also stated that  since the first Judge of the Division Bench discard-  ed the confessional statement not being true and vol-  untary, the second learned Judge should not have  taken it into consideration. He has submitted both  the learned Judges of the Division Bench discarded  section 10 and, as such, confessional statement  alleging conspiracy by the accused appellant could  not be proved since section 10 of the Evidence Act  was not made applicable in a case where conspiracy  has gone beyond the stage of conspiracy and the  substantive offence has been committed in pur-  suance of conspiracy as in the instant case after  commission of the murder.    ",
      "404. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan also has sub-  mitted that PW 57 Investigating Officer made  Seizure List as Exhibit 9 relating to service record of  Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan  who stated that he was attached to the then President  Secretariat from 15-8-1975 till he joined the Foreign  Service and that he had been formerly absorbed in  the Foreign Ministry and that he had been promoted  to Lieutenant Colonel on 29-11-1977 and as such he  has no role in the alleged occurrence since he was  not physically present and none of the witnesses  stated his complicity in the commission of offence  and as such his conviction and sentence is liable to  be set aside.    ",
      "403. Mr Abdur Razaque Khan, the learned  Advocate appearing for the accused appellant  Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid KI  has submitted that the High Court Division del  ered two separate parallel judgments and two indi-  vidual judgments and the same is not the judgment  in the eye of law. He then submitted that the First  Information Report having been lodged after 21  years after the date of occurrence, there was embel-  lishment in the facts of the case, He then submitted                    that the accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel Sultan  Shahriar Rashid Khan was not present at the place  courrence, Trial Court as well as the High Court  on misconceived the evidence on record and  convicted the accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel  Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan.    ",
      "402. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman, Mr Abdur  Razaque and Mr Al-Mamun, the learned Counsels  for accused-appellants, have submitted in unison  that charge of murder against convict appellants  under section 302 read with section 34 of the Penal  Code has not been proved on the basis of proper  evaluation and sifting of evidence on record and, as  such, miscarriage of justice has occurred. Mr Saifur  Rahman Khan has submitted that the confessional  statement of accused appellant Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman and Lieutenant Colonel  Shahriar Rashid Khan were not true and voluntary.  Since those statements were recorded under duress  after prolonged remand in police custody which has  been rightly found by the learned first Judge of the  Division Bench and, accordingly he has disbelieved  the alleged confessional statement made by them.  The leamed Advocate has submitted that the second  learned Judge of the Division Bench without proper  consideration of the material evidence on record  wrongly found that the confessional statements were  true and voluntarily and, accordingly, accepted  those statements as legal piece of evidence against  the so-called confessing accuseds and the other co-accuseds in the case. Mr Khan Saifur Rahman has  also submitted that there was no conspiracy com-  mitted by the accused appellants. The learned  Advocates have submitted that the alleged confes-  sional statements were not true and voluntary and,  as such, these should not be taken into considera-  tion.    ",
      "401. PW 6 stated that he was posted in One  Field Artillery at Comilla.

Thereafter, Major Bazlul Huda,  Lieutenant Colonel SHMB Nur Chowdhury and  Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) came  down and went outside the gate to the road towards  south of the house. Thereafter Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman (Lancer) came back and got  down from the tank. He talked with Major Bazlul  Huda and other officers.

",
      "397. PW 12 in his deposition stated that there  was night parade on the night following 14th August  which was attended by them till 3-30 AM. He saw  three unknown officers in uniform who were intro-  duced by Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman  (Lancer) as Lieutenant Colonel Shariful Hug Dalim  and Major Bazlul Huda. Licutenant Colonel Syed  Faruque Rahman briefed them that they should not  support monarchy but Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was  going to declare monarchy next day and as such  troops must obey his orders as well as the orders of  his officers and further directed them to take ammu-  nition from the “Kote” for the action. PW 1 AFM  Mohitul Islam, the informant of the case, was the  Personal Assistant of the then President of  Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  and was on duty in his residence at House No.677,  Road No.32, Dhanmondi from 8-00 PM on 14th  August, 1975. He spent his night there. At about 4-  30 -5-00 AM on 15th August, 1975, the President  told him to get in touch with the Police Control  Room (PCR). As he could not get in touch with PCR  properly, the President came down to PW1’s Room.  Suddenly a barrage of gun shots was fired on their  windows. When the firing stopped, the President on  his own valiantly enquired about the firing from the  army and police sentries present nearby.  Immediately thereafter, Sheikh Kamal came down.  At that time 3/4 Khaki and Black-dressed army per-  sonnel entered into the house and Major Bazlul  Huda fired a bullet at Sheikh Kamal and he fell  down in the room. The bullets also wounded the  informant PW 1 and PW 50 (DSA) who was in  charge of Police House Guard. They could not  escape as they were caught hold by Major Bazlul  Huda who put them in line in front of the main gate  of the house. The Special Branch Officer, standing  on the line, was shot down. Thereafter some of the  accused went upstairs shooting through the way.  The informant and PW.50 heard intermittent gun-  shot sounds and the cries of the women from  upstairs. Sheikh Naser, brother of Bangabandhu  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was brought down from  upstairs, and was shot in the bathroom attached to  their office. Sheikh Russell, the youngest son of the  President and domestic servant Rama alias Abdur  Rahman were also brought down. When Sheikh                     Russell wanted to meet with his mother, the accused  persons snatched him away from the informant on  the pretext of taking him to his mother on the first  floor and thereafter the PW I again heard sound of  gunshot. At that time Major Bazlul Huda, who was.  at the gate told Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman (Lancer) that “all are finished”, Then PW 1  realised that the President of Bangladesh, Banga-  bandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, along with the  members of his family and other inmates of the  house were all brutally killed. At that time tanks  were moving on the road in front of the house of the  then President at Road No.32, Dhanmondi.  Lieutenant Colonel Jamil’s dead body was brought  in the house at about 8-00 AM. According to the evi-  dence of witnesses it appears that in the early morn-  ing of 15th August, 1975, the Father of the Nation,  President Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,  Begum Mujib, Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Naser and one  Police Officer of the Special Branch and others were  all brutally killed. PW 1 saw the presence of Lieu-  tenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman (Lancer),  Lieutenant Colonel Shariful Hug Dalim, Lieutenant  Colonel SHMB Nur Chowdhury and Major Bazlul  Huda in the house of the then President at the time  of occurrence and also after the occurrence. It tran-  spires from PW 1’s evidence that he made his  acquaintance of Major Bazlul Huda in 1973 in the  ferry ghat at Aricha Ghat.    ",
      "396. PW 11 stated that at the time of night  parade the army officers went to the office of Major  AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) which was locat-  ed opposite to the quarters of PW 11 where he saw  some unknown army officers in civil dress, and at  about 12-00 midnight, he saw Major AKM Mohi-  uddin Ahmed (Lancer) calling one person in civil  dress as “Huda come here”. Then Huda asked an-  other one “Dalim wait”. Thereafter PW 11 as SDM  asked him to go’ the “Kote” (i.e. light armoury)  straightaway for arms. Accordingly, he went to the  “Kote” at about 3-30 AM and took one G-3 rifle  with 18 cartridges and a magazine. The troops were  divided into several groups. Major AKM Mohiuddin  Ahmed (Lancer) briefed his group and asked them  to board the vehicle, PW 11 saw the said two per-  sons were previously in civil dress but thereafter in  amy uniform, one of them was a Major and the  other one was a Captain. He came to know from  Resalder Sarwar that they were Lieutenant Colonel  SHMB Nur Chowdhury and Major Bazlul Huda.  PW 1] with the vehicle came at about 4-30 AM near  the house of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  Which was about 80 feet away from the house. He  heard reports of fierce gun shots from the side of the  house of the then President and immediately there-  after he heard the words ‘hands up’, ‘hands up’. He  also heard the sound of 3/4 artillery gun shots. PW  1] was posted outside the gate of the house of  Bangabandhu with orders not to allow any entry or  exit into/from the house and where he saw that  Major AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer),  Lieutenant Colonel SHMB Nur Chowdhury and  Major Bazlul Huda were entering into the house of  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Road  No.32, Dhanmondi.    ",
      "395. In order to prove the charge against the  appellant, Major Bazlul Huda, the prosecution  examined a number of witnesses, namely, PW 1,  PW4, PW 5, PW 6, PW 7, PW 8, PW 9, PW 11, PW  12, PW 15, PW 21, PW 22, PW 46, PW 47 and PW  60 in support of their case.    ",
      "394. PW 35 also stated in his deposition that  Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery)  was commander of 2nd Field Artillery Regiment. He                     heard from PW 18 that Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) took most of his troops to Dhanmondi. From the aforesaid evidence it appears that the PWs corroborated each other in proving the guilt of Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed(Artillery).    ",
      "393. PW 21 stated that on 15th August, 1975  they had the night parade on 14th August, 1975 at 9-  00 in the evening.

      "392. PW 17 saw Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) in the night parade on the  night following on 14th August, 1975 and afternoon  in the Regiment Parade Ground and in the evening  at Balurghat. From the evidence of PW 17, it transpires that Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed  (Artillery) with Lieutenant Colonel Khondker  Abdur Rashid and others and thereafter on the order  of Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery), six guns were mobilised and deployed by the  side of the lake of Kalabagan and four rounds of  cannon shells were fired from the Kalabagan lake  side.

",
      "391.

      "389. Now it has to be analysed evidentially  whether the accused appellants have committed  offence under section 302 read with section 34 of  the Penal Code, From the evidence of Prosecution  witnesses namely, PW 44, PW 43, PW 11, PW 12,  pw 13 and PW 14, it appears that the accused  Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman was in  charge of the operation and he was mobilising his  force according to his plans for Killing the then  president Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  and members of his family at House No, 677, Road  No.32, Dhanmondi. From the evidence of PW 20,  PW 23, PW 24, PW 25, PW 35, PW 39, PW 40, PW  44, PW 1, PW 4, PW 15, PW 16, PW 42, PW 44,  PW 45 and PW 46 it is manifested that the presence  of Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque Rahman in the  residence of the then President at 32, Dhanmondi,  Radio Station and Balur Ghat in briefing the troops  and also mobilised them are all connected and the  same were done in furtherance of his common inten-  tion to materialise the ultimate goal of killing  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. PW 43 stat-  ed in his deposition about the conspiracy in the  house of Khondker Moshtaq Ahmed with Major  Khondker Abdur Rashid, Lieutenant Colonel  Faruque Rahman, Lieutenant Colonel Shahriar  Rashid and some other army officers in July, 1975  after the meeting in a Madrassa at Daudkandi and  also at BARD, Comilla in 1975.

Accused Lieutenant Colonel  Syed Faruque Rahman introduced Major Dalim and  ‘eutenant Colonel Shahriar in civil dress. Accused  ‘eutenant Colonel Faruque Rahman directed them  to obey their order. In the radio station, he saw  “leutenant Colonel Shahriar Rashid coming from  ‘he radio station after 5-30 AM in the morning. PW  14 proved the presence of the accused Lieutenant  Colonel Shahriar Rashid in the parade ground in the  ‘Cantonment near Balurghat at 2-30 AM in the morning and at about 5-30 AM in the Radio Station, PW 24 also in his deposition stated that Major Khondker Abdur Rashid went to the parade ground at about 3-00/3-15 AM on the night following on 14th August,  1975 where Lieutenant Colonel Syed Faruque  Rahman briefed them in presence of their Com:  manding Officer (“CO”), Major Khondker Abdur  Rashid and other officers.

In Banga Bhaban he also saw  Major Shafiullah, Lieutenant Colonel Faruque  Rahman and Major Mohiuddin Ahmed (Lancer) in  the afternoon of 15th August, 1975.    ",
      "388. In extraordinary and exceptional circum-  stances of the instant case, I am of the opinion that  physical presence at the place of occurrence at  House No.677, Road No.32 is not necessary, where  all the accused-appellants in furtherance of their  common intention performed their respective crimi-  nal acts at designated places which were assigned to  them by the other accused persons as evident from  the evidence of prosecution witnesses. The require-  ment of physical presence in a given case depends  on its facts and circumstances. Fact of the instant  case is that the victims of murder includes  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Father  of the Nation, who was also the President of the  Republic with members of his family and others at  the relevant time. I agree with the submissions of Mr  Tawfiq Nawaz, learned Senior Advocate and State  Counsel in the instant appeals, that constitutional  and legal personality, status, functions, privilege and  immunities as enjoyed by the President of the  Republic under the Constitution of the People’s  Republic of Bangladesh should be borne in mind in  treating the instant case as an extraordinary or  exceptional case. Any harm done to the President of  the Republic amounts to an offence and violation of    the Constitution and resulting in irreparable damage  to the democratic institutions of the country. The  facts of the instant appeals involve an exceptional  circumstance, inasmuch as it relates to the   unsavoury acts of the accused-appellants killing the  Father of the Nation and President of the Republic,  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, with members  of his family and relations. In view of the constitutional privileges, special security measures and safeguards rendered to the President, the ambit of the net of conspiracy pre-plan and illegal Support  required for the heinous killing of the President cap.  not be equated with that of an ordinary citizen resid.  ing in a dwelling hut or any other place. To materi.  alise the common objective of the killing of  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with the  members of his family the accused appellants par.  ticipated in their respective assignment covering a  greater range of area starting from Cantonment,  Parade Ground of Balurghat, New Airport,  Mohakhali, area of Manik Mia Avenue, Mirpur  Road, Ministers’ Residence, Shahbagh Radio  Station, corner of Race Course, Lake Side at  Kalabagan, Dhanmondi and finally to House  No.677, Road No.32, Dhanmondi, and that provi-  sions of section 34 of Penal Code contains rule of  evidence which does not create a substantive  offence and, as such, the said participations of the  accused-appellants were made in furtherance of  their common intention to do the illegal act of the  killing of the then President with members of his  family and relations comes within the purview of  section 34. In accordance with the pre-plan pr  design and in order to materialise the same, the  accused appellants were deployed for committing  the illegal act of killing the then President with  members of his family and relations and according”  ly I am of the view that the convictions 4 coe  accused-appellants under sections 302, 34 and 120B  of the Penal Code do not suffer from any illegality  and, as such, the same do not call for any interfer  ence by this Apex Court. Since the trial Court in  the High Court Division made concurrent in  as to the commission of the offence, there is no  scope at this stage to interfere with the cone  findings of facts as to the involvement of the  accused-appellants in the commission of off  and, as such, all the appeals are liable to be dismissed                  and the Death Reference is liable to be  affirmed.    ",
      "387. Both the learned Attorney-General and  Mr Anisul Huq having referred to the evidence of  PW 1, PW 4, PW 11, PW 12, PW 14, PW 37, PW  42, PW 48, PW 50, PW 20, PW 45, PW 47, PW 48  and PW 49 submitted that all the accused-appellants  with their common intention and common design  did their respective assigned tasks at designated  places and thereby participated in the commission of  offence causing the killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh  Mujibur Rahman and other victims on 15th August,  1975. In the reply, they have submitted that the prin-  ciple of section 34 of the Penal Code is very much  applicable in the case of all accused-appellants,  including the accused appellants, Lieutenant  Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) and  Lieutenant Colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan,  who had not gone to the House No.677 of the then  President at Road No.32, Dhanmondi.    ",
      "386. In the circumstances, it is well estab-  lished that for section 34 of the Penal Code to apply,  while the presence of accused is essential, but it  need not necessarily be the physical presence in all  cases. For the purpose of section 34 of the Penal  Code, “presence” of a person depends on the indi-  vidual facts and circumstances of a case. An  accused’s presence could be established if he has  joined in the actual doing of the act/offence by being  present or making him available for the purpose of  ensuring that the criminal act in furtherance of their  common intention is committed. The accused's  presence for the purpose for facilitating a criminal  act tantamounts to actual participation in the crimi-  nal act. All the accuseds including the principal  accused in furtherance of their common intention  participated in the offence with the knowledge that  there is some kind of help/assistance waiting nearby,  who are rendering such services/assistance to  achieve their common intention or object, and such  role of a participant, who is working along the same  line as the principal accused, can be heid to have  joined in commission of the offence under section  34 since he acted in furtherance of a common inten-  tion of all. The “presence” of an accused under sec-  tion 34 implies some kind of proximity with the  place of occurrence. This “proximity” is a relative  term which differs from facts to facts of cases or  which depends on the facts and circumstances of the  case. The presence or proximity of an accused for  the sake of section 34 does not necessarily require  the person to be physically present at the doorstep of  the place of occurrence in an extraordinary or  exceptional case. | am of the view that in special  extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, an  accused's presence can be proven under section 34  even if he is located at some distance from the place  of occurrence provided his position/location can be  shown to be in participation in the act for ensuring                    success in furtherance of the common intention of  all. These extraordinary and exceptional circum-  stances would depend on the facts and circum-  stances of cases.    ",
      "384. While commenting on section 34 of the  Penal Code the Supreme Court of India in the case  of Suresh vs State of UP reported in AJR 2001 SC  1344 at page 1348 para 21 observed as under:    “Even the concept of presence of the co-  accused at the scene is not a necessary require-  ment to attract section 34 i.e. the co-accused  can remain a little away and supply weapons to  the participating accused either by throwing or  by catapulting them so that the participating  accused can inflict injuries on the targeted per-  son. Another illustration, with advancement of  electronic equipment can be etched like this;  One of such persons in furtherance of the com-  mon intention, overseeing the actions from a  distance through binoculars can give instruc-  tions to the other accused through mobile  Phones as to how effectively the common inten-  tion can be implemented. We do not find any  teason why section 34 cannot apply in the case    Of those two persons indicated in the illustra-  tion.    of eat The Supreme Court of India in the case  5 yea Pande vs State of UP reported in AIR  Teg C 331 at page 332 para 2 has observed in  Pect of common intention in the following terms:      It is now well settled that the common  intention referred to in section 34 presuppose a    Or concern, a pre-arranged plan i.e, a prior    meeting of minds. This does not mean that there  must be a long interval of time between the for-  mation of common intention and the doing of  the act. It is not necessary to adduce a direct  evidence of the common intention. Indeed, in  many cases it may be impossible to do so. The  common intention may be inferred from the  surrounding circumstances and the conduct of    the parties    ",
      "383. Referring to the case of Bamaswami vs  sate of Tamil Nadu reported in AIR 1976 SC 2027,  further observed—    “Thus we find that some of the confessing  accused did not participate in the forcible taking  away of the six victims but they played their  part truly by remaining on guard so as to over-  come any outside interference with the attain-  ment of their object. All the essential conditions  so far the presence of a common intention were  clearly proved in this case. There cannot be a  clearer case of applicability of section 34 of the  Penal Code than this.”    "

The High Court also did not  accept the submissions of the learned Attorney-  General that, in terms of the principle laid down in  PLD 1988 Karachi 99, the matter of assessment of  customs duties of the goods in question be sent back  to the customs authority for making assessment after  hearing the respondents as the facts of the above  case are quite distinguishable from the facts of the  instant cases.    ",
      "10. As it appears, the High Court Division  made the Rules absolute holding that a reading of  the provisions of section 25(1)(2)(3) and section  30(1) of the Customs Act show that the Customs  Authority is authorised to assess customs duties of  imported goods at the value prevalent on the date  when the bill of entry is presented for assessment of  customs duties but, in the present case, the Customs  authority fixed the indicative value for the purpose  of assessment of customs duties of the imported  CDSO and CPO imported by the respondents long  before the presentation of the bill of entry and  accordingly, \"indicative value\", that has been fixed  by the circular dated 3-7-94, cannot be considered to  have been fixed in the light of the provisions of sec-  tion 25(1)(2) and (3) of the Customs Act and that in  terms of the above section the Customs Authority, in  appropriate cases, no doubt, is competent to fix nor-  mal value of imported goods upon rejection of the  invoice value or the declared value but in such a  case the Customs authority would be required to  notify importers informing them that the Customs  authority is not accepting the invoice value or  declared value as the basis for the purpose of assess-  ment of customs duty and is going to fix the normal  price of the imported goods for the assessment of  customs duties and the customs authority would also  be required to afford an opportunity to the importers  to place their cases, if any, in support of their claim  that the invoice value, in fact, is the normal price of  the imported merchandise for the purpose of assess-  ment of customs duties or that as against the  invoice/ declared value of the imported goods the  customs authority is going to tax the normal price of  the goods for the purpose of assessment of customs  duties but, in the instant case, that has not been done  by the customs authority and the Customs authority  fixed, through internal circular, certain prices of  CDSO and CPO for the purpose of assessment of  customs duties terming the same as \"indicative  value\" but under the Customs Act, the revenue real-                  ising Authority or the Customs Authority is autho-  rised to fix tariff value under section 25(7) of the Act  at a prior date through Gazette notification for the  purpose of a ment of customs duties and the  indicative value that has been fixed later on and cir-  culated through Circular dated 3-7-94 was admitted-  ly not notified in the official Gazette; the learned  Attomey-General submitted that the fixation of nor-  mal value in every case of imports upon notifying  the individual importer would be an impossible task  and, as such, for the sake of convenience, the rev-  enue authority has fixed the value of the imported  merchandise at a prior date through the Circular  dated 3-7-94 for making the same as the basis for  assessment of the customs duties in disregard of the  invoice value, but the above submission cannot be  accepted because in fixing the citizen with the lia-  bility of payment of tax, the concerned authority is  required by strict compliance of law authorising it to  fix a citizen with the liability of payment of tax and  the plea of impossibility of fixation of the normal  value of the imported merchandise in the case of  each individual importer upon hearing him or that  upon affording him an opportunity to place his case,  if any, in support of the invoice value, cannot be  accepted and the respondents, under the law, cannot  be allowed to resort to the practice of pre-fixation of  the value of the imported goods for assessment of  customs duties in that the Government or any other  agency authorised by the delegated legislation can-  not act in a manner which is not authorised or pro-  vided in the law or by the law; further, the affidavit  of the appellant does not show that price to the  CDSO and CPO at which those were sold by the  countries wherefrom import was made by the  respondents, being not taken into consideration at  the time of fixing the \"indicative value\", the state-  ment of the appellants in Annexure-2 to the affi-  davit-in-opposition to the effect that the price of  CDSO in the international market at the relevant  time was at about US$ 580/585 per metric tonne  , and, in that state of the matter, the appellants were  quite correct in fixing the value of the goods in ques-  tion at the amount circulated through the Circular    ",
      "9. The learned Counsel for the respondents  submitted that section 25 of the Customs Act, 1969  does not authorise the appellants to issue the circu-  lar dated 3-7-1994 and the same has been issued  arbitrarily and without lawful authority as section 25  envisages determination of normal value under sec-  tion 25(1) or fixation of tariff value by notifying  through Gazette under section 25(7) and does not  provide for determination of any \"indicative value\"  as done in the present case and the appellants did  not also make an attempt to determine normal  value under section 25(1) of the Act based on any  authentic. contemporary evidence upon notifying  the importer; further, since the points as raised in  the leave stage had not been taken before the Court  below, the appellants cannot raise such new points  now; after the bills of entry were presented consid-  erable time has already elapsed in the meantime  and, as such, the prayer of the appellants made at  this belated stage to allow them to determine nor-  mal value of the goods would amount to giving the  appellants highest latitude though they, all along,  acted in violation of law and tried to extract money  from the respondents by fixing \"indicative value\"  which is a foreign and unknown terminology; the  invoice value/C&F value of the goods imported by  the respondents being US$ 354 per metric tonne,  the customs duty and other taxes thereon should be  assessed on the basis of invoice value since there  was no tariff value on the date of presentation of  the bills of entry; the Circular dated 3-7-1994 and  orders dated 28-11-1994 and 29-11-94 have been  made without lawful authority, inasmuch as the  value sought to be fixed for assessment of customs  duties and other taxes on the said imported goods  is arbitrary and without lawful authority and there  is no authority conferred by section 25 to deter-  mine any ‘indicatiye value! by a circular as has  been done in the present case and section 25 of the  Customs Act did not authorise the appellants to  issue the impugned circular, inasmuch as section  25 only authorises to fix tariff value to be deter-  mined and fixed by Gazette notification under sec-  tion 25(7) and does not provide for any authority to  determine the value of imported goods by any cir-  cular.    ",
      "8. Mr Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney-  General appearing for the appellants in support of  the leave granting order, submitted that though the  appellants could not substantiate assessment on the  basis of indicative value as not being contemplated  under the Customs Act, but in terms of the provi-  sions of section 25(1) of the Customs Act in case of  disagreement with the invoice value the authority  was entitled to determine the normal price of the  imported goods and the High Court Division erred  in Jaw in not giving direction to assess the customs  duties and other taxes on the basis of normal price to  be determined in accordance with law considering  the prevalent market price at the country of origin  with an opportunity to the importers to produce any  paper or documents in support of their invoice val-  ues, inasmuch as the provisions of section 30 of the  Customs Act are applicable in respect of both the  value as well as rate of duty to any imported goods  on the date on which bill of entry is presented under  section 79 of the Act and, as such, the direction of  the High Court Division to make assessment on the  basis of the prevalent tariff value on the date of  opening of letter of credit, which stood deleted long  before the date of filing of the bill of entry, instead  of assessment of normal value of the import is not  sustainable and the finding of the High Court  Division that the respondents by opening of letter of  credit when tariff value was prevalent, acquired a  vested right of assessment on the basis of tariff, is  contrary to the principles as laid down in Mizunur  Rahman's case, 52 DLR (AD) 149 and further, the  Government has authority to determine the normal  prices and realise duty thereon at the rate prevailing  on the date of submission of the bill of entry.                  ",
      "7. The High Court Division, after hearing,  made the Rules absolute.    ",
      "6. The respondents filed affidavit-in-reply  contending that the Government is not competent to  fix any price like the indicative price and whatever  price is fixed by the Government for the purpose of  assessment of customs duties the same is Tequired to  be notified through official Gazette; the price that  has been fixed as indicative value by Circular dated  3-7-94 has no nexus to the international market  price of the CDSO and CPO; the Circular dated 3-7-  94 being merely internal communication has no  legal sanction for assessment of customs duties at a  rate different from the invoice value or at a value  higher than the prevalent tariff value; the appellants  have obtained the price of CDSO from the countries  which are not regular exporting countries and, as  such, fixation of the price on the basis thereof can-  not be considered as a dependable basis; the respon-  dents imported the CDSO and CPO at a price which  was quoted by their exporter and the appellants have  not obtained the price of CDSO and CPO prevalent  in the countries like Brazil and Argentina where-  from the respondents imported the CDSO and CPO  and, as such, the price that has been relied upon in  the fixation of price of CDSO and CPO as circulat-  ed through the Circular dated 3-7-94 has no nexus  and bearing in the matter of fixation of the value of  CDSO and CPO imported by the respondents; fur-  ther, the respondents opened the letter of credit prior  to the fixation of the indicative value and, as such,  indicative value fixed subsequent to the opening of  letters of credit is in no way applicable to the matter  of assessment of customs duties of the oil imported  by the respondents.    ",
      "5. The appellants filed affidavits-in-opposi.  tion in some of the writ petitions, which were useq  in all the writ petitions, contending that by the SRO  dated 9-6-1994, the tariff value on CDSO and Cpg  were deleted and even after the deletion of the tarifr  value the customs authority, in the absence of tariff  value, was competent to fix normal price of the  imported goods prevalent in the national and inter.  national markets under section 25(1) of the Customs  Act and in fixing the normal value by the Tax  Assessing Agency and the price shown in the  invoice was not binding upon the said agency and  the said circular dated 3-7-94 is an internal commu-  nication and the Customs Authority, being empow-  ered by the provisions of section 25(1) of the Act,  has fixed the normal price in advance; it is not cor-  rect that the current price of CDSO ranged from  USS 438 to 442 per metric tonne and for the purpose  of determination of normal price of CDSO and CPO  the appellants through their agencies, particularly  through Bangladesh Embassy in Malaysia, collected  price of CDSO which was at USS 574 per metric  tonne and taking into consideration the international  market price and the interest of the importers, busi-  ness communities and consumers, the Custoins  authorities fixed the indicative value of CDSO at  USS 575 per metric tonne and that when the bills of  entry were submitted there was no tariff value and  accordingly, the appellants did not commit any ille-  gality in giving the directions to the respondents to  declare the value of CDSO and CPO as mentioned  in the order made on the body of the bills of entry:  the object of fixing the price through the Circular  dated 3-7-1994 was to prevent under invoicing of  the value of the imported goods and accordingly. in  fixing the price circulated by the Circular dated 3-7-  94 the appellants acted quite fairly and reasonably in  exercise of their statutory power; further, it is alse  not correct that the respondents were not aware of  the above Circular dated 3-7-94 as they, against the  above circular, made representations to the appellant  No. 2 for reconsidering the value of CDSO and CPO                    so fixed and they in their above representations  admitted that they imported some quantity of CDSO  at the rate of US$ 580/585 per metric tonne and, as  such, it was very much clear that the price fixed by  the appellant No. 2 was the prevalent price of the  CDSO and CPO in the international market; the  association of the respondents also had dialogue  with the appellants in connection with the fixing of  the price of the imported goods and they, by their  letter dated 16-7-94, represented to the appellant  No. 2 to reconsider the matter of lowering the value  of CDSO and CPO as shown in the Circular of 3-7-  94 and to allow the respondents to take delivery of  the oil imported by them on assessment of customs  duty on the basis of tariff value in respect of imports  where letters of credit were opened prior to the dele-  tion of the tariff value.    ",
      "4. The common contentions of the respon-  dents in the above writ petitions were that the above  circular and orders (a) are contrary to the provisions  of Customs Act, (b) the impugned orders made by  the Customs authority in different Nathies for the  purpose of assessment of customs duties were arbi-  trary (c) there was no objective basis of fixation of  the value of CDSO and CPO, imported by the  respondents for the purpose of assessment of cus-  toms duties (d) the customs officials acted illegally  in giving direction to the respondents to declare  value at a value which the authorities fixed at their  level without notifying the same in the Gazette, (e)  the National Board of Revenue, the appellant No. 2,  as well as customs officials, are not legally autho-  rised to fix value of a particular imported merchan-  dise in advance for the purpose of assessment of  customs duties, (f) the appellant No. 2 as well as the  customs officials acted in a colourable manner in  fixing the value in advance for the purpose of  assessment of customs duties which in other way  was nothing but the tariff value and, as such, the  value so fixed, having not been notified in the offi-    ial Gazette, the action of the customs authority of  ing the predetermined value as per circular dated  3-7-94 is illegal; (g) there being no law authorising  the appellant No. 2 as well as customs officials to fix  value of any imported merchandise as indicative  value in advance for the purpose of assessment of  customs duties, the action of the appellants in mak-  ing direction to the respondents to declare the said    indicative value is violative of Article 31 of the  Constitution,    ",
      "3. The respondents in other appeals filed  respective writ petitions challenging similar orders  on the averments which are more or less similar.    ",
      "2. The respondent in Civil Appeal No. 8 of  2002 filed Writ Petition No. 2304 of 1994 on the  averments that they opened L/C dated 25-4-94 tor  import of 1000 metric tonnes of CDSO at the rate of  US $ 443 per metric tonne C&F Chittagong as  shown in the invoice and after arrival of the goods at                  Chittagong Port they, through their Clearing and  Forwarding Agent, submitted bill of entry of 22-8-  1994 for the purpose of assessment of customs  duties and other taxes and charges on the basis of  invoice value but the appellant No.1 directed the  respondents to declare the value of the imported  goods @ USS 574 per metric tone fixed as the  indicative value of the goods by the Memo dated 3-  7-1994 and also to show separately the freight paid  for the purpose of assessment of customs duties.    ",
      "1. Md Tafazzul Islam J : The above appeals. by  leave, are directed against the common judgment  and order dated 18-8-1998 of the High Court  Division passed in Writ Petition Nos. 1704, 2304,  2305, 1935, 1564, 1172, 1155, 1536, 1391, 1561,  1583, 2105, 1425, 1562, 2112, 1163, 1730, 1429,  1845, 2014, 2296, 2297, 2012 and 2015 of 1994  making absolute the Rules obtained impugning the  Circular dated 3-7-94 issued by the Controller,  Customs Valuation Division, the respondent No.4,  fixing the value of Crude Degummed Soybean Oil,  CDSO, and also Crude Palm Oil, CPO, as shown in  the above circular and also impugning the order,  dated 28-11-94 and 29-11-94 issued by the appellant  No.1 imposing duty based on the enhanced value of  USS 574.50 per metric tonne in terms of the above  Circular dated 3-7-94 in disregard of the invoice  value.

      "7. The High Court Division held that    \"As we have already observed that subse.  quent committee has no authority to review the  earlier decision. It appears that the order of ter.  mination, we find, is not a termination sim.  pliciter but it is with stigma, so the argument of  Mr AJ Mohammad Ali is that the order of ter-  mination is malafide in view of the attending  facts and circumstances of the case which can-  not be ignored. The question of malafide is  rather a disputed fact but what we find from the  facts and circumstances of the case is that the  argument of malafide is rather established and  cannot be altogether brushed aside. It appears  that once a person is appointed as Lecturer on  being recommended by a legally constituted  committee and the subsequent committee being  not a superior authority cannot sit over and  review the same as we have already considered.  Furthermore, the petitioner having joined the  post and worked as such a legal right has  accrued to him and this right cannot be taken  away in such an arbitrary manner. We, there-  fore, find substance in the Rule and the order of  termination of the petitioner is liable to be  declared as illegal and without lawful authority  and is of no legal effect. The petitioner is, there-  fore, entitled to be reinstated with all benefits of  back wages and maintaining his seniority. The  respondents are hereby directed to comply with  the judgment of this court forthwith.\"    ",
      "6. It appears that subsequent committee has no  authority to review the earlier decision. It appears  that the order of termination is not a termination  simpliciter but is with stigma. From the argument of  the learned Counsel it appears that the order of ter-  mination is malafide in view of the attending facts  and circumstances of the case, It appears that once  a person is appointed as Lecturer on being recom-  mended by a legally constituted committee and the  subsequent committee being not a superior authori-  ty cannot sit over and review the same. As the  respondent No. | had already joined the post and  worked as Lecturer, a legal right has accrued to him  and this right cannot be taken away in such an arbj.  trary manner. The decision reported in 44 DLR (AD,  305 has no manner of application in the attending  facts and circumstances of the case.    ",
      "5. Dr Abul Bashar, leaned Advocate, appear-  ing for the respondent No. 1, submitted that once a  person is appointed as a Lecturer on being recom-  mended by a legally constituted enquiry committee  and the subsequent enquiry committee, being not a  superior authority, has no jurisdiction to review the  decision of the earlier committee; that the very con-  stitution of the subsequent committee and all its  activities are ultra vires and malafide and do not  come within the purview of Article 53(3) of the  Dhaka University Order, 1973; that an order of te  mination with stigma of misconduct or order of di:  missal can only be made on the grounds as laid  down in Article 56(3) of the Dhaka University  Order, 1973 and a Tribunal must have been constituted                    in accordance with section 45(4) of the First  Statutes of Dhaka University Order, 1973 but in the  instant case the appellants had neither shown any  grounds nor constituted any tribunal as per the rele-  vant law. The leamed Advocate further submitted  that as per section 45(5) of the First Statutes of  Dhaka University Order, 1973 an appeal lies to the  Chancellor against any order passed by the Syndi-  cate on the recommendation of the Tribunal but not  against any order passed by the Syndicate on the  recommendation of the so-called enquiry committee  and, as such, the ground taken by the appellants with  regard to the non-exhaustion of the alternative  forum of appeal is not tenable in the eye of law; that  Article 52 of the Dhaka University Order, 1973 pro-  vides that the provision for appeal before the  Chancellor against any order of an officer or author-  ity of the University, which is not relevant in the  instant matter. In fact, the relevant provision in the  instant matter is provided in section 45(5) of the  First Statutes of Dhaka University Order, 1973,  which lays down that an appeal lies to the Chancel-  lor against any order passed by the Syndicate on the  recommendation of the Tribunal but no such, tribu-  nal was set up by the appellants as per section 45(4)  of the First Statutes of Dhaka University Order,  1973 .The learned Advocate further submitted that  the respondent No.1 duly joined the post of Lecturer  and performed his responsibilities without any fault,  therefore, a legal right has been accrued to him and  this right cannot be taken away in such an arbitrary  manner. The learned Advocate finally submitted that  the order of termination is not a termination sim-  pliciter but it is with a stigma of misconduct and  therefore, the impugned termination order does not  come within the ambit of condition No. 2 of the  appointment letter.    ",
      "73. The  learned Counsel further submitted that the High  Court Division failed to take into consideration that  the respondent No. 1 has no /ocus standi to file the  writ petition in violation of procedure contained in  the Dhaka University Order, 1973 (PO 11 of 1973).  The learned Counsel also submitted that the High  Court Division failed to take into consideration that  as per clause-2 of the appointment letter dated 11-5-  1997 of the respondent No. 1, appointing authority  i.e. the University, reserves the legal right to termi-  nate the service of the respondent No. | and the  appellants by the impugned order terminated the  service of the respondent No. | as per said clause-2  of the appointment letter of the respondent No. |  and, as such, the judgment and order of the High  Court Division is liable to be set aside for the ends  of justice. The learned Counsel finally submitted  that from the plain reading of the impugned order of  termination it will be abundantly clear that the same  is a simple order of termination simpliciter without  any stigma and, as such, the judgment and order of  the High Court Division is liable to be set aside for  the ends of justice.    ",
      "4. Dr Rafiqur Rahman, learned Counsel,  appearing for the appellants, submitted that Article  52 of the Dhaka University Order, 1973 (President's  Order 11 of 1973) providing an appeal against the  order of any officer or authority of the University  affecting any person or class of persons in the  University may be made by petition to the  Chancellor who shall send a copy on receipt of the  petition thereof to the officer or authority concerned,  and shall give such officer or authority an opportu-  nity to show cause as to why the appeal should not  be entertained. But the respondent No. 1 without  invoking and exhausting the alternative forum of  appeal as provided in the aforesaid Article 52 of the    University Order, 1973, filed the writ petition and in  view of the decision of the Appellate Division  passed in the case of Controller of Examinations,  University of Dhaka vs Mahinuddin reported in 44  DLR (AD) 305, the instant writ petition is not main-  tainable and the remedy lies in appeal to the  Chancellor under Article 52 of PO 11 of 19",
      "3. Leave was granted to consider the submis-  sions of the learned Counsel for the appellants that  Article 52 of the Dhaka University Order, 1973  (President's Order 11 of 1973) provides that :    \"52(1)—An appeal against the order of any  officer or authority of the University affecting  any person or class of persons in the University  may be made by petition to the Chancellor who  shall send a copy on receipt of the petition  thereof to the officer or authority concerned,  and shall give such officer or authority an  opportunity to show cause why the appeal  should not be entertained. But the respondent  No. 1 without invoking and exhausting the  alternative forum of appeal as provided in the  aforesaid Article 52 of the University Order,  1973, filed the writ petition and in view of the  decision of the Appellate Division passed in the  case of Controller of Examinations, University  of Dhaka vs Mahinuddin reported in 44 DLR  (AD) 305, the instant writ petition is not main-  tainable and the remedy lies in an appeal to the  Chancellor under Article 52 of PO 11 of 1973.\"    ",
      "2. The facts involved in the case, in short, are  that the respondent No. | as petitioner upon obtain-  ing Master Decree was appointed as Lecturer of  Dhaka City College in the Department of Islamic  History. Subsequently, in response to an advertise-  ment made by the Dhaka University he applied for  the post of Lecturer in the Department of Islamic  History and Culture; out of 10 applicants the rele-  vant committee recommended the names of 3 appli-  cants including the respondent for the said post. At  that time one Dr Ibrahim, Associate Professor of  Department of Islamic History, made a frivolous  objection regarding the respondent No. 1 on  appointment. Thereafter, selection committee on the  basis of C and D Committee selected the respondent  No. | in the post of Lecturer and referred the matter  to the Syndicate for taking final decision regarding  his appointment in view of the complaint made by  an Associate Professor. The Syndicate formed an  inquiry committee but failed to submit any report  within the stipulated time. As a result, the Syndicate  formed another committee, which after discussion,  took the view that the allegation of adopting unfair  means in the subsidiary examination against the  respondent would not be deemed to be a bar for his  appointment and accordingly, recommended the  respondent for appointment and exonerated him  from the complaint made by said Dr Ibrahim, an    Associate Professor. Thereafter, the appointment let-  ter was issued. On receipt of the appointment letter  the respondent No. 1 resigned from the post of  Lecturer of Dhaka City College and submitted his  joining letter with respondent No. 2 which was  accepted. While the respondent No. 1 was serving  as a Lecturer in the University, the respondent No. 2  on the basis of news published in the newspaper  formed another committee for further inquiry.  Thereafter, the respondent No. 1 was served with a  show cause notice to which the respondent No. I  replied, then a new inquiry committee was formed  by the Syndicate and the said committee served  another show cause notice upon the respondent No.  | to which he replied. The respondent No. 1 was  then asked not to participate in Departmental func-  tion till disposal of the inquiry. The inquiry com-                  mittee gave a report and an opinion regarding, his  appointment and forwarded the same to the Syndi-  cate to take a final decision. He then received impug-  ned letter issued by the respondent No. 2 stating,  inter alia, that the service of the respondent No. 1  was no longer required i.e. his service has been ter-  minated in accordance with the appointment letter,    ",

Mr Rafique-ul-Hugq, on the other hand,  contends that since the Government has recom-  mended for withdrawal of the case from the prose-  cution against the writ petitioner, no fruitful purpose  will be served if the order of the High Count  Division is interfered with.    9 In the writ petition the petitioner stated  that he is \"presently being in abroad is not in a posi-  tion to swear the Affidavit of the instant writ peti-  tion.

Mr Md Khurshid Alam Khan, the  learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the  High Court Division erred in law in entertaining the  writ petition and staying all further proceedings o,  the case in failing to consider that the writ petition.  er was fugitive from justice when he moved the peti-  tion and thus he was not entitled to any relief.

      "3. On 22-3-2007 the Deputy Director of the  Anti-Corruption Commission lodged an FIR with  Dhanmondi Police Station against the respondent  No.1 and Barrister Nazmul Huda and the said case  was registered as Dhanmondi Police Station Case  No.70 dated 21-3-2007 under section 5(2) of the  Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with sec-  tions 26 and 27 of the Anti-Corruption Commission  Act, 2004 and section 109 of the Penal Code alleg-  ing, inter alia, that the informant has been working  as an enlisted contractor with the Roads and  Highways Department under the Ministry of Com-  munications since 1988 and received S(five) work  Orders from the Ministry of Communications on 14  December, 2004, 10 March 2005, 22 January, 2004  (two work orders) and 04 November, 2004 respec-  tively. Upon receiving the above mention 3 (five)  work orders Mir Zahir Hossain went to the then  Communications Minister Mr Nazmul Huda's house  and personally paid him altogether Taka 2,40,00,000  (taka two crore and forty lac) in three cheques as  bribe for the said work orders on 12 February 2005  and 21 April 2005 respectively. Out of the said sum  of Taka 2,40,00,000 (taka two crore and forty lac)  amounting Taka 1 crore and another cash cheque                    amounting Taka 40,00,000 (Taka forty lac only) was  deposited in the account of a weekly publication  called \"the Khoborer Ontoraley\" owned by the  respondent No.1 on 17th February 2004 and 23rd  April 2004 respectively.

However the deposit was not made within  the time allowed and accordingly the order for making                  the opposite party No. 7 as co-applicant stood  rejected for non-compliance of the order dated 4-6-  2001 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, now  Joint District’ Judge, in the —Pre-emption  Miscellaneous Case No. 47 of 2002 .

      "8. We have perused the judgment passed by the  Appellate Division referred to above as well as the  orders passed by the trial Court and the learned  District Judge as well the impugned judgment and  order. We have also perused the provisions of sec-  tion 96 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, It  appears that the provision for pre-emption under the  State Acquisition and Tenancy Act is a special law  and specific time frame has been given for making  application for pre-emption. There is also provision  for making the application to become co-applicant  praying for rateable pre-emption of land subject to  deposit of money as may be directed by the Court,  on an application to be filed by an applicant. In the    instant case an application was file by the opposite    party No. 7 and the trial Court allowed the prayer of  the opposite party No, 7 to become a co-applicant    subject to deposit of the consideration money  together with the statutory compensation amount  within 17-6-2001, in default the application for co.  applicant shall be deemed to have been rejected. and  that the said opposite party No. 7 failed to deposit  the amount within time allowed. He, however, took  extensions of the time on several occasions and ulti-  mately he moved the revisional jurisdictions of both  the District Judge and the High Court Division in  due course and obtained orders of stay of operation  of the order passed by the trial Court for deposit of  money and being unsuccessful ultimately moved the  Appellate Division, which refused to interfere with  the judgment and order of the High Court Division  vide judgment and order dated 5-5-2003. The pre-  emption law provides four months time for filing an  application for pre-emption from the date of knowl-  edge and that any opposite party in the pre-emption  case is permitted to file an application for adding  him/her as an co-applicant with prayer for rateable  pre-emption of the land within two months and is  required to deposit the amount, as may be ordered  for, within the period allowed by the Court and, such  provision is mandatory inasmuch as this special pro-  vision of law provides special limitation and there-  fore the limitation as provided in the law itself shall  prevail over the normal law of limitation.   ",
      "7. We have perused the leave petition and heard  the learned Advocate, who, amongst others, submit-  ted that under the provisions of section 148 of the  Code of Civil Procedure the Court has ample power  to extend the time for deposit of the consideration  money and accordingly the required amount has  been deposited within the extended time allowed by  the Court, which aspect has not been considered by  the High Court Division, and thus arrived at an erro-  neous decision and that the High Court Division  erred in holding that the limitation provided for pre-  emption under section 96 of the State Acquisition  and Tenancy Act, is a special provision and accord-  ingly held that the deposit not being made within  time allowed, there is no scope to extend such time  and deposit made is not legal and that the High  Court Division arrived at an erroneous decision  since failed to appreciate the observation of the  Appellate Division made on 5-5-2003 in Civil  Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 328 of 2003 and  thus the decision of the High Court Division has  occasioned failure of justice.    ",
      "6. Being aggrieved’ there against Said opposite  party No. 7 unsuccessfully moved the Appellate  Division in civil petition for leave to appeal No. 328  of 2003 filed against the judgment and order dated  5-5-2003 . Thereafter the said opposite party No. 7  on 19-5-2003 deposited Taka 1,65,000 through cha-  lan and filed an application in the trial Court for  adding him as Co-applicant, which was rejected,  since no deposit w thade'i in terms and order passed  on 4-6-2001 and against that the said opposite party  No. 7 moved the” strict Judge under revisional  jurisdiction in Civil Revision No. 14 of 2004 and on  contest the Rule was made absolute setting aside the                    order of the Court below and hence the pre-emptor  moved the High Court Division in Civil Revision  No. 3872 of 2004, wherein Rule was issued and on  contest the Rule has been discharged by the  impugned judgment and order, Hence the leave peti-  tion.    ",
      "5. The learned Subordinate Judge on considera-  tion of the application allowed the prayer of the  opposite Party No. 7 vide order No. 25 dated 4-6-  2001 subject to deposit of the consideration money  together with the compensation amount within 17-6-  2001 and also ordered for modification of the suit  register by including the name of the opposite party  No. | as co-applicant after submission of the chalan  showing deposit of the money, in default the appli-  cation for co-pre-emptor shall be deemed to have  been rejected. The said opposite party No. 7 failed  to comply with the order, he however took exten-  sions of time, from time to time, and by filing Civil  Revision No. 3977 of 2001 in the High Court  Division obtained a Rule and an order of stay of  operation of the said order No. 25 dated 4-6-2001 of  the Court below vide order dated 22-6-2001. The  opposite party No, 7 claimed in the Civil Revision  Case before the High Court Division that there is no  provision for making statutory deposit before the  final determination of the share ‘of the co-applicant  in the pre-emption case filed under the State  Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 and that, after  hearing, the said rule. was discharged.

      "4. The aforesaid Miscellaneous Case arises out  of application filed under section 96 of the State  Acquisition and Tenancy Act in the Court of  Subordinate Judge, 2nd Court, Moulvibazar, regis-  tered as Miscellaneous Case No. 2 of 2001, which  on transfer has been registered as Pre-emption  Miscellaneous Case No. 47 of 2003 in the Ist Court  of Joint District Judge, Moulvibazar.

The opposite party  No. 7 being co-sharer by inheritance on receipt of  notice from Court filed application under section 96  (4) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act on 29-  5-2001 to become co-applicant praying for rateable  pre-emption in the case land.    ",
      "3. We have also considered the petition on  merit. Leave has been prayed for filing appeal  against the judgment and order dated 20-5-2007  passed in Civil Revision No. 3872 of 2004 by the  High Court Division discharging the Rule, which  was issued calling in question the judgment and  order dated 26-7-2004 passed in Civil Revision No.    4 of 2004 by the learned District Judge,  Moulvibazar, making the Rule absolute setting aside  the judgment and order dated 12-2-2004 passed in  Miscellaneous Case No. 47 of 2003 (Pre-emption)  by the Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Moulvibazar.    ",
      "2. The application is time barred. The expla-  nation given for the delay of 15 days in filing appeal  appears to be not satisfactory, hence the delay is not  condoned.    ",

We have perused the writ petition as well ay  the order dated 2-1-2005 and 9-1-2005 passed in  Mortgage Execution Case No. 8 of 1995 and the  Judgment and order passed in the writ petition ang  considered the submission made by the learneq  Advocate appearing for the leave petitioner. {,  appears that the leave petitioner bank is negligent jn  not informing the executing Court about the fact of  restoration of the rule and stay dated 15-6-2006 and  that the leave petitioner bank by filing an applica-  tion on 25-6-2006 prayed for receiving the pay order  submitted by the auction purchaser in Court and it  appears from the impugned judgment and order  passed by the High court Division that the leave  petitioner bank has already encashed the pay order  and thereby accepted the auction sale. In view of  the provision of law to the effect that once an auc-  tion sale is complete no relief is available against  such auction sale but the mortgagee may proceed  against the mortgagor bank for any compensation, if  it is proved that there was illegality in the auction  sale. In the instant case, it is not such case rather it  appears that at the instance of the decree-holder-  bank auction was held and ultimately the decree-  holder-bank has withdrawn the money deposited by  the auction purchasers. After the auction process is  completed, proceeding with the execution case is  redundant.    ",
      "4. The learned Advocate appearing for the writ  petitioner bank submitted that the orders relating to  auction sales were passed by the Executing Court  inspite of the order of stay granted by the High  Court Division being in force inasmuch as the Rule  issued in Writ Petition No. 687 of 2005 though dis-  charged on 22-5-2006 for default but the same was  restored on 15-6-2006 and, as such, the order passed    by the Executing Court after 15-6-2006 are without  lawful authority, hence the order relating to confir-  mation of auction sale is without lawful authority,    ",
      "3. The High Court Division also observed that  earlier the Rule was discharged for default as no one  appeared on 22-5-2006 and the order of stay grant-  ed earlier was vacated and the executing Court was  directed to proceed with the execution case in accor-  dance with law and that on the prayer of the peti-  tioner bank the writ petition was restored to its orig-  inal file and number on 15-6-2006 recalling the  default order dated 22-5-2006 but it appears from  the order sheet of Execution Case No. 8 of 1995  annexed to the leave petition the order relating to  restoring of the Rule was not communicated to the  Court below and that an application was filed in the  Executing Court for proceeding with the execution  case on 4-7-2006 pursuant to which the Executing  Court proceeded with the execution proceeding.  Being aggrieved, the writ petitioner bank filed the  leave petition.    ",
      "2. The Rule arises out of an order dated 2-]-  2005 and 9-1-2005 passed in Mortgage Execution  Case No. 8 of 1995 by the Artha Rin Adalat,  Narayanganj, rejecting the application for cancella-  tion of the auction bid held on the date i.e. on 2-1-  2005 and acceptance of the highest bid amount of  Taka 9,04,000 directing deposit of the balance auc-  tion-bid amount through pay order on 12-1-2005  and the order rejecting the review petition filed  against the order dated 2-1-2005 and also an appli-  cation filed on 4-1-2005 by the decree-holder-bank  for issuing certificate under section 33(5) of the  Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 canceling the auction.  The writ petitioner bank filed the Title Suit No. 262  of 1992 (Artha Rin) in the Court of learned Sub-  ordinate Judge and Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka,  for recovery of Taka 32,45,037.81 as of 30-9-1992  with 20% interest till realization and the suit was  decreed ex-parte on 28-11-1993, pursuant to which  the writ-petitioner bank filed an application for  drawing up of the final decree permitting sale of the  mortgage property and accordingly a final decree  was passed and drawn up on 30-5-1994 and there-  after the writ petitioner filed Mortgage Execution  Case No. 8 of 1995 for execution of the decree.  Thereafter auction notice was published in \"The  Dainik-al-Muzadded\" and in \"Dainik Ittefaq\" invit-  ing bid against the sale of the mortgaged property  worth Taka 25,00,000 and on 2-1-2005 bids against  tender were received, in which the highest bid  amount was Taka 9,04,000 and as the bid amount  was exorbitantly low the writ-petitioner bank filed  an application for cancelling the auction which was.  refused and the said bid was accepted by the Court.  Being aggrieved, the writ petitioner filed an applies  tion for review of the order dated 2-1-2005 and also  filed an application for issuing certificate as per section                     33(5) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 in  favour of the writ petitioner bank to vest the proper-  ty in its favour and name but the aforesaid two appli-  cations were refused and thus being aggrieved the  writ-petitioner bank challenged the aforesaid orders  dated 2-1-2005 and 9-1-2005 in the writ petition,  wherein, the rule was issued. Thereafter, the High  Court Division by its judgment and order dated 17-  4-2007 discharged the Rule observing, amongst oth-  ers, that:    \"the petitioner bank has already withdrawn  the sale proceeds and since the sale has been  confirmed by the executing Court and sale cer-  tificate has already been issued, the title of the  property has already been vested upon the auc-  tion purchaser.\"    ",
      "1. SAN Mominur Rahman J: This leave petition is  directed against the judgment and order dated 17-4-  2007 passed in Writ Petition No. 687 of 2005 by the  High Court Division discharging the Rule.    "

The  High Court Division, further misconceived the amended  section 32 and wrongly held that a further sanction is  required to take cognizance of the offence by the Court  inspite of the sanction given earlier under sub-section (2)  of section 32 of the Act. sesee( 15)  ",

      "16. As regards the decisions cited by the  learned Counsel in Akhtar Hossain Khan vs State.  29 DLR (SC) 101, Mofazzal Hossain Mollah vs  State, 45 DLR (AD) 175 and TS Baliah vs TS  Rangachari, AIR 1969 (SC) 701, Md Nizamuddin vs  State, 30 DLR 49(FB), Abul Kalam Khan vs Riza  Morshed, 5 BLC 2000, 1 am persuaded not to make  any observation as to the applicability of these deci-  sions at this stage of the proceedings. The appellant  would be entitled to raise the statements of law  argued in those cases in the trial Court.    ",
      "15. Whether the appellant has disproportionate  wealth, whether he has concealed his known source  of income, whether there is mis-joinder of charges  and whether the trial of the appellant on facts  allegedly committed prior to the promulgation of  Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 constitute  an offence under the Durnity Daman Commission  Ain are disputed facts can only be decided on evi-  dence at the trial. This is not a case that the allega-  tions as disclosed in the first information report and  the police report do not disclose any offence. If  accepting the allegations made and charges levelled  on their face value, the Court had come to the con-  clusion that no offence was disclosed, the matter  would have been different. In view of the above, |  am of the view that there is no legal impediment to  proceed with the trial of the case.    ",
      "14. Since the prosecution case is almost over  and the appellant put his defence by cross-examin-  ing the witnesses, in view of the consistent views of  the superior Courts of this sub-continent that the  High Court Division which exercising its power  under section 561A of the Code of Criminal  Procedure should not usurp the jurisdiction of the  trial Court, the learned Judges have acted in accor-  dance with Jaw. The powers under this provision  have been vested in the High Court Division to  quash a proceeding to prevent the abuse of the  process of the Court but that power cannot be exer-  cised to hold a parallel trial only on the basis of the  allegations made in the first information report, the  police report and the documents collected during the  enquiry or investigation of the case for the purpose  of expressing an opinion whether the accused is  likely to be punished if the trial is allowed to pro-  ceed. It will be for the trial Court to examine  whether on the evidence to be adduced by the pros-  ecution it is established that the accused has dispro-  portionate to his known source of income or that he  has committed an offence by concealment of and/or  suppression of wealth as per provisions of Durnity  Daman Commission Ain, The Court is required to    look into the allegations made in the first informa-  tion report that whether the same discloses any  offence or not. If the allegations do not disclose an  offence the High Court Division is perfectly justi-  fied in invoking its inherent power on the reasoning  that the continuation of the proceeding is a sheer  abuse of the process of the Court.    ",
      "13. In State of Delhi vs Gyan Devi, AIR 2001 SC  40, the accused persons stood charged under sec-  tions 302/34 of the Penal Code and thereafter five  witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecu-  tion and at that stage, the prosecution filed an appli-  cation intimating the Court that it had no other med-  ical evidence to be adduced in the case other than  that was proved by Dr VV Gupta (PW 3). Under  such circumstances the accused persons filed an  application for their discharge. The prayer was  rejected by the trial Court. A Single Judge of the  Delhi High Court quashed the order of framing  charge against the accused person found on sifting  the evidence of PWs 1-4 in the light of the autopsy  report. Question arose before the Supreme Court  was whether the learned Judge of the High Court  was justified in invoking inherent power at this late  stage of the proceeding. The Supreme Court in the  facts of the given case interfered with the order of  the High Court on the reasoning that the High Court  exceeded its jurisdiction and observed as under:    \"The High Court has erred in its approach  to the case as if it was evaluating the medical  evidence for the purpose of determining the  question whether the charge under sections  304/34, IPC framed against the accused respon-  dents 1 and 2 was likely to succeed or not. This  question was to be considered by the trial Judge                  after recording the entire evidence in the case.  It was not for the High Court to pre-judge the  case at the stage when only a few witnesses  (doctors) had been examined by the prosecution  and that too under the direction of the High  Court in the revision petition filed by the  accused. The High Court has not observed that  the prosecution had closed the evidence from its  side, There is also no discussion or observation  in the impugned order that the facts and cir-  cumstances of the case make it an exceptional  case in which immediate interference of the  High Court by invoking its inherent jurisdiction  under section 482, CrPC is warranted in the  interest of Justice. On consideration of the mat-  ter we have no hesitation to hold that the order  under challenge is vitiated on account of erro-  neous approach of the High Court and it is  clearly unsustainable.\"    ",
      "12. These views have been argued following the  dictum in RP Kapur vs State of Punjab, AIR 1960  SC 866 . The arguments made by PB Gajendragad-  kar, J, in the said case have been endorsed in verba-  tion by Ahsanuddin Chowdhury J, in Abdul Quader  Chowdhury vs State, 28 DLR (AD) 38 . In this case  it has been reiterated that the inherent jurisdiction  should not be invoked where some other remedy is  available. The jurisdiction given by section 561A is  not an alternative or an additional jurisdiction but it  is a jurisdiction preserved in the interest of justi  redress grievances for which no other procedure is  available or has been provided by the Code. This  power cannot be utilized as to interrupt or divert the  Ordinary Course of Criminal Procedure.        ",
      "11. In Amar Chand Agarwala vs Shanti Bose  AIR 1973 SC 799, the charges were framed by the  Chief Presidency Magistrate in presence of the  accused. Several prosecution witnesses had been  examined and at that stage one of the accused per                  son moved a petition for quashing the proceedings.  The Calcutta (Kolkata) High Court quashed the pro-  ceeding. The Supreme Court interfered with the  judgment of the High Court on the arguments that  the accused did not move the Court at the earliest  stage When the Magistrate had issued process, Nor  had the accused approached the High Court when  the charges were framed. On consideration of the  materials the Magistrate framed charged against all  the accused. It was observed that if the case of the  accused was that the allegations in the complaint do  not constitute the offence complained of or that the  complaint has to be quashed for any ground avail-  able in law, they should have approached the High  Court, at any rate, immediately after the charges  were framed. PB Gajendragadkar, J, argued for the  Supreme Court then observed as under :    \"It has been emphasised that the inherent  jurisdiction could be exercised to quash pro-  ceedings in a proper case, either to prevent the  abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise  to secure the ends of justice. This Court has also  indicated some of the categories of cases where  the inherent jurisdiction could and should be  exercised to quash proceedings. However the  exercise of the power by the High Court in the  case before us, does not come within the ambit  of the principles laid down by this Court in the  above decision. For instance the second con-  tention taken before the High Court by the  accused related to the maintainability of the  second complaint when the first complaint had  been withdrawn and the accused had been dis-  charged. If the High Court had accepted the  contention of the accused in that regard it may  be that the High Court was justified in quashing  the proceedings though at a very late stage. But  on that point, the High Court's decision is in  favour of the complainant. The other points  taken into account by the High Court do not jus-  tify the exercise of its power under section  561A and that too at a very late stage of the pro-  ceedings.\"    ",
      "10. In Md Shamsuddin @ Lambu vs State, 40  DLR (AD) 69, it has been argued by Shahabuddin  Ahmed, J that this power \"may be exercised only in  those cases which are not covered by any specific  provision of the Court. The inherent power of the  Court is undefined and indefinite and, as such, it  must be exercised very sparingly and with great cau-  tion\". Similar views have been expressed in the  State of Uttar Pradesh vs Mohammad Naim, PLD  1964 SC 703 as under:    \"It is now well settled that the section con-  fers no new powers on the High Court. It mere-  ly safeguards all existing inherent powers pos-  sessed by a High Court necessary (among other  purposes) to secure the ends of justice. The sec-  tion provides that those powers which the Court  inherently possesses shall be preserved lest it be  considered that the only powers possessed by  the Court are those expressly conferred by the  Code and that no inherent powers had survived  the passing of the Code (see Jairam Das vs  Emperor, AIR 1945 PC 94 and Emperor vs  Nazir Ahmed, AIR 1945 PC 18).\"    ",
      "9. The Superior Courts of this sub-continent  have settled the scope and power of the High Court  Division to quash a proceeding by invoking its  inherent power under section 561A of the Code of  Criminal Procedure. Inherent jurisdiction of the  High Court Division can be exercised in a proper  case to quash proceedings ‘to secure the ends of jus-  tice’. Ordinarily criminal proceedings instituted  against an accused should have been tried under the  provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and  the High Court Division is always reluctant in inter-  fering with the said proceedings at an interlocutory  stage by invoking its power. In this connection I  would like to reiterate the arguments made by the  Supreme Court of Pakistan in MS Khawaja vs State,  PLD 1965 SC 287 = 17 DLR SC 153 as under :    \"Every prosecution for a criminal offence  is to be deemed to have been commenced and  continued in the public interests, as a duty of the  State. It can only be in a very rare case that a  superior Court acting under its inherent power  ‘to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or  otherwise to secure the ends of justice, would  deem it appropriate to act so as to place an  alleged offence outside the operation of the  criminal law, on incidental grounds, such as that  of delay, or for any reasons other than reasons    going to the question whether the allegation js  sufficient to constitute an accusation of an  offence in law............ To quash a judicial  proceeding in order to secure the ends of justice’  would involve a finding that if permitted to con-  tinue, that proceeding would defeat the ends of  justice, or in other words, would either operate  or perpetuate an injustice. To find an ‘abuse’ jt  would be necessary to see in the proceeding’ a  perversion of the purpose of the law such as to  cause harassment to an innocent party, to bring  about delay, or where the machinery of justice  is engaged in an operation from which no result  in furtherance of justice can accrue, and similar  perverse results.\"    ",
      "8. The word 'process' is a general word meaning  in effect anything done by a Court, \"Abuse of the  process of the Court\" is generally applied to a case  or proceeding which is wanting in bonatides and is  frivolous or vexatious. Inherent power of the High                  Court Division is generally exercised where no  other remedy is available for obtaining justice in the  cause-it should not be invoked where another reme-  dy is available. This power has not been vested upon  the High Court Division where another remedy is  available. This is an extraordinary power and is  exercised in extraordinary circumstances in the  interest of justice. This power is controlled by the  principles and precedents as are its express statutory  powers. The provisions of the Code provide that the  administration of criminal justice should be allowed  to proceed in the usual manner without interruption.  If the High Court Division interferes with the case in  the midst of the trial it will have to set up a wrong  precedent by which instead of the cause of justice  being advanced had really been stifled.    ",
      "7. Before framing charge the appellant moved  an application under section 241A of the Code of  Criminal Procedure for the discharge. The learned  Special Judge by his order dated 14th May, 2008  rejected the application and framed charge. The  appellant did not take any exception against the said  order of framing charge by rejecting his application  under section 241A and surrendered to the jurisdic-  tion of the Special Judge. He could have moved the  High Court Division a revision petition against that  order if he was at all aggrieved against the order of  framing charge. Admittedly the appellant moved  the High Court Division after examination of 17  prosecution witnesses. As noticed, the learned  Counsel appearing for the appellant had totally  given a go-bye to the points agitated before the High  Court Division and tried to make out a third case in  this Division.    ",
      "6. The learned Judges of the High Court  Division considered the points agitated meticulous-  ly and disposed of all the points on assigning prop-  er reasons. The learned Judge thereupon concluded  by observing the case is now at that stage where  good number of witnesses have been examined, and  cross-examined, as such we do not find any urged to  invoke our inherent jurisdiction to quash the pro-  ceeding of this count\" and discharged the rule on the  reasoning that quashment of the proceeding at this  belated stage cannot be entertained. The learned  Judge of the High Court Division have considered  the pros and cons of the matter and found that it is  not a fit case for invoking its jurisdiction under sec-  tion 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The  High Court Division gave convincing reasons while  discharging the rule.    ",
      "5. The learned Judge of the High Court  Division having found no substance to points can-  vassed discharged the rule on the reasoning that the  period of limitation for enquiry or investigation as  provided in the Durnity Daman Commission Ain  and the Rules framed thereunder were directory in  nature, that the time limit provided in Rule 10 of the  Durnity Daman Commission Rules for conclusion  Of investigation and section 6A of the Criminal Law  Amendment Act, 1958 for conclusion of trial are  directory in nature, that there was no violation of    law that the sanction for prosecution of the appellant  was given in accordance with law and that there was  no misjoinder of charges.    ",
      "4. Before the High Court Division it was argued  on behalf of the appellant that the enquiry into the  matter having been made ignoring sub-rules (1), (2)  & (5) of the Durnity Daman Commission Rules,  2007 the case was instituted in violation of Rules. It  was further urged that no proper sanction was  obtained in accordance with section 32(1) of the  Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 read with  Rule 15(7) of the Dumity Daman Commission  Rules and since the sanction was given in a mechan-  ical way; it was not a sanction in the eye of law. It  was further urged that there was mis-joinder of  charges, inasmuch as, the offences alleged to have  committed from 1971 to June 2007 and thus, there is  violation of section 234 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure. The last point was raised is that the trial  having not been concluded within the prescribed  period of limitation the continuation of the proceed-  ing is a sheer abuse of the process of the Court.

Mr Rafique-ul-Huq and Mr Azmalul Hos-  sain extensively argued on behalf of the appellant on  the point of jurisdiction of the Special Judge to hold  trial of the offence punishable under section 26(2)  and 27(1) of the Durnity Daman Commission Ain.  2004 over an occurrence alleged to have been com-  mitted from 1971 to June 2007, Their main con-                  tention is that the Anti-Corruption Ain came into  force on 9th May, 2004 but the alleged occurrence  took place long before coming into force of the said  Ain and institution of the case for alleged offences  committed prior to coming of the aforesaid Ain with  retrospective effect is totally illegal and without  jurisdiction, In this connection learned Counsel  have referred certain provisions of the Anti-Corrup-  tion Act, 1957, the Durnity Daman Commission  Ain, 2004, relevant rules of Durnity Daman  Commission Rules, 2007, section 6 of the General  Clauses Act and Articles 31 & 35(1) of the  Constitution.    ",
      "2. The case record was eventually sent to the  Metropolitan Senior Special Judge, Dhaka for put-  ting the appellant on trial where Special Case No. 10  of 2008 was registered. Learned Special Judge after  taking cognizance of the offences framed charge    against the appellant under sections 26(2) and 270,  of the Durnity Daman Commission Ain on 14th  May, 2008 . The appellant pleaded not guilty ang  claimed to be tried. The prosecution examined 17  witnesses out of 25 witnesses cited in the Police  report and the appellant thoroughly cross-examined  them. It is at this stage the appellant came up wit)  an application for quashing of the proceedings of the  case before the High Court Division. The learned  Judges of the High Court Division by judgment ang  order dated 20th November, 2008 discharged the    _ Tule, Thereafter the appellant moved this Division 4    leave petition, This Division granted leave to con-  sider the following points:    \"the Anti-Corruption Commission Act,  2004 came into effect on and from 9-5-2()4  and unless any complaint, investigation,  enquiry, filing of case or sanction were com-  menced or were pending under the Anti-Cor-  ruption Act, 1957 or the Anti-Corruption  (Tribunal) Ordinance, 1960, the complaint,  investigation, enquiry, filing of case or sanction  cannot be tried under the Anti-Corruption  Commission Act, 2004 as they do not come  within the transitional provisions contained in  section 38 thereof inasmuch as the provision of  section 27(1) has been wrongly applied in the  facts and circumstances of the case and the  High Court Division committed an error of law  contrary to Article 35(1) of the Constitution in  failing to consider that some of the alleged acts  relied upon in the first information report  charge sheet and the charge frame order of the  trial Court, were committed between 1971 and  9-5-2004 i.e. before enactment of the Anti-  Corruption Commission Act, 2004.\"    ",
      "1. SK Sinha J: The appellant Habibur Rahman  Mollah, ex-member of Parliament, submitted his  statement of wealth including the members of his  family to the Durnity Daman Commission in pur-  suance of its letter under memo dated 29th May,  2007 directing him to submit as such. The Commis-  sion upon scrutiny for his wealth statement having  suspected the statement as not true, made a thorough  enquiry and it was said that he had concealed his  wealth and submitted a falls return and that he had  acquired property worth Taka 2 crore and odd by  corrupt means. Accordingly an officer of the Com-  mission lodged an first information report with the  Ramna Police Station on 3rd October, 2007 against  him for alleged commission of offences punishable  under sections 26(2) and 27(1) of the Durnity  Daman Commission Ain, 2004 read with Rule  15Gha (5) of the Emergency Powers Rules, 2007.  The Commission investigated into the matter and  having allegedly found disproportionate to the  appellant's known source of income was of the opin-  ion that he had committed offence punishable under  the said provisions of law and accordingly submit-  ted a police report re-commending for prosecution  of the appellant under the aforesaid provision on  20th April, 2008.    ",
      "15. In view of the evidence and materials on  record the concurrent findings of fact as regards title  and possession arrived at by both the trial Court as  well as the appellate Court below are sound and sus-  tainable both in fact and law. The view taken by the  learned Judges of the High Court Division in send-  ing the case on remand is therefore erratic and per-  verse and the impugned judgment is accordingly set  aside and the judgment and decree passed by the  trial Court as well as the appellate Court below are  hereby restored.    The appeal is accordingly allowed without any  order as to costs.    Ed.    APPELLATE DIVISION    (Civil)  Md Tafazzul Islam J | Abdul Gafur and others...  Md Abdul AzizJ |v...

      "14. It is now well settled that the remand orders  are not to be made as a matter of Course. The High  Court Division as a revisional Court is required to  properly appreciate the relevance of the evidence on  record before making such order of remand. The  case of Probodh Ranjan Shome ys Md Easin, 4  BSCR (AD) 457 may be referred to in this connec-  tion. Since there is no necessity for taking any fur-  ther evidence in the interest of resolution of the dis-  pute on title, the order of remand passed by the High  Court Division cannot be sustained. The case of  Sukumar Sen vs Gouranga Dey, 42 DLR (AD) 18  can be profitably cited on the point.    ",
      "13. Suit can be remanded by the appellate Court  with direction for giving findings and decision on  certain issues where the trial Court omitted to do so.  In terms of section 107 of the Code of Civil  Procedure the appellate Court has the power of  remand of a case under the circumstances mentioned                  in Order XLI, rules 23 and 25 . The appellate  Court can also exercise the power of remand in exer-  cise of its inherent power. The power of remand by  the appellate Court is not limited to specific case  mentioned in rule 23, The Court may also order a  remand in cases other than those covered under rule  23 and may do so also under section 151 of the Code  if it becomes necessary for the ends of justice. Even  the High Court Division can make an order of  remand while exercising revisional Jurisdiction if it  is so required for full and effective adjudication of  all the relevant points involved in a case. No  remand order can however be made to facilitate a  party to fill up the lacuna in his case.    ",
      "12. Besides, since the said solenama, on the  basis of which the said criminal case was compro-  mised between the parties, was prepared on the basis  of the said partition deed dated 24-3-1956 to which  the predecessors of the plaintiffs, Mohammad Mia  and Khairunnessa, were not parties, non-considera-  tion of the solenama by the Court below did not viti-  ate their concurrent finding that Mohammad Mia  and defendant No. 1 Khairunnessa acquired title to  the suit land and had possession thereof by virtue of  the said kabala deed dated 19-10-1955 . It is there-  fore palpably clear that despite sufficient evidence  being available on record in support of the concur-  rent finding of the trial'as well as appellate Court  below as regards title and possession of the plaintiffs  the impugned judgment of the High Court Division  for remand of the suit for determination of title and  Partition cannot be sustained in law. The order of  remand betrays lack of judicial acumen of the  learned Judge to make a proper judgment on appre-  ciation of the evidence on record. When the dispute  could effectively be resolved on the basis of evi-  dence on record the High Court Division would not  be permitted in law to send the case back on remand  for fresh hearing.    ",
      "11. Careful examination of the materials on  record shows that both the trial Court as well as the  appellate Court below has concurrently found on  proper and adequate consideration and discussion of  evidence and materials on record that the Kabala  deed dated 19-10-1955, Exhibit-1, which confers  title on the plaintiffs in respect of the suit land has  been proved to be genuine and valid. Both the trial  as well as the appellate Court below concurrently  found on due consideration of the evidence and  materials on record that the registered Kabuliats and  patta, Exhibit Ka series and Kha, were not acted  upon. Further the Courts below also concurrently  found that the said partition deed dated 24-3-1956,  Exhibit-Ga, did not make any mention about the  aid partition aforesaid Kabuliats and patta and the  deed having not been executed and registered by the  father of the plaintiffs Mohammad Mia and mother  of the plaintiffs Khairunnessa, defendant No. 1, the  same was not binding on the plaintiffs and in this  view of the matter non-consideration of the solena-  ma by the appellate Court below did not vitiate the  finding of the trial Court as well as the appellate  Court below that the Kabuliats and patta were not  acted upon and the said Kabala deed dated 19-10-  1955 was genuine and it transferred title to  Mohammad Mia and Khairunnessa, father and  mother respectively of the plaintiffs.    ",
      "10. We have heard Mr AJ Mohammad Ali, the  jearned Counsel for the appellants and Mr  Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, the learned  Counsel for respondent Nos. 1-2, 4, 13, 15-16, 18,  22 and 24 and perused the judgment of the High  Court Division and other connected papers. Mr  Mohammad Ali contends that since the trial Court as  well as the appellate Court below have decided all  the issues involved in the case on the basis of evi-  dence on record the impugned judgment for remand  by the High Court Division is uncalled for and, as  such, not tenable in law. Mr Ahmed on the other  hand while supporting the impugned order of  remand submits that since complicated question of  title is involved the High Court Division acted in  accordance with law in remanding the case for being  tried also as a suit for declaration of title after  required amendment of the plant.    ",
      "9. Leave was granted to consider whether  remand of the suit for fresh trial as a suit for declaration                  of title and partition for the reasons stated  above is sustainable in law when there is concurrent  finding of fact by the trial Court as well as the appel-  Jate Court below on the basis of materials on record  that the Kabala deed dated 19-10-1955 in favour of  the plaintifls was proved to be genuine but the reg-  jstered Kabuliats and patta were not acted upon and  the father of the plaintiffs Mohammad Mia was not  a party to the partition deed, Exhibit-Ga and the  defendant No. 1, mother of the plaintiffs, refused  registration of the partition deed.    ",
      "8. The learned Judges of the High Court  Division remanded the suit for a fresh trial purport-  edly on the ground that the suit involves complical-  ed question of title as the Kabala deed dated 19-10-  1995 was disputed by the defendants and in view of  the findings of the appellate Court below as regards  the registered Kabuliats and patta vitiated for non-  consideration of the solenama, Exhibit-Gha, filed in  the Criminal Case No. 1323 of 1995.    ",
      "7. The defendants being aggrieved by the afore-  said judgment and decree preferred Civil Revision  No. 1788 of 1997 before the High Court Division  whereupon a Division Bench by the impugned judg-  ment and order dated 18-2-2002 set aside the said  judgment and decree of the appellate Court below  and sent the case back on remand to the trial Court  for fresh trial of the suit as a suit for declaration of  title and partition by allowing the plaintiffs to amend  the plaint accordingly giving a chance to the defen-  dants to file additional written statement if they so  require.    ",
      "6. Against the said decree the defendant-pet-  tioners preferred Title Appeal No. 13 of 1995 in the  Court of District Judge Chandpur, who by its judy.  ment and decree dated 19-11-1996 dismissed the  appeal on contest with the concurrent finding thay  Mohammad Mia is not a party to the Partition deed  Exhibit 'Ga', and defendant No. 1, Khairunnessa  having refused registration of the partition Exhibit  ‘Ga’ the same is not binding upon the plaintiffs. The  learned District Judge further found that the kabala  deed dated 19-10-1955, Exhibit 1, being executed  and registered earlier Mohammad Mia and defen-  dant No. 1 Khairunnessa became the co-sharer in the  suit jote but Mohammad Mia being a co-sharer has  not been made a party to the partition deed dated 24-  3-1956 intentionally and, as such, the partition deed  is not binding upon the plaintiffs.    ",
      "5. The trial Court decreed the suit in prelimi-  nary form by judgment and order dated 30-11-1994    giving saham of 15%, acres of land to the plaintiffs  and a saham of 95'/, acres of land to the defendant  No. 1.    ",
      "4. The defendant-respondent Nos. 2, 3, 5-20,  22-53, 55, 57 and S8 contested the suit by filing joint  written statement denying the material allegations  made in the plaint contending, inrer alia, that the  suit for partition is not maintainable and it is bad for  defect of parties and for not bringing the joint prop-  erty into hotchpotch of the suit. Their case is that  Torab Ali, the original owner of the suit land, had  some other lands besides the suit land. Torab Ali  married two wives and had 6 sons one daughter by  his first wife and two daughters by his second wife.  Torab Ali gifted some lands to his grand sons and  transferred the remaining land of the suit Khatian to  his 5 sons Ali Ahmed, Mohammad Mia, Abdul  Halim, Abdul Gani and Abdul Kader by different  registered Kabuliats and patta dated 2-8-1951, 27-5-  1951, 29-7-1951 and 15-9-1953 and thus exhausted  his interest in the suit Khatian. Exhibit-1 the kabala  deed dated 19-10-1955, was executed by false per-  sonification when Torab Ali was not alive. Since  Torab Ali had no interest left in the suit Khatian  Mohammad Mia and Khairunnessa acquired no title  and possession in the aforesaid 0.36 acres of land by  virtue of the said kabala deed dated 19-10-1955.  Subsequent to the said Kabala deed there arose  some dispute among the heirs of Torab Ali as  regards possession of the properties left by Torab  Ali. Hence Hazera Banu, second wife of Torab Ali,  filed a Criminal Case No. 1323 of 1955 in the Court  of the Magistrate, 2nd Class and during pendency of  the criminal case lands left by Torab Ali were parti-  tioned among his wife, sons and daughters amicably  and a partition deed was executed and registered on  24-3-1956 . Mohammad Mia and defendant No. |  Khairunnessa never produced the same before or at  the time of execution of the partition deed Exhibit  \"Ga\". Since a complicated question of title is  involved the instant simple suit for partition is not  maintainable without ay prayer for declaration of  title.    ",
      "3. Defendant No. 1, mother of the plaintills,  filed an application praying for her saham to the  extent of 0.96 acres excluding 0.36 acres as purchased                  by her and her husband Mohammad Mia out  of 6.56 acres of the Suit Khatian,    ",
      "2. <br>  Md Joynul Abedin J: This appeal by leave by he  plaintiffs is directed against the judgment and order  dated }8-2-2002 passed by the High Court Division    in Civil Revision No. 1788 of 1997 making the rule  ecient ANSE ce  *Civil Appeal No. 136 of 2003.    (From the judgment and order dated 18-2-2002    Passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.  1788 of 1997)    absolute upon setting aside the judgment and decree  dated 19-11-1996 passed in Title Appeal No. 13 of  1995 by the learned District Judge, Chandpur,  affirming those dated 30-11-1994 ed in Partition  Suit No. 113 of 1994 by the learned Subordinate  Judge, 2nd Court, Chandpur, decreeing the same.  <br>   The appellant Nos. 1-3 and respondent No.  56 as plaintiffs instituted the aforesaid Partition Suit  No. 113 of 1994 for partition alleging that the suit  land measuring 0.36 acres of CS Khatian No. 341,  SA Khatian No. 347 of Mouza 418 Kherighar for-  merly within PS Hajiganj now Shaharasti originally  belonged to Torab Ali. Torab Ali had two wives. By  his first wife he had six sons and a daughter and by  his second wife he had two daughters, Khairunnessa  defendant No. | and Jibonnessa defendant No. 2.  Defendant No. 1 Khairunnessa was married to  Mohammad Mia and both of them resided and lived  with Torab Ali in his house. Torab Ali, during his  lifetime, sold 0.36 acres of land, out of suit plot No.  1661 with a \"Chouchala\" tin hut thereon to defen-  dant No. | Khairunnessa and Mohammad Mia by  registered Kabala dated 19-10-1955 and delivered  possession to them. During SA operation this 0.36  acres of land of suit plot No. 1661 was recorded in  the name of Mohammad Mia and his wife defendant  No. 1 Khairunnessa and they paid rents for the said  land. Mohammad Mia while in possession thereof  died leaving behind his widow defendant No. |  Khairunnessa and the plaintiff Nos. 1-4 as his sons  and daughters. Defendant No. | Khairunnessa  inherited 0.02 acre of land out of 0.18 acre of land  left by her husband Mohammad Mia and the plain-  tiffs 1-4 inherited the remaining 0.15'/, acres of land  left by Mohammad Mia. The plaintiffs are in pos-  session of their share in the suit property. Since  metes and bounds among the co-sharers the suit  property has not been partitioned by the plaintitYs  requested the co-sharer defendants to partition the  suit property but they refused. Hence the plaintiffs  filed the aforesaid suit for partition.    "

      "11. In the case of AKM Abdul Hye, (Supra) the  High Court Division was of the view that the pre-  sumption of correctness as to the entry of SA and RS  record finally published under section 19(3) in  Chapter IV has no basis. The Appellate Div  found those observations were not correct and  observed that :    \"presumption so attached under section  144A of the Act to the khatian prepared under  section 144 of the Act is rebuttable and the  respondents No. 1 and 2 has (sic) rebutted the  correctness of the entry made therein as regard  the name of Durga Charan Mondal’s son and  name of Gonesh Chandra Mondal son of Joy  Gopal Mondal and, as such, the finding of the  High Court Division that the presumption of  correctness as regard the entries in the RS kha-  tian is not available, is not correct.\"    This case is also distinguishable and has no manner  of application in the facts of the given case. There  is no presumptive value in SA khatian, and the  defendants cannot base their title on the basis of  recording of the lands in their names in SA khatian.    ",
      "10. In the case of Erfan Ali (Supra) this Court  observed “this view is erroneous, for rent receipts,  though not documents of title, are important item of  evidence of possession and may be used as collater-  al evidence of title since possession generally fol-  Jows title\" We do not dispute the statement of law  made on interpretation of rent receipts but the facts  of his case are quire distinguishable from the facts  of that case. In that case the plaintiff claimed that  Kali Charan purchased suit plot Nos. 25 and 27, got  his name mutated in the land lords sherista and paid  rent accordingly, and thereafter, he purchased from  the attomey and after purchase, he constructed huts  and inducted the defendant No, | as monthly tenant,  In support of his claim he filed some rent receipts.  The learned District Judge excluded these rent  receipts from consideration taking the view that they  did not relate to the suit plots. The High Court  Division disagreed with the views and observed that  unless the tenants name was recorded in the rent roll  by mutation, he could not pay rent, that though plot  numbers were not mentioned in the receipts other  particulars including exact amount of rent were  specifically mentioned there and that this fact estab-  lished connection between them and the lot in ques-  tion. The High Court Division further observed that  no rent was paid by Shashi Bhushan or his wife, the  owner of plot No. 25 at any time before the State  Acquisition came into force, that thereafter the rent  for the said lands were paid by one Pati Ram, the  defendant No. 2 son of Kalicharan and since the  plaintiffs purchased in 1951, he has been paying  rent, the rent receipts were excluded from consider-  ation by the lower appellate Court taking the view  that these are provisional receipts and that they carry  litle weight. The Appellate Division discarded this  view as erroneous. In this case the trial Court clear-  ly found that DW 1 failed to prove the rent receipts  Exhibit A series on the reasoning that he had no  knowledge about the payment of rent and that these  receipts were ante dated created for the purpose of  the suit. This finding was affirmed by the Court of  appeal below but the High Court Division did not  consider those findings.    ",
      "9. It was urged on behalf of the respondents that  the learned Judge of the High Court Division is per-  fectly justified in interfering with the judgments of  Courts below, inasmuch as, the Courts below had  illegally disbelieved the title of the defendant Nos.  1-8 and 12, in failing to consider that the SA khatian  has been prepared in their names and they have also  filed rent receipts which can be used or collateral  evidence of possession. In support of his contention  the learned counsel has referred the cases of Exfiu!  Ali vs Jainul Abedin Mia 35 DLR (AD) 216 and                  Government of Bangladesh vs AKM Abdul Hye 9  MLR (AD) 82 = 56 DLR (AD) 53    ",
      "8. These findings of the Courts below are based  upon proper appreciation of the evidence on record,  The learned Single Judge of the High Court  Division did not reverse those findings and abruptly  made the Rule absolute on the reasoning that both  the Courts below had committed error of law in not  considering and appreciating the material evidence  led by the defendants. The learned Single Judge did  not point out what material evidence were not con-  sidered by the Court of appeal below, other than  Exhibits A series and B. In respect of these Exhibits,  the Courts below discarded them as collusive docu-  ments created by the defendants for the purpose of  the suit and this finding of fact is binding on the  learned Judge of the High Court Division but the  learned Judge believed them as genuine documents  without discarding the findings of the Court below  and also without assigning any reason whatsoever.    ",
      "7. The Court of appeal below reassessed the  evidence on record and held that the defendants  failed to produce any documentary evidence in Sup-  port of the auction sale, that the defendants also  failed to prove that the auction purchasers got deliy-  ery of possession in pursuance of Rent Execution  Case No. 2100 of 1937, that the defendants also  failed to prove the settlement of the lands from the  land lord by calling the counter fail from the land  lord's sherista, that the auction sale was collusive  and on the basis of which, the defendants did not  acquire any title and that the plaintiffs have acquired  title on the basis of taking settlement from the auc-  tion purchasers.    ",
      "6. We have perused the judgment of the Courts  below and heard the learned counsels at length, The  trial Court observed that the defendants initially did  not mention about the auction sale of the suit lands  for arrears of rent in their original written statement  but subsequently by way of amendment on 13th  August, 1995 introduced those facts. It was further  observed that the defendants also filed an applica-  tion on 9th March, 1993 stating that the sale certifi-  cate was lost and as the volume book was torn up,  they failed to procure the certified copy of the same.  The trial Court noticed that the defendants subse-  quently filed Exhibit B, the certified copy of the sale  certificate said have been obtained on 17th May,  1994, but in the said sale certificate nothing was  mentioned that the original volume book was torn.  In the premises, the defendants ought to have proved  Exhibit B by calling for the original volume book  but they failed to prove the same. Fazlur Rahman  (DW 1) in course of his cross-examination stated  that he had no personal knowledge about the auction  purchase and that he made inconsistent statement  about the auction sale. The defendants did not  adduce any evidence in support of delivery of pos-  session. The trial Court held that Mokai Mondal  (DW 7) made inconsistent statements regarding pos-  session, inasmuch as, he stated that the auction sale  was held about 33 years ago but on the other breath,  he stated that it was held about 58 years ago. The  trial Court further observed that the Exhibit A series  did not relate to the lands in CS khatian No. 77 and  over and above, those rent receipts were not sup-  posed to be kept in the possession of the defendents,  which are ante dated documents, that the defendants  have miserably failed that the lands in CS khatian  have been sold for arrears of rent and that the land  lord has purchased the same and thereafter, the land  lord has settled the same to the sons of Ali Hossain.    ",
      "5. It is urged on behalf of the appellants that the  learned Judge of the High Court Division erred in  law in interfering with the concurrent findings of the  Courts below in failing to consider that the Court  below on a proper appreciation of the evidence on  record have arrived at the finding that the defendant  Nos. 1-8 and 12 have failed to prove their claim of  auction purchase by adducing documentary evi-  dence and also without reversing those findings of  facts. It was further urged that the learned Judge of                    the High Court Division fell in an error in failing to  consider that Exhibit A series, the rent receipts do  not relate to the lands in CS khatian No. 77 and  Exhibit B the sale certificate has not been proved  and that the said Exhibit B has not acted upon in the  absence of delivery of possession.    ",
      "4. The trial Court on consideration of the evi-  dence on record found the plaintiffs title and posses-  sion in respect of 1.94 acres of land and allotted  them saham of the said portion of lands. The trial  Court also allotted saham of 8 annas share in the  lands in CS khatian No. 77 to the defendant Nos. 24-  36 and 38 on the findings inter alia that they were  the owners of the lands on the basis of adverse pos-  session and certificate sale. The defendant Nos. 1-8  and 12 being aggrieved by the said judgment and  order preferred Title Appeal No. 79 of 1996; the  leamed Additional District Judge, Ist Court,  Jhenaidah who heard the said appeal by judgment  and order dated 12th April, 2001 maintained the  judgment and decree of the trial Court. The said  defendents thereupon moved the High Court  Division in Civil Revision No. 3001 of 2000 . A  Single Bench of the High Court Division upon hear-  ing the parties by judgment and order dated 21st  June, 2005 made the rule absolute and set aside  those of the Courts below. The learned Single Judge  observed that both the Courts below committed  error of law in failing to consider the material evi-  dence led by the defendants with regard to the cer-  tificate sale and the rent receipts Exhibit A series and  the sale certificate, Exhibit B and that the plaintiffs  failed to prove their title but the Courts below with-  out considering those exhibits disbelieved the  defendant's case.    ",
      "3. Defendant Nos. 1-8 and 12 contested the suit  by filing a joint written statement. Their case is that  they exclusively owned and acquired title by  adverse possession of the suit lands. A portion of the  suit land appertaining to CS khatian No. 77 was pur-  chased in auction by the land lord in Rent Execution  Case No. 2100 of 1997, who thereupon settled the  said lands with Omed Ali and Samed Ali, the prede-  cessors-in-interest defendants No. 1-8 and 12 and  since then they had possessed the same and after  their death the defendants have been enjoying the  said lands by paying rent. The defendants No, 24-36  and 38 who were the heirs of Mobarak Mondal and  Ebad Mondal also filed a joint written statement  praying for separate saham by way of inheritance  denying the claim of the defendant Nos. 1-8 and 12.  ‘Their case is that they are owners of the lands in CS  khatian No, 77 by way of settlement from the land-  lord and have possessed the same.    ",
      "2. The respondent Nos. 15-32 instituted the suit  for partition on the averments that the suit lands  appertain to CS khatian Nos. 18, 77, 133 and 138  belonged to Hossain Biswas, Ebad Ali Mondal,  Sobhan Mondal, Khorshed Mondal, Jamat Ali  Mondal and Hamid Mondal who were predecessor-  in-interest of the plaintiffs-respondents and defend-  ents-appellants. The plaintiffs are in ejmali posses-  sion of the suit lands with the defendants during the  settlement operation. The plaintiffs entrusted Omed  Ali and Karam Ali to get the suit lands recorded in  their names jointly with the defendants but they, in  utter violation of such direction got the suit lands  recorded in the names of the defendants. Despite  such wrong recording the plaintiffs have been  enjoying the suit lands in ejmali with the defendants  without any interference but some times before the  date of institution of the suit, the defendants have  tried to establish their title in the entire suit lands  denying the plaintiffs title.    ",
      "1. SK Sinha J : This appeal at the instance of the  defendant Nos. 24-36 and 38 is by leave granted by  this Court against the judgment and order dated 2st  June, 2005 of a Single Bench of the High Court    *Civil Appeal No. 122 of 2006.    (From the judgment and order dated 21st June, 2006  passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.  3001 of 2001).                  Division in Civil Revision No. 3001 of 2001 making  the Rule absolute and reversing those dated 12th  April, 2001 of the Additional District Judge, 1st  Court, Jhenaidah in Title Appeal No. 79 of 1996  affirming those dated 27th April, 1996 of the Senior  Assistant Judge, Kaligonj, Jhenaidah in Title Suit  No. 14 of 1996 decreeing the suit and allotting  saham of 1,94 acres of land out of the suit lands to  the plaintiffs and half portion of lands of CS khatian  No. 77 to the defendant Nos. 24-36 and 38.

      "25. In view of the aforesaid observation in  Criminal Appeal Nos. 5 and 6 of 2008 and the fact  the petitioner in the Criminal Petition for Leave to  Appeal No. 146 of 2008 being seriously ill and as  the statements made in the application not to stay  the order of the High Court Division granting bail as  well as the submissions made by the learned  Counsel of the petitioner in the Criminal Petition for  Leave to Appeal that the petitioner is a cancer  patient being not disputed from the side of the State  and that the period of sentence being 3(three) years  simple imprisonment we are of the view, that the  petitioner's prayer to allow her to enjoy the privilege  of bail granted by the High Court Division in Writ  Petition No. 9600 of 2007 merits consideration. In  the afore-state of the matter in our opinion no pur-  pose would be served in granting leave as against  the order of the High Court Division dated October  1, 2007 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 3990 of 2007  in rejecting the prayer for bail and that ends of jus-  tice would be served in disposing of the Criminal  Petition for Leave to Appeal upon allowing the peti-  tioner to enjoy the privilege of bail which she is  enjoying un-interruptedly from January 7, 2008 (as  evident from the bail bond at page 16 of the appli-  cation filed by the petitioner to allow her to enjoy  the privilege of bail).  Accordingly, Criminal Petition for Leave to  Appeal No. 146 of 2008 is disposed of upon setting  aside the order of the High Court Division dated  October 1, 2007 rejecting the prayer for bail as  regard the petitioner in Criminal Petition for Leave  to Appeal No. 146 of 2008, The petitioner is  allowed to enjoy the privilege of bail which she is  enjoying since being released upon execution of bail  bond on 7th January, 2008 and shall continue to be  on bail till disposal of the Criminal Appeal No. 3999  of 2007 pending for hearing before the High Court  Division. The petitioner in Criminal Petition for  Leave to Appeal No. 146 of 2008 would not be  required to execute fresh bail bond and shall enjoy  the privilege of bail on the basis of the bail bond  executed in the light of the order of the High Court  Division in Writ Petition No. 9600 of 2007 granting  bail and thereupon has been released.

      "24. The matter of granting bail by the |  Court Division, during the period of emergency, in a  pending appeal filed by the convict who has been  convicted and sentenced by the Special Court under  the provision of Anti-Corruption Act, 1957 or that as  per the provision of Anti-Corruption Commission  Act, 2004 as well as under the provision of Penal  Code in the background of the provision of Rule  11(3) of the Emergency Power Rules, 2007 came up  for consideration in Criminal appeal Nos. 5 and 6 of                    2008 and therein this Court has observed \"the appel-  late Court, in case of short sentence not exceeding 3  years, when the appeal could not be disposed of  within 90 working days for no fault of the appe  and/or in the case of serious illness endangering life  to be certified by duly constituted Medical Board,  may consider the matter of granting bail in an appro-  priate case in an appeal\".    ",
      "23. As it has already been mentioned hereinbe-  fore that the petitioner is seriously ill being a cancer  patient and that she has been sentenced to:sutiers 3  (three) years simple imprisonment on June 21, 2007  and as against that she has filed an appeal i.e.  Criminal Appeal No. 3990 of 2007 . It may also be  mentioned that while granting leave as against the  ad-interim order dated 9-12-2007 of the High Court  Division in Writ Petition No. 9600 of 2007 granting  bail to the petitioner in the Criminal Petition for  Leave to Appeal i.e. Respondent No. | in the Civil  Appeal No. 36 of 2008 this Court did not stay the  order of the High Court Division granting ad-inter-  im bail to the petitioner since prior to that date she  was released on bail upon execution of bail bond  and that also seriously ill being a cancer patient.    ",
      "22. We have heard the learned Counsel appear-  ing for the petitioner in the Criminal Petition for  Leave to Appeal and also have heard the learned  Additional Attorney-General.    ",
      "21. The Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal  No. 146 of 2008 has been filed as the order  of the High Court Division dated October 1, 2007  passed by Criminal Appeal No. 3990 of 2007 rejeet-  ing the prayer for bail of the petitioner. It appears the  same is barred by 190 days. An application s  condonation of delay has been filed. W  perused the said application for condonation of  delay and have heard the learned Counsels of the  parties. On perusal of the statements made in the  petition secking condonation of delay, it is seen that  the period of delay in filing the Criminal Petition for  Leave to Appeal has sufficiently been explained and  the explanation so offered merits consideration. In  that view of the matter delay in filing the Criminal  Petition for Leave to Appeal is condoned.    ",
      "20. Since the appeal in the background of the  facts and circumstances of the case has become  infructuous or in other words no useful purpose  would be served in proceeding with the appeal the  same is dismissed with the aforesaid observation.  ‘There is no order as to costs.    ",
      "19. As we have earlier said that the respondent  No. 1 in the appeal, i.e. the petitioner in the writ  petition having had not the desired result i.e. bail till  final hearing of the criminal appeal the tadbirker of  the respondent No. 1 resorted to the course, i.e.  moving the High Court Division in writ jurisdiction,  as it appears, primarily for enlargement of the writ  petitioner on bail, although the course resorted to  was in no Way appreciable rather the writ petition so  filed was a queer resort or in other words to have the  desired result through a resort which is totally dif=  ferent from the practice and the course prescribed by  the procedure of the Court. The resort so made is in  no way appreciable rather the course so pursued is  seriously depreciable. In the totality of the facts and  circumstances of the matter, i.e. filing of writ peti-  tion primarily to get the writ petitioner enlarged on  bail, it is quite evident that action of the tadbirker of  the writ petitioner was indiscreet one and such resort  is highly depreciable. Any one resorting to queer  practice in a Court of law and that resort so made as  have no sanction of practice and procedure of the  Coun is liable to be brought within the net of law  and to be dealt with in accordance with law, Had the  writ petitioner been not seriously ill being a cancer  patient, the result obtained upon resorting to the pro-  cedure in question would not have allowed enjoy.  We are of the opinion that for the indiscreet act of  the tadbirker the writ petitioner should not suffer.    ",
      "18. It was noticed that the writ petition was  filed having had not the desired result i.e, bail, in the                  criminal appeal which was filed against the judg  ment and order of the Special Court convicting and  the respondent No. 1 in the appeal for  rs simple imprisonment. The resort so  made was in no way appreciable one from any angle  of the practice and procedure of this Court i.e.  supreme Court of Bangladesh.    ",
      "17. In the background of the aforesaid submis-  sion of the learned Additional Attorney-General  there was no necessity of proceeding with the appeal  and accordingly the same is dismissed.    ",
      "16. In that state of the matter, we called upon  the learned Additional Attorney-General as to  whether any useful purpose would be served in pro-  ceeding with hearing of the appeal and thereupon  the learned Additional Attorney-General submitted  since the Rule obtained in the Writ Petition No.  9600 of 2007 has already been discharged for non-  prosecution and the ad-interim order passed therein  has also been recalled and vacated the appeal filed  as against the order dated December 9,2007 passed  in Writ Petition No. 9600 of 2007 has lost its effica-  cy and that no useful purpose would be served in  proceeding with the appeal.    ",
      "15. When the appeal was taken up for hearing  the learned Counsel for the petitioner in Criminal  Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 146 of 2008 sub-  mitted that the writ petitioner filed an application  before the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.  9600 of 2007 for discharging the Rule obtained  therein for non-prosecution and the High Court  Division upon allowing the application has dis-  charged the Rule obtained in the aforementioned  writ petition for non-prosecution and that re-called  and vacated the ad-interim order passed by the High  Court Division in the writ petition.    ",
      "14. The Appeal came up for hearing along with  the Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal on 17-4.  2008 . The Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal  has been filed against the order of the High Court  Division dated October 1, 2007 rejecting the prayer  for bail in Criminal Appeal No. 39990 of 2007.    ",
      "13. At the time of hearing of the Civil Petition  for Leave to Appeal No. 49 of 2008 the learned  Counsel for the respondent No. | having had real-  ized the irregularity in the matter of filing the writ  petition after being having not the relief of bail and  obtaining ad-interim bail in respect of the respon-  dent No, 1 submitted that the writ petitioner i.e.  respondent No. | in the Civil Petition for Leave to  Appeal would file appeal with the prayer for condo-  nation of delay as against the order of the High  Court Division dated October 1, 2008 passed in  Criminal Appeal No. 3990 of 2007 refusing the  prayer for bail and that as the respondent No. | has  already been released in the light of the order passed  by the High Court Division in the writ petition and    that as she is seriously ill being a cancer patient the  order of the High Court Division granting bail may  not be stayed and that she may be allowed to enjoy  the privilege of bail upon being already released in  the light of the order of the High Court Division,    ",
      "12. As it appears from the application filed by  the respondent No. 1 in the Civil Petition for Leave  to Appeal that while the said Petition for Leave to  Appeal was pending for hearing the respondent No.  1 was released on bail upon accepting her bail bond.    ",
      "11. The respondent No. | in the petition for  leave to appeal filed an application with the prayer  for not to stay the order of the High Court Division  granting ad-interim bail.    ",
      "10. As against the ad-interim order of the High  Court Division the respondent No. | in the writ peti-  tion ic. Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary,  Ministry of Home Affairs filed Civil Petition for  Leave to Appeal, being No. 49 of 2008 . The said  Petition for Leave to Appeal came up for hearing  before the Court on January 13, 2008 and upon hear-  ing the learned Additional Attorney-General as well  as the learned Counsel entering Caveat for respon-  dent No. | i.e. writ petitioner this Court granted  leave to appeal to consider the submissions of the  learned Additional Attorney-General that the writ  petitioner convicted under section 27(1) of the Anti-  Corruption Commission Act, 2004 read with section  109 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to simple  imprisonment for 3(three) years in Special Case No.                  1 of 2007 and as against the said judgment and order  in the special case the writ petitioner having had  filed appeal, being Criminal Appeal No, 3990 of  2007, before the High Court Division and in the said  appeal an application for bail was filed and the same  ed, that the appeal is pending and there is  a specific procedure for filing appeal and disposing  the same and, as such, the impugned order of the  High Court Division passed in the writ petition is  bad in law and the same is liable to be set aside. It  was also submitted by the learned Additional  Attorney-General that the writ petitioner having had  filed criminal appeal and having had sought particu-  lar remedy, her filing of the writ petition for getting  self-same remedy instead of moving higher Court,  the writ petition was not maintainable and, as such,  the order sought to be appealed is bad in law and the  same is liable to be set aside. This Court granted  leave to consider the aforesaid submissions of the  learned Additional Attorney-General.    ",
      "9. The High Court Division by the order  dated December 9, 2007 issued Rule in the writ peti-  tion so filed and granted ad-interim bail to the writ  petitioner \"pending disposal of the Rule or until fur-  ther order, as the case may be......... a    ",
      "8. The writ petition, being Writ Petition No.  9600 of 2007, was filed with the prayer \"Issue a  Rule Nisi calling upon the Respondents to show  cause as to why the Rule 11(3) of the Emergency  Rules and section 28Ka of the Anti-Corruption  Commission Act, 2004 should not be declared  inconsistent with the Article 7(2) and 35 of the con-  stitution and as to why the petitioner Sabera Aman  should not be enlarged on bail in Kafrul Police  Station Case No. 15(3) of 2007 dated 6-3-2007  which has been registered as Special Case No. | of  2007 and convicted under sections 27(1) of the Anti-  Corruption Commission Act, 2004 read with section  109 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer sim-  ple imprisonment for 3(three) years in Special Case  No. 1 of 2007\" and also prayed for enlarging the  writ petitioner i.e. the petitioner in the Criminal  Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 146 of 2008 on ad-  interim bail.    ",
      "7. It appears that the respondent No. | having  had not been released i.e. not being enlarged on bail  during the pendency of the criminal appeal filed by  her against the judgment and order of the Court of  Special Judge, her tadbirker moved the High Court  division in writ jurisdiction seeking reliefs, includ-  ing bail till final disposal of the Criminal Appeal No.  3990 of 2007.    ",
      "6. As against the judgment and order of the  Court of Special Judge the respondent No. 1 in the  Appeal, who is also the petitioner in the Petition,  filed Criminal Appeal No. 3990 of 2007 before the  High Court Division. The appeal so filed came up  for admission hearing and the High Court Division  admitted the appeal for final hearing by the order  dated October 1, 2007 and also stayed realisation of  fine tll disposal of the appeal. On that day an appli-  cation with a prayer for bail was filed before the  High Court Division and the said Division upon  referring to the provision of Rule 11(3) of the  Emergency Power Rules, 2007 rejected the prayer  for bail and that also rejected the prayer for staying  the judgment of the Special Court confiscating the  property of the respondent No. |.    ",
      "5. It may be mentioned the respondent No. 1  in the Appeal, who is also the petitioner in the  Petition, was not found guilty of the charge under  section 26(2) of the Anti-Corruption Commission  Act, 2004 and Rule 15 Gha(5) of the Emergency  Power Rules, 2007 read with section 109 of the  Penal Code and thereupon was acquitted of the said  charge.    ",
      "4. On conclusion of the trial the Special tribu-  nal found guilty the respondent No. 1 in the Appeal,  who is also the petitioner in the Petition, under sec-  tion 27(1) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act,  2004 read with section 109 of the Penal Code and  has been convicted thereunder and sentenced her to  suffer simple imprisonment for 3(three) years    ",
      "3. The respondent No. | in the Appeal and the  petitioner in the Petition was put on trial to answer                  the charge under section 26(2) of the Anti-  Corruption Commission Act, 2004 and Rule 15  Gha(5) of the Emergency Power Rules, 2007 read  with section 109 of the Penal Code and also the  charge framed under section 27(1) of the Anti-  Corruption Commission Act, 2004 read with section  109 of the Penal Code.    ",
      "2. The facts of the case of the Civil Appeal  and the Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal need  not be stated in detail since the same is not so much  so necessary for the disposal of the Appeal and the  Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal (the petition).  It is material to state that the respondent No, 1 in the  Appeal, who is the petitioner, was put on trial along  with another who is her husband.    ",
      "1. Md Ruhul Amin CJ: This Appeal and the  Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal were heard  together since the respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal  No. 36 of 2008 and the petitioner in Criminal  Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 146 of 2008 are  common and the matter in issue in the Appeal and  the Criminal Petition is also common i.e. granting of  the bail in the writ petition and rejection of the  prayer for bail in a pending Criminal Appeal No.  3990 of 2007 filed against the judgment and order  dated June 21, 2007 of the Court of Special Judge  No. 1, Dhaka in Special Case No. 1 of 2007 (arising  out of Kafrul PS Case No. 15 dated March 6, 2007  corresponding to ACC GR No. 12 of 2007).

      "21. In consideration of the decisions reported i  35 DLR (AD) 230 and 52 DLR (AD) 41 as above. we  are of the opinion that a final decree in a partition suit  for a registered deed of partition put an end to co-  sharership extinguishing his right of pre-emption.    ",
      "20. The decisions cited by Mr Bhuiyan, the  learned Counsel for the respondent does not apply in  the instant case.    ",
      "19. In the decision reported in 52 DLR (Ap),  41, their Lordships were of the view that passing ,;  final decree in partition suit implies that all the  directions in respect of distributing and separatin.  the Saham of the parties contained in the prelimi.  nary decree was complied with the nothing remain,  to be executed after the passing of the final decreg  and therefore it is wrong to imply that the fina  decree has to be executed for the separation of the  Saham land. Their Lordships were also of the view  that after passing of the final decree in partition suit,  it is effective between the admitted co-sharers and  for the purpose of a pre-emption proceeding were  the transfer is made by a co-sharer to a stranger. In  that view of the matter, the passing of the final  decree in a partition suit finally determines the right  of the co-sharers in the land. Hence, the application  for the pre-emptor-respondent on the basis of co-  sharership is not maintainable. Partition suit ending  ina final decree or an amicable partition of the prop-  erty among the admitted co-sharer through a regis-  tered deed of partition put an absolute end to co-  sharership for all practical purpose irrespective of  separation or splitting of land or Jama through  mutation proceeding.    ",
      "18. On perusal of the decisions cited by Mr  Islam, we find substance in his submissions that the  registered deed of partition is a complete transaction  of transfer of ownership and possession among the  co-sharers, which put an end to co-sharership. The  decision reported in 35 DLR (AD) 230 was a splited  judgment and the majority view lend support to Mr  Islam. The learned Single Judge of the High Court  Division relying on the minority view of the judg-  ment made the Rule absolute in Civil Revision  No.524 of 1998 and discharged the Rules issued in    Civil Revision Nos.614 and 615 of 1998 on an erro.  neous finding that a partition deed does not extin.  guish and cease co-sharership without splitting up oy  the Jama within the meaning of section 24 of Noy.

The registered partition deed vide  Annexure-A shows that the case land was amicably  partitioned among the co-sharers and they were put  to possession of the respective land allotted to them.  Both the preemptor and vendor are parties to the  said deed, Consequent upon such partition, the ven-  dor vide Exhibit-B sold the case land to the appel-  lant pursuant to an agreement vide Annexure-C,  None of the co-sharers challenged the said regis-  tered deed to partition. In the said deed vide  Annexure-A, the kabala vide Exhibit-B and the  agreement vide Exhibit-C have been incorporated.    ",
      "16. Substance of the submissions of Mr  Mahmudul Islam, the learned Counsel for the pre-  emptee-appellant is that a registered partition deed  or a final decree passed in a partition suit is a com-  plete transaction of transfer of ownership and pos-  session of the respective shares/shaham of the land  partitioned among the co-sharers and it finally  determines and cease co-sharership and is binding  on the co-sharers, who are parties to the same and  separation of Jama is not necessary to cease their co-  sharership in the land so partitioned and divided  among the co-sharers, On the contrary, according to  Mr Bhuiyan, the learned Counsel for the pre-emp-  tor-respondent, a registered deed of partition is a  document of peaceful possession in the respective  land of the co-sharers and not of change of owner-  ship of the land and an end to the status of co-shar-  ership unless and until Jama of the case land is split-  ed up and separated by mutation and it does not  extinguish the right of preemption of the pre-emptor  under section 24 of the NAT Act.    ",
      "15. The moot question in the case as argued by  the learned Counsels of both the parties is whether  either a registered partition deed or final decree in 2  Partition suit puts an end to the co-sharership in the  land so partitioned or whether the co-sharership  continuous till the same is separated and splited up  by separation of Jama through mutation.                  ",
      "14. There is no dispute that the case land  sought to be preempted by the preemptor-respon-  dent was amicably partitioned among the co-sharers  by the registered partition deed to which among  other co-sharers both the preemptor and the vendor-  Opposite-party No.2 were parties and the vendor-  Opposite-party No.2 sold it to the pre-emptee-appel-  lant by registered kabala after partition.    ",
      "13. We have heard the leamed Counsels of  both the sides, perused the impugned judgment of  the High Court Division and those of the lower  Courts and other materials available on record.    ",
      "1. On the other hand, Mr Abdul Wadud  Bhuiyan, the learned Senior Counsel appearing in  support of the impugned judgment for the pre-emp-  tor-respondent No.1, Vehemently opposed the  appeals controverting the submissions made by the  leamed Counsel for the appellant, contending that  mere existence of a registered deed of partition does  not extinguish the status of co-sharership unless and  until the Jama of the land is splited up and separat-  ed and that the partition deed in made only for the  convenience of possession of the co-sharers in the  case land and as such the judgment and order of the  High Court Division is sustainable in law. He con-  tinues that right of preemption under section 24 of  the Non-Agricultural and Tenancy Act is not lost  with the partition and co-sharership in the land  transferred does not cease due to registered deed of  partition amongst the co-sharers when there is no  splitting up of the holding and the Jama is not sepa-  rated by opening a new khatian pursuant to regis-  tered deed of partition and therefore, the interpreta-  tion given by the learned Single Judge of the High  Court Division on the right of pre-emptor under sec-  tion 24 of the Non-Agricultural and Tenancy Act is  correct and is in consonance with law. He also  argues that under section 24 of the Non-Agricultural  and Tenancy Act a co-sharer loses his co-sharership  in the tenancy or holding by separation of Jama  through mutation proceeding and the principle is  equally applicable in both the cases of Agricultural  and Non-Agricultural land and the High Court  Division has thus rightly passed the impugned judy-  ment and order. He contends that a final decree  passed in a partition suit for amicable partition sep  arates and divides the land for the purpose of pos-  session only, but does not ipso facto terminate co-  sharership in such land till subdivision of holdi  and distribution of rents takes place in accordance  with law, and as such, the respondent still continues  to remain as a co-sharer in the case land and is enti-  tled to exercise his right or preemption which has  rightly been held by the High Court Division cor-  rectly considering the Exhibits-A, B and C.    Mr Bhuiyan referred the cases of Md Mucaffiar  Khan vs Md Yusuf Khan reported in /] DLR (SC) 78,  the case of Brindaban Chandra Chowdhury vs Rezia  Begum reported in 16 DLR 77, Rokeya Begum vs Md  Nurul Absar reported in | ADC 247.    ",
      "9. Against the judgment and order of the High  Court Division, the pre-emptce-petitioner filed civil  petitions for leave to Appeal Nos.139-141 of 2005  before this Division and obtained leave to appeal in  all the petition on 3-7-2006 to consider the follow-  ing grounds +    \"The High Court Division failed to consid-  er that once the properties among co-sharers are  partitioned by a registered partition deed show.  ing possession in specific share, co-sharership  under section 24 of the NAT Act ceases ang  separation of tenancy is not necessary. The  High Court Division failed to consider Exhibit.  A (partition deed), Exhibit-B (impugned kabala)  and Exhibit-C (agreement for sale) wherein spe-  cific possession is shown with boundaries and  also failed to reverse the finding of the appellate  Court about partition. The High Court Division  failed to appreciate that co-sharership in a non-  agricultural land ceases on partition and did not  consider the concurrent finding that plot  No.5351 was partitioned amongst the co-sharers  and did not also consider that in the partition  deed the pre-emptor is a party to the document  and none of the co-sharers has challenged the  document incorporating the partition and thus  the High Court Division committed error of law  occasioning failure of justice.\"    Mr Mahmudul Islam, the learned Senior  Counsel, appearing for the appellant, argued that the  learned Single Judge of the High Court Division  failed to consider that once the land is partitioned  amicably and voluntarily by a registered partition  deed amongst co-sharers or by a final decree passed  in a partition suit showing specific share and pos-  session to all the co-sharers, co-sharership in the  land ceases for the purpose of preemption under sec-  tion 24 of NAT Act and it does not require separa-  tion of holding or splitting up of the Jama. He  argued that the learned Single Judge has committed  an error of law occasioning failure of justice in  reassessing the evidence disturbing concurrent find-  ing of fact of the Courts below about partition  between the co-sharers and also tailed to consider  Exhibit-A_ partition deed, Exhibit-B impugned                  kabala and exhibit-C agreement for sale and did not  reverse the concurrent finding of the Courts below  that Plot No.5351 was partitioned amongst the co-  sharers and the preemptor was a party to the parti-  tion deed and none of the co-sharers challenged the  same (Exhibit-A) which incorporates both the  agreement and the kabala deed showing separate  possession with boundary walls consequent upon  partition and as such the impugned judgment and  iable to be set aside. Mr Islam also argued  ion misunderstood and order is  that the High Court Division:  misconstrued the decision of the case of SM  Basiruddin vs Zahurul Islam Chowdhury reported in  35 DLR (AD) 230 and in the case of Md Muzaffar  Khan vs Md Yusuf Khan reported in /] DLR (SC) 78 .    19 . Mr Mahmudul Islam, the learned Counsel  for the appellant, relied upon the case-laws in the  case of SM Basiruddin vs Zahurul Islam Chowdhury  reported in 35 DLR (AD) 230 and Shafiuddin vs Md  Abdul Karim reported in 52 DLR (AD) 41.    ",
      "8. The learned Single Judge of the High Court  Division passed the impugned judgment holding  that mere existence of the partition deed ipso facto  does not cease co-sharership without splitting up of  the Jama within the meaning of section 24 of the  Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act.    ",
      "7. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with  the judgment and order of the lower appellate Court,  the pre-emptor and the pre-emptee moved the High  Court Division by filing aforesaid civil revisions  and obtained Rules. The learned Single Judge of the  High Court Division upon hearing the parties made  the Rule absolute obtained in Civil Revision No.524  of 1998 by the preemptor and discharged the Rules  obtained in Civil Revision Nos.614 and 615 of 1998  obtained by pre-emptee-appellant vide  impugned judgment and order dated 3-11-2004.      ",
      "6. Trial Court, on consideration of the evi-  dence, both oral and documentary, allowed the prayer  for preemption in part i.e. to the extent of '/, of the  land transferred. As against the judgment and order of  the trial Court, pre-emptor filed Miscellaneous Appeal  No.13 of 1987 and the pre-emptee filed cross objec-  tion No.31 of 1987 . the lower appellate Court dis-  missed the appeal as well as the cross objection.    ",
      "5. The prayer for preemption was resisted by  the pre-emptee-opposite-party No. 1-appellant, stat-  ing, infer alia, that pre-emptor is not a co-sharer of  the case land but a contiguous land owner, that land  of plot No.S351 was partitioned by a registered deed  of partition amongst all the co-sharers before the  impugned kabala dated 23-1-1983 and there has  been separation of the holding and the parties are in  enjoyment separately of their respective share by  constructing different structures having separate  boundaries, that father of the pre-emptee-purchaser  had been in possession of the demised land with  structures as a bharatia under the vendor, and he  (pre-emptee) made improvements spending Taka  20,457, that application under section 24 of the NAT  Act is not maintainable since the land was separated  by partition, that there was no change of possession  and the pre-emptee is in enjoyment of the property  as per earlier possession, etc.    ",
      "4. Facts, in short, are that the pre-emptor filed  the Miscellaneous Case, stating, infer alia, that plot  No.5351 appertaining to khatian No.1739 belonged  to Rajjab Ali Khan and he was survived by two sons,  one daughter and a widow, that widow of Rajjab Ali  Khan gifted her share to her daughter, that Ashman  Ali Khan, vendor opposite-party No.2, predecessor  of respondent Nos. 2-13, being one of the sons of  Rajjab Ali Khan, sold 380 sashasrangsha from plot  No.5351 to the pre-emptee-opposite-party No.|-  appellant by kabala dated 23-1-1983, that the pre-  emptor-respondent No.2 came to know about the  said transfer on 28-1-1983 and thereupon tiled the  application under section 24 of the Non-Agricultural  Tenancy Act seeking preemption of the land claim-  ing to be co-sharer by inheritance and that he is in  need of the case land and the structure standing  thereon, and the pre-emptee-purchaser is a stran,  to the case land, etc.                  ",
      "3. These appeals involve common question of  law and identical facts and having heard analogous-  ly are being disposed of by this common judgment.    ",
      "2. The Civil Revision No.524 of 199% was  filed by the pre-emptor and Civil Revision No.614  of 1998 and Civil Revision No.615 of 1998 were  filed by the pre-emptee against the judgment and  order dated 4-11-1997 passed in Miscellaneous  Appeal No.13 of 1987 filed by the preemptor and  the Cross Objection No.31 of 1987 filed by the pre-  emptee, dismissing the both by the Court of  Additional District Judge, Patuakhali and affirming  the judgment and order dated 27-1-1987 passed by  the learned Subordinate Judge (Now joint District  Judge), Patuakhali in Miscellaneous Case No.27 of  1983 allowing the same in part filed under section  24 of the Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act.    6 by leave arose    ",

      "25. In the afore state of the matter we are of the  view the High Court Division was in error in inter-  fering with the judgment of the appellate Court set-  ting aside the judgment of learned Arbitrator which  was passed in violation of the law relating to assess-  ment of the compensation as regard the buildings  and other structures made’ in the acquired land by a  Private Engineering Firm and making the report so  filed by the said Private Engineering Firm as the  basis for awarding ‘compensation as regard the  buildings and other structures in the acquired land.    ",
      "24. The observations, referred to by the learned  counsel for the respondents in the reported cases, in  our opinion in the background of the instant appeal  has hardly of any relevance to the question whether  the provision in Rule 8(3) of the Rules is mandatory  or directory since in the instant case the Court at the  first instance was required to make direction to the  Public Works Department to assess the compensa-  tion for the constructions made in the acquired land  by the owners and the Court was not powerless to  enforce the provision of law as in Rule 8(3) of the  Rules and the Court having had not gone for that,  and in the instead had allowed the prayer of the  owners of the acquired land for appointment of a  Private Engineering Firm for assessing the costs of  buildings and other structures in the acquired land,  the Court acted in a manner which had no sanction                  of law. We are of the view that when a party  approaches a Court for a direction as regard certain  matter, the Court would be required to look into as  for address is the matter as to whieh the prayer for direction has been sought and if there is any law the Court would certainly be required to act in accordance with the Jaw touching the matter as to which a party in the proceeding sought for direction from the Court.  In the instant case the Court having had not done so,  the action of the Court in allowing the prayer for  appointment of a Private Engineering Firm for  assessment of the buildings and other structures in  the acquired land acted in violation of the law and as  such the said action of the Court has no legal sanc-  tion. In our view acceptance of plea of Waiver or in  other words entertaining the plea of Waiver as  regard performance of public function as requires to  be done by the law on particular matter would be  disastrous to discipline in the performance of public  functions by the public functionaries and thereby  allowing anarchy in the performance of function by  public functionaries as per mandate of law or in due  compliance of law to whether there is any law providing.    ",
      "23. The learned counsel has also referred to the  case of Secretary, Ministry of Food, Food Division,  Government of Bangladesh vs MF Ltd reported in  44 DLR (AD) 166 and placed reliance on the fol-  lowing portion of the judgment.    \"In the Statutory Law of Craies, absolute or  mandatory enactments have been distinguished  from enactments which are mere directory or  enabling provisions; failure to comply with a  mandatory rule invalidates and action, whereas  failure to comply with a directory rule does not  invalidate an action.\"    ",
      "22. The learned Counsel for the respondents  has submitted that the provision in Rule 8(3) of the  Rules is directory and not being mandatory in  nature, non-compliance of the provision of the said  Rule did not affect the judgment of the learned  Arbitrator. In support of the aforesaid contention the    learned counsel has referred to the case of Aminul  Islam vs James Finlay and Co Lid. reported in 26  DLR (SC) 33 and placed reliance on the following  Portion of the judgment.    \"When a public duty is imposed and the  Statute requires that it shall be performed in a  certain manner, or within a certain time or  under other specified conditions, such prescrip-  tions may be regarded as intended to be diree-  tory only in cases when injustice or inconven-  ience to others who have to control over those  exercising the duty would result if such require-  ments where essential and imperative.\"    ",
      "21. The submission made upon referring to the  aforesaid part of the judgment in the reported case in  the background of the facts of the instant case is  hardly of any useful purpose for the respondents  because of the fact that when application was made  for appointment of a Private Engineering Firm for  assessment of compensation, the learned Arbitrator  instead of accepting the said prayer ought to have  taken steps for performance of the public duty by  the Government functionary as per provision of law  and he having had not done so we find no merit in  the submission of the learned counsel that Public  Works Department waved its right of assessing com-  pensation in respect of the construction made in the  acquired land. From the judgment of the learned  Arbitrator it is not seen that there was express or  implied conduction of the public functionary. In the  case of public functionary the question of waiver in  the performance of function required by law to be  performed is to be strictly construed and only in the  presence of positive conduct of public functionary  waiver as regard performance of public function is  to be fixed.    ",
      "20. It has been submitted on behalf of respon-  dents that there was no illegality in the action of the  learned Arbitrator in allowing the prayer for  appointment of a Private Engineering Firm for  assessment of compensation as regard the construc-  tions made in the acquired land by the petitioners in  the Arbitration case, since they approached the  Public Works Department but the said department  did not response to the request made for nent  of compensation of the buildings and other struc  tures in the acquired land. The learned counsel for  the respondents submitted that the appellants having  had not responded to the request of the respondents  for assessment of the compensation fo the buildings  and other structures in the acquired land thereby  they have waved their right as provides in Rule §(3)  of the Acquisition of Immovable Property Rules.  1983 (the Rules). In support of the said contention  the learned counsel has referred to the case of  Sayeda Mazada Khatun vs BSRS reported in 55 DLR                    (AD) 82 and placed reliance on the part of the judg-  ment relating to waiver and the came runs as    \"Waiver is the abandonment of a right and  is cither express or implied from conduct, A  person Who is entitled to the benefit of a stipu-  jation in a contract or of a statutory provision  may Waive it or allow the contract or transac  tion 10 proceed as though the stipulation or pro-  vision docs not exist, Waiver of this kind  depends upon consent and the fact that other  party has acted upon it is sufficient considera-  tion, Where the waiver is not express it may be  implied from conduct which is inconsistent  with the continuance of the right\".    ",
      "19. In our opinion the learned Arbitrator  instead of allowing the prayer for appointment of  Private Engineering firm for assessment of the costs  of the constructions made in the acquired land ought  to have directed the Public Works Department to do  the duty relating to the assessment of compensation  of the constructions made in the acquired land as per  requirement of the law. The learned Arbitrator hav-  ing had not done so, his action in allowing the  prayer for appointment of a Private Engineering  Firm on the prayer of the petitioners in the  Arbitration Miscellaneous case for assessment of  the compensation as regard the constructions made  in the acquired land was not legal, rather was clear  violation of the law and as such the report relating to  costs of the constructions made in the acquired and  filed by the Private Engineering Firm ought not to  have been taken into consideration by the learned  Arbitrator and he having had taken into considera-  tion the said unauthorized report of the Private  Engineering Firm in assessing the costs of construc-  tions in the acquired land in awarding costs for con-  struction, the appellate Court was quite correct in  setting aside the judgment of the learned Arbitrator  and sending the case back on remand for fresh trial,    ",
      "18. It appears from the judgment of the learned  Arbitrator that it was submitted from the side of the  petitioners in the Arbitration Miscellaneous case  that they approached the Executive Engineer, Public  Works Department for assessment of compensation  of the construction in the acquired land, but there  was no response from the side of the requisitioning  authority or for that matter Public Works  Department and thereupon they applied to the  learned Arbitrator for appointment of the Private  Engineering Firm for ascertaining costs of the con-  structions made in the acquired land and the said  prayer was allowed. The Private Engineering Firm  so appointed submitted its report relating to costs of  constructions made in the acquired land and upon  accepting the said report the learned Arbitrator  awarded cost for construction.    ",
      "93. In  support of his contention the learned Deputy  Attorney-General has referred to the judgment of  the learned Arbitrator wherein it has been observed  that petitioners, i.e. respondents herein, approached  the authority, Executive Engineer, Public Works  Department, Pabna for assessment of compensation  of the constructions made by them in the acquired  land, \"But this effort went in vain because of the fact  that the authority was least interested to determine  valuation of the structure. So during trial he prayed  before the Court for appointment of a Private Firm  to assess the valuation of the construction made in  the acquired land\" and the said firm was appointed  and.\"The firm after physical inspection of the land  prepared and submitted survey report and valuation  certificate. Md Ismail Hossain an Assistant Engineer                    SEWA ASSOCIATES LTD as PW 5 in his testimo-  ny stated that after inspection and taking measure-  ment, they have assessed the valuation\", The learned  Arbitrator in the background of the aforesaid obser-  vations awarded compensation at Taka 39,31,000  towards cost of construction, The learned Deputy  Attorney-General placing reliance on the aforesaid  finding and observation of the learned Arbitrator  relating to awarding of costs of constructions sub-  mitted that the High Court Division was in error in  holding that the learned Arbitrator did not solely  relied upon the report of the Private Engineering  Firm while awarding cost for constructions. The  submissions so made appears to be of merit since we  have noticed in the judgment of the learned  Arbitrator that he solely relied while awarding cost  for construction on the report of the Private  Engineering Firm which was quite contrary to the  provision of law as in Rule 8(3) of the Rules, 1983  which runs as follows:    \"In case of acquisition of any building,  including pucca or kutcha, the market value  shall be determined keeping in view the cost of  construction, cost on development of land  including approaches and depreciation of build-  ing in consultation with Public Works  Department.\"    ",
      "17. The learned Deputy Attorney-General in  support of the appeal submitted that awardi  compensation on the & of the report of a Priv  Engineering Firm was contrary to the provision of  law since law requires that compensation in respect  of buildings, including pucca and katcha structures  is to be determined in consultation of the Public  Works department and the appellate Court havii  had noticed that the learned Arbitrator awarded the  compensation for the constructions and structures  on the basis of the report of Private Engineering  Firm which was violation of the law as in Rule 8(3)  of the Rules, 1983 (framed as per provision of sec-  tion 46 of Ordinance II of 1982) and thereupon set  aside the judgment of the learned Arbitrator and  remanded the case to the trial Court for assessment  of compensation in the light of the provision of law,  but the High Court Division erroneously held that  the learned Arbitrator did not assess the compe  tion for constructions and structures on the basis of  the report of Private Engineering Firm alone but  also on other materials on record, through there was  no other materials on record for the purpose of  assessing compensation for the constructions made  in the land acquired except the report of the-Private  Engineering Firm and the Advocate Commission  which is evident from the judgment of the learned  Arbitrator in Miscellaneous Case No.22 of 19",
      "16. Thereupon the appellants filed petition for  leave to appeal against the order rejecting the review  application filed seeking review of the judgment dated  February 18, 1997 in Civil Revision Nos.3575 and  3576 of 1995 as well as against the order dated  February 18, 1997 passed in Civil Revision Nos. 3575  and 3576 of 1995 making the Rules absolute upon set-  ling aside the judgment and order of the appellate  Court in Appeal Nos. 39 and 45 of 1994 and thereupon  restoring the judgment and order dated May 11, 1994  in Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No.22 of 1993.    ",
      "15. It may be mentioned that the appellants  herein filed an application seeking review of the  judgment dated February 18, 1997 passed in civil  revision cases and the same was rejected on March  25,1998 upon observing \"Learned Advocate appear-  ing for the applicant failed to satisfy us that there in  any ground in terms of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC to  review our judgment and order. It is unfortunate that  a frivolous application has been filed to waste time.\"    ",
      "14. The leave was granted for considering the  contentions that the law requires ascertainment of  compensation for construction and structures in  consultation with Public Works Department and the  appeal having been allowed for having not consult-  ed the said department in assessment of the cost of  construction, the High Court Division committed  error of law apparent on the face of the record in  making the Rules absolute upon a view that the legal  requirement can be supplanted by other evidence  and as such the High Court Division was wrong in  rejecting the application for review, that assessment  of compensation (for business loss, staff salary and  diminution of the value of the unacquired land) by  the Arbitrator being ex-facie not tenable in law and  the appeal having been allowed and the case  remanded because both the parties filed appeals  agianst the assessment of compensation by the  Arbitrator, the High Court Division committed error  of law apparent on the face of the record making the  Rules absolute without adverting to the reasons  assigned by the appellate Court for remand.    ",
      "13. A Division Bench of the High Court  Division by the Judgment dated March 25, 1998  made the Rules absolute upon observing that before  the appellate Court it was urged by the appellant in  Miscellaneous Appeal No.45 of 1994 that the trial  Court passed the award on the basis of the  Assessment of value of the building and other strue-  tures as made by a private engineering firm which  was not legal because of the provisions of law as in  Rule 8(3) of the Acquisition of Immovable property  Rules, 1983 published in the gazette on October 31,  1982, but on perusal of the judgment of the  Arbitrator\" we find that the Arbitrator did not pas  award solely on the basis of the report of the  \"Private Engineering Firm\" but also on other mate-  tials on, record\" and that the judgment of the  Arbitrator is \"well reasoned judgment\" and that the  appellate Court set aside the judgment of the  Arbitrator solely on the basis of the submission of  the appellant in the Miscellaneous Appeal No.45 of  1994, that the award as to compensation for building  and structures was made on the basis of the report of  the Private Engineering Firm and thereupon held  that the order of the remand passed by the Appellate  Court was not legally sustainable since there was no                  material\" irregularity and illegality’   in the judgement of the Arbitrator.    ",
      "12. The respondents herein, who were the peti-  tioners in the arbitration case, being aggrieved by  the judgment of the appellate Court moved the High  Court Division in revisional jurisdiction and  obtained the aforesaid rules.    ",
      "11. The appellate Court observed “As per  above provision Public Works Department is the  proper authority to assess the value of the building  and others structures of acquired land but in this  case the same was assessed through a private fi  which is not at all acceptable in the eye of law\" and  thereupon made the order of remand for assessiny  value of the structures in the land acquired and for  determination and assessment of compensation in  other allied matters.

",
      "14. Under the circumstances and in the context  of the above-almitted fact subsequent challenge  thereto is also barred by the principle of waiver and  acquiescence and relinquishment of his earlier sanc-  tion letter in the single name. This writ petition is  barred by the principle of waiver, and acquiescence.  The propositions of waiver and acquiescence have  been aptly discussed in the case of Akhlasur  Rahman vs Safarullah reported in 42 DLR (AD) 189.  The words 'waiver' and ‘acquiescence’ and the aban-  donment of the right was aptly considered in  Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Edition, Volume  14, page 637 wherein it is stated that \"Wavier, is the  abandonment of the right, and is either expressed or  implied from conduct of a person who is entitled to  the benefit of a stipulation in a contract or a statuto-  Ty provision may waive it, and allow the contract or  transaction to proceed as though the stipulation or  provision did not exist. Waiver of this kind depends  upon consent and the fact that the other party has  acted upon it is sufficient consideration. Where the  waiver is not expressed, it may be implied from  conduct, which is inconsistent with the continuance  of the right. It seems that, in general, where one  party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other  @ promise or assurance which was intended to affect  the legal relations between them and to be acted on  accordingly, then once the other party has taken him  at his word and acted on it, the party who gave the  Promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed    to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no  such promise or assurance had been made by him,  but they must accept their legal relations subject to  the qualification which he himself has to introduet-  ed, even though is not supported in point of law by  any consideration.\" In the same volume at page 63%  it has been stated that \"acquiescence\" in its proper  legal sense implies that a person abstains from inter-  fering while a violation of his legal rights is in  progress and further that \"Acquiescence operates by  way of estoppels. It is acquiescence in such circum-  stances that assent may reasonably be inferred, and  is an instance of estoppels by words or conduct.  Consequently, if the whole circumstances are prop-  er for raising these estoppels, the party in acquivs-  cence cannot afterwards complain of the violation of  his right.\"    ",
      "13. Furthermore, we are of the view that in the  instant case in view of the admitted joint allotment  in the name of husband and wife and subsequent  registration of the lease deed in joint name upon  cancellation of the previous allotment and transi-  tion in single name on the prayer of the writ peti-  tioner. Moreover, the writ petitioner received Taka  5,68,000 from respondent No.4 appellant for the  purpose of procuring the plot and construction work  as evidenced from General Irrevocable Power of  Attorney executed by the writ petitioner on 4-!!-  1993 . Construction of the ground floor of the house  and structural works of the 1st and 2nd floors were  also done by the fund provided by Respondent No.4  appellant inasmuch as the writ petitioner a  received Taka 3,06,000 from respondent No.4 for  completion of the construction work and this fact is  evidenced in the 'Receipt and Agreement’ dated 20-  11-1994 executed between the writ petitioner and  respondent No.4 appellant. The aforesaid documents                       are also annexed Annexure-9 and 9A in  afidavit-in-opposition Taka 10,00,000 out of  12,00,000 was also received by the petitioner from  house building finance corporation as loan and was  deposited by hin in his own name in Istamia‘Umma  Corporation as evidenced from an application dated  10.6-19%6 of the petitioner regarding the said  deposit and @ money receipt dated 26-01-1995  annexed as Annexure-10 and 10A in affidavit-in-  opposition, Purthermore, the petitioner applied for a  joan of Taka 35,00,000 from Sonali Bank, Dhaka  Cantonment Branch in joint names though forging  signature of respondent No.4-appellant and drew the  money by opening joint account in 1995.    ",
      "12. Since the single allotment was cancelled  and the joint allotment was done with the full con-  sent and at the behest of the writ petitioner no que  tion of issuing of show cause notice or for assigni  any reason was required and according  be no violation of principle of natural justice.    ",
      "11. Admittedly, the writ petitioner surrendered  the single allotment in his own name alone and for  following provision of rule 6(Ga) of the Army  Officer residential project prospectus Rule 6(Ga)  which reads Git aiferice Dress wh ¢ Ha cory  DIAS Cab] ofertas Bic whe eee ome 25  Yue tare ware ZBc4 1 The alleged letter of the  office of QMG and M&Q department, Dhaka  Cantonment dated 22-6-1994 and alleged reply  dated 28-6-1994 of the writ petitioner was a product  of afterthought which was not there during the allot-  ment and registration of the deed in the joint name  and accordingly the joint allotment is of no fault of  the appellant against which the writ petitioner raised  objection is without any basis and surely as such a  matter of afterthought which cropped up after the  love lost between the husband and wife and a sub-  ject matter of disputed question of fact.    ",
      "10. In writ jurisdiction the disputed question of  fact or any doubt that might crop up could not be  resolved in the writ petition. In the instant case, the  High Court Division has acted upon, inter alia, on  those ‘if and ‘but’ without allowing the parties to  resolve the same in an appropriate forum but in a  cursory manner disposing of the writ petition filed  challenging the order which the writ petitioner him-  self has given yo-by and consequently fresh order of  allotment and registered deed was executed in the  name of husband and wife,    ",
      "9. The High Court Division observed that :  “the whole argument of the learned Counsel for the  petitioner is that admittedly the’ petitioner had got  the single allotment but the respondent No.4 without  having any requisite qualification managed to force  the petitioner to execute and register the joint allot-  ment in respect of the suit plot have no basis of law.  The petitioner at the very beginning was unwilling  to the joint allotment but being in active service in  army he had no other alternative but to give consent  for the sake of service and family bondage. The peti-  tioner being a member of the disciplined force had  to give his consent and this aspect of the case can  not be altogether brushed aside in view of the letter  of the respondent to the Ministry of Home Affairs  vide Annexure-3 of the aflidavit-in-opposition.\"    ",
      "8. It appears that the writ petitioner on his  own initiative filed an application to the authority  for considering joint allotment of the plot cancelling  the single allotment in his name which the authority  in terms of letter dated 13-10-1994 allowed the  prayer of the writ petitioner and cancelled the earli-  er allotment in his own name and registered deed to  that effect and the Government as well acted upon  the executed registered lease deed dated 5-11-1994  in favour of the writ petitioner and the appellant in  their joint names and accordingly the alleged chal-  lenge claimed on the basis of single allotment in the  writ petition which the writ petitioner himself  prayed for cancellation of the same and subsequent  registration of the plot thereon and the authority has  acted upon the same. The impugned allotment letter  dated 30-10-1994 in the joint name in Annexure-G  was of no avail and the writ petition, accordingly,  Was not maintainable. The writ petitioner himself on  his own and to his own volition allowed the single  allotment dated 23-5-1993 of the Plot No.281/C  Mohakhali DOHS cancelled upon his application  for allotment of the plot in joint name which the  authority was pleased to allow and thereafter, issued  sanction letter in joint name and got the registered  deed registered in joint name with the consent and  co-operation of the writ petitioner which according-  ly could not be subject matter of challenge in a writ  jurisdiction. It will not be out of place to mention  that clause 6(Kha) provides that in case of an appli-  cation for allotment of a plot if the spouses are in the  service the qualification for allotment of a plot  would be in the name of the senior and accordingly  the plot was allotted in the name of the husband ini-  tially and upon consent of the husband thereatter,  the said plot was allotted in the joint name and fol-  lowing 6(Ga) the registration was done in joint  name upon an application for allotment of plot by  the senior officer i.e. the husband, writ petitioner  who after allotment for the reason best known to  him got the plot allotted and registered in his own  name alone instead of joint name. After sanction of                    plot, the said plot would be allotted following the  clause 6(Ga) allowed in joint name. It will not be out  of place to mention that the writ petitioner having  realized his fault by the letter to the authority  applied for cancellation of the plot in his own name  and accordingly the said letter dated 31-7-1994 in  favour of the writ petitioner was cancelled and was  directed for registration of the plot in joint name  upon the request of the writ petitioner by his letter  dated 15-9-1994 and 6-10-1994 surrendered the reg-  istered deed in his single name with the request for  registration of the plot in joint name. As a result, the  violation of the allotment letter dated 30-10-1994 in  the joint name was issued and the registration deed  to lease was accordingly executed and registered in  joint name.    ",
      "7. Khondaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed, learned  Counsel, appearing for the respondent submitted  that on the very basis of the registered lease deed has  no legal effect, the deed even if registered cannot  create better title or any vested right in favour of the  appellant, that the registered lease deed cannot  remain valid in law if found by a competent Court;  that the office of the ‘QMG' and 'M & Q'  Depariment, Dhaka Cantonment issued Memo dated  6-1994 requesting the petitioner to send his opin-  jon regarding allotment of his plot in joint names of  which the writ petitioner gave a reply on 28-6-1994  expressing legal difficulties in joint allotment which  in fact disclosed his mind regarding joint allotment  and therefore subsequent registration on surrender-  ing the single allotment in the facts and circum-  stances. Finally, the learned Counsel submitted that  there was no violation of the terms and conditions of  the single allotment by the respondent and as such,  the subsequent joint allotment for no fault of the  respondent against which the respondent raised  objection is arbitrary and malafide; that the joint  allotment impugned in the writ petition having been  issued without any show cause and without assign-  ing any reason is clearly against the principle of nat-  ural justice. The learned Counsel further submitted  that in pursuance of joint letter of allotment dated  30-10-1994 acting in terms thereof, the Government  executed a registered lease deed dated 5-11-1994  inasmuch the complicated title in the property in  question as well as disputed question of fact which  could not be decided in the writ jurisdiction which  needed a properly constituted Court of law for adju-  dication of principle of waiver and acquiescence and  estoppel from questioning the legality of allotment  in joint names.    ",
      "6. Mr Rokanuddin Mahmud, learned  Counsel, appearing for the appellant submitted that  since the joint allotment of plot is violative of allot-  ment Rules disqualifying the appellant for allotment  either individually or jointly for which the allotment  was initially made through the writ petitioner being  the husband and senior officer under the Rules. It  has been further submitted that the joint application                    for allotment thus being barred under the Rules, the  appellant subsequently filed the application after the  sanction of the plot in favour of husband for the said  allotment in her name as well and accordingly the  authority With the full consent of the initial allottee  who has accordingly sought for cancellation of the  allotment in his name and applied for joint allotment  and accordingly registered deed of lease in joint  name WaS registered cancelling the previous regis-  tration lease in single name whereby the appellant as  well has acquired title and vested right in the prop-  erty.    ",
      "5. Leave was granted to consider the submis-  sion of Mr Rokanuddin Mahmud, learned Counsel,  appearing for the appellant that the letter of joint  allotment dated 30-10-1994, acting in terms thereof,  the Government having executed a registered lease  deed dated 5-11-1994 in favour of writ petitioner  and leave petitioner in their joint names, the writ  petition challenging the allotment letter alone,  which has been fully acted upon is not maintainable  inasmuch as after the execution of the registered  lease decd, the allotment letter either has lost its effi.  cacy or merged in to the registered deed that has cre.  ated a vested right under it in favour of the leave  petitioner and writ petitioner jointly and as such  there remained nothing to challenge the allotmen,  letter, and the High Court Division was wrong in  making the Rule absolute declaring the allotment  letter in joint names illegal whereas the revistered  deed executed and registered with consent at the  behest of the writ petitioner which gives the title to  both remains valid in law and thereby the High  Court Division's judgment has created an anomaly,  contradiction and paradox; that the respondent No,  by letter dated 31-7-1994 cancelled the earlier single  allotment in favour of writ petitioner and directed  registration in joint names, whereupon the writ peti-  tioner wrote letters dated 15-9-1994 and 6-10-1994  surrendering the registration in his single name and  requesting for registration in joint names as a result  of which allotment letter dated 30-10-1994 in joint  names was issued and thereafter execution and rey-  istration of the lease deed in favour of writ petition-  er and leave petitioner took place, the High Court  Division was wrong in failing to hold that the writ  petition raised complicated issue of title in the prop-  erty in question as well a disputed question of fact  which could not be decided in writ petition but the  same needed a properly constituted suit for adjudi-  cation; that the writ petitioner admittedly surren-  dered the plot relinquishing his right, title and inter-  est thereon and requested for a joint allotment and as  such barred by the principles of waiver, acquies-  cence and estoppel from questioning the legality of  allotment in joint names.    ",
      "4. The Rule was opposed by the writ respon-  dent No.2, Director, Military Land and Cantonment  Directorate Ministry of Defence and writ respondent  No.4 petitioner's wife of writ petitioner respondent  No.1 . It was stated that writ respondent No:2'upon a  request by the writ petitioner forwarded a proposal  to the Ministry of Defence to allot the plot jointly  and necessary approval was given by the Ministry  after cancelling the previous allotment in favour of  the writ petitioner respondent No.1 as per condi  No.6(Ga) of the prospectus of defence oflicers’  housing project. The Military Land and Cantonment  Directorate by their letter dated 30-8-1994 request-  ed the writ petitioner to surrender his pr  and he surrendered the case plot by registered sur-  render deed on 8-9-1994 and informed the office by                      his letter dated 15-9-1994, The case plot was  accordingly allotted jointly in the names of the writ  petitioner and his wife respondent No.4 according to  the wish and consent of the writ petitioner, The writ  respondent No.4 in her aflidavit-in-opposition, inter  alia, stated that her husband, writ petitioner does not  live at the address given in the writ petition and as a  matter of fact she lives at that address i.e. House  No.281/C, Road No.19/C now DOHS along with  her son and daughters. She is in exclusive posses-  sion of the house on the allotted plot in question.  The writ petitioner had left the house and was  reportedly living with his second wife at Shamoly.  The application for allotment of plot filed by the  writ petitioner was intended to be on his own behalf  and on behalf of the respondent No.4 as contemplat-  ed in clause 6(Ga) of the said prospectus of the  housing project which provides that in case of the  husband and wife both serving in the Army the sen-  ior of the two would have to apply and the plot  would be allotted in their joint names. The writ peti-  tioner was the senior officer and as such, he applied  for allotment of the plot and as per law the single  allotment of the writ petitioner was converted to  joint allotment and accordingly registered lease  deed dated 5-11-1994 was executed in joint names.  The respondent No.4 petitioner claimed that she had  provided Taka 5,68,000 to her husband writ peti-  tioner respondent No.1 for the purpose of construc-  tion of the house. She also stated that the writ peti-  tioner respondent No.1 applied for loan of Taka  35,00,000 from Sonali Bank in joint names by forg-  ing her signature in 1995 . She got a letter from the  Bank with a request to register the mortgage deed,  which she refused. This made her husband writ peti-  tioner respondent No.1 angry and he started to tor-  ture her physically and accordingly, filed the  malafide and false case.    ",
      "3. The High Court Division issued Rule Nisi  upon the writ respondents to show cause as to shy  the letter of allotment dated 30-10-1994 issued by  the Director, Military Land and Cantonment  Directorate Ministry of defence, so far as it relates to  the writ respondent No.4, the present petitioner  should not be declared to have been made without  lawful authority and was of no legal effect and why  the allotment of the entire plot should not be given  in favour of the writ petitioner respondent No.1.    ",
      "2. This case of respondent No.1 as writ peti-  tioner was that while serving in Bangladesh Army  he applied for allotment of a plot in Johar-sahara  residential project on 10-12-1991 . Thereafter, at his  request he was allotted an alternative Plot No.281/C  at Mohakhali DOHS on 23-5-1993 . Vacant posses-  sion was delivered and lease deed was executed on  10-6-1993 . He applied for approval of the plan and  after obtaining necessary approval of the plan from  the Cantonment Board, mortgaged the said plot and  obtained loan for construction of residential build-  ing thereon. After obtaining a loan of Taka 12 lacs to  be paid in 6 instalments of Taka 2 lacs each from  House Building Finance Corporation he constructed  structure upto 2nd floor of the 6(six) storied build-  ing. At that time he suddenly got a letter from the  office of the Dhaka Cantonment requesting him for  his opinion for allotment of the plot in the joint  name with his wife by a letter dated 28-6-1994 . He  replied that there would be legal difficulties in joint  allotment and therefore, refused the proposal for  joint allotment with his wife's name who is the peti-  tioner before us. His further case was that the allot-  ment authority considering his representation  agianst the joint allotment and legal difficulties. uni-  laterally converted the single allotment into the joint  allotment on 30-10-1994 and a lease deed of joint  allotment was executed on 5-11-1994 . It was also  stated by him that the petitioner's wife, as per clause  6 of the prospective of defence officers’ housing  project, was not entitled to apply for joint allotment  of any plot as she had not. completed 18 years com-  mission service in the Army and she was also owner  of a government residential plot at Chittagong, She  was also. not in service. at the. time of the alleged  joint allotment and the same was done with malatide  intention and to harass him.

Judgment  Md Abdul Matin J: These petitions for leave to  appeal are directed against the judgment and order  dated 15-11-2007 passed by the High Court  Division in Writ Petition No.11817 of 2006 (heard  analogously with Writ Petition Nos.5198 of 2003,  Writ Petition No,11818 of 2006, Writ Petition  No.11819 of 2006 and Writ Petition No.3466 of    2004 making the Rule absolute.  ",
      "Section 8B    From the scheme of the law it appears that    section 93A provided a complete law for requ  tion and acquisition of the property and also pay-  ment of compensation and as per section  93(4)(h), once the property is requisitioned under  this law the same shall vest absolutely in the  Board free from all encumbrances and the peri-  od of such requisition of such property shall end.    From a close reading of the above section it appears  that section $B deals with withdrawal from the acquisition  of those lands which were acquired under section 5 of the  Act of 1948 and not the land acquired under any other law  (16, 18)    i.e. Town Improvement Act, 1953.    ",
      "25. Moreover the High Court Division hay  rightly termed the judgment passed in Writ Petition  No.835 of 1977 as not binding being a judgment ‘per  incuriam’ and it is settled principle that a judgmeny  ‘per incuriam' or a judgment sub silentio do not con.  stitute a precedent. Further more those cases ary  passed and closed transaction and will not be affect.  ed by the present judgment as we are adopting the  doctrine of prospective overruling to restrict. our  decision to the present case and to the future cases,    With the above observations all the leave peti-  tions are dismissed.    Ed.    APPELLATE DIVISION  (Criminal)  Md Fazlul Karim J | Jahedul Islam @ Jabed  Md Joynul Abedin J | u...........:eeeeeee  SAN Mominur  Rahman J  Judgment  May 26th, 2009.    «++-Petitioner  vs    State    Respondent*  ",
      "24. It is pertinent to mention here that accord-  ing to Salmond a precedent is a judicial decision,  which contains in itself a principle. The underlying  principle, which thus forms its authoritative ele-  ment, is often termed the ratio decidendi. The con-  crete decision is binding between the parties to it but    it is the abstract ratio decidendi, which alone has the  force of law as regards the world at large,    ",
      "23. In those cases the question whether the  land even if acquired under section 5 of the Act of  1948 could be released after payment of compensa-  tion was also not an issue and therefore are not  applicable in these cases. In the case of Abdul  Mannan vs Ministry of Land Administration and  Land Reforms, Govt. of Bangladesh reported in 27  DLR 597 it was held that once compensation is paid  the acquisition process reaches its finality and the  land cannot be de-requisitioned under section 8B of  the Emergency Requisition of Property Act, 1948.  This view was approved by this Court in the case of  Bangladesh represented by the Secretary, Ministry  of Land Administration and Land Reforms ys  Commercial Trust of Bangladesh reported in 46  DLR (AD) 89 wherein it was held that \"after com-  pensation is paid for acquisition of land no order can  be made for derequisition of such land.\"    ",
      "22. As to the judgment of the High Court  Division in Writ Petition No. 835 of 1977 and the  judgment of this Court in Civil Appeal Nos. 36 and  37 of 1998 and the judgment of this Court in Civil  Petition for Leave to Appeal No.122 of 2000 suffice  it to say that the question whether Government was  competent to release the land acquired under section  93A of the Town Improvement Act that vested in  RAJUK could be released by the Government was  not at all an issue and therefore those judgments  have no bearing on these cases where the compe-    tence of the Government in releasing the land of ©    RAJUK has been challenged.    ",
      "21. It further appears from the above section  that once compensation has been paid it reaches its  finality and thereafter such land cannot be released    even under the Act of 1948.    ",
      "20. This view was taken by this Court in the  case Abdul Hug vs Bangladesh reported in 9 BLC  (AD) 56 and in the case of Sadeque Uddin Ahmed vs                  Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakha (RAJUK) reported in  3 MLR (AD) 91.    ",
      "19. Admittedly the land in question were  acquired under section 93A of the Town  Improvement Act and the same vested in the Board  free from all encumbrances and therefore the  Government cannot release the same taking resort to  section 8B as quoted above of the Act of 1948,    ",
      "18. From a close reading of the above section  it appears that section 8B deals with withdrawal  from the acquisition of those lands which were  acquired under section S of the Act of 1948 and not  the land acquired under any other law i.e. Town  Improvement Act, 1953.    ",
      "17. Admittedly the property in question was  acquired as per section 93A of the Town  Improvement Act 1953 and it vested in RAJUK free  from all encumbrances.    Section 8B of the Requisition of Property Act.  1948 runs as under :  <br>  \"8B. Withdrawal from Acquisition—When  the owner of any property which has been  acquired under section 5 is willing to receive  back the property, the Government may, at any  time before the payment of compensation, with-  draw from the acquisition of any such property  by notification published in the Official  Gazette, and on such withdrawal, the property  shall be restored to the possession of the owner,  and with effect from the date of.such restora-  tion, the property shall vest back in the owner  with the rights which he had before such prop-  erty was acquired.\"    ",
      "16. From the scheme of the law it appeal  93A provided a complete law for re  acquisition of the property and also paymet  compensation and as per section 93(4)(h), one  property is requisitioned under his law the  shall vest absolutely in the Board free from  encumbrances and the period of such requisition of  such property shall end.    ",
      "15. Town Improvement Act, 1953 was enacted  in the year 1953 and section 93A was inserted in the  said Act by East Pakistan Ordinance No.49 of 1953  and the same was amended from time to time. sec-  tion 93A(1) nuns as under :    \"93A(1). Requisition of property for any  scheme—When any immovable property is  required by the Board for carrying out any of  the purposes of this Act, the Government may  direct the Deputy Commissioner to requisition  such property for the Board by an order in writ-  ing:    Provided that no property used by the pub-  lic for the purpose of religious worship shall be  requisitioned.\"    Section 93(4)(h) runs as under :  <br>  \"The Government shall then publish in the  official gazette a notice to the effect that the  Government has decided to acquire the requisi-  tioned property for the Board. On and from the  beginning of the day on which the notice is so  published, the requisitioned property shall vest  absolutely in the Board free from all encum-  brances and the period of such requisition of  such property shall end.\"    ",
      "14. He lastly submitted that the order of with-  drawal from acquisition have been made after pay-  ment of compensation to the land owner, the same is  direct. contravention of section 8B of The  (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948 and  as such, the same is made without lawful authority  and is of no legal effect.    ",
      "13. He submitted that the Board under the  Town Improvement Act, 1953 being the lawful  owner of the land acquisitioned and having duly  allotted and leased out to the respondent and others:  after making improvement of the land at huge cost  and valuable right and interest of third parties hav-  ing been created thereon, the respondents have no  awtitl authority to disturb such past and closed  transaction.    ",
      "12. He further submitted that the concerned  acquisition proceeding in LA Case No.10/1963-  1964 having been initiated and completed by acqui-  sition and vesting the land with the Board under sec-  tion 93A of the Town improvement Act, 1953 pur-  ported derequisition is meaningless and is of no  legal effect and as such should be struck down.                  ",
      "11. Mr AF Hassan Arif, learned Counsel  appearing for the respondent No.8 submitted that in  view of the provisions of section 93A of the Town  Improvement Act, 1953 under which the acquisition  process was started in the concerned LA Case  No.10/1963-1964 and the provision of section  73(Uma) of the town Improvement (Amendment)  Act, 1987 (Act, xxix of 1987) continuing the provi-  sion of section 93A for such proceeding, the  impugned order of derequisition purportedly issued  under section 8B of the (Emergency) Requisition of  Property Act, 1948 is totally without lawful author-  ity and is of no legal effect.    ",
      "10. He further submitted that in view of the  decision of the Appellate Division, relating to same  plot of land (plot No.367) and also the same Gazette  Notification dated 11-11-1999, given in Civil  Appeal Nos.36 and 37 of 1998, the decision of the  High Court Division is illegal and contrary to  Article 111 of the Constitution.    ",
      "9. Mr Rafiq-ul-Huq, learned Counsel appear.  ing for the petitioner mainly argued that the Tespon-  dent No.7 of the writ petition i.e. petitioner herein  purchased the land from its original owner by r  tered kabala dated 14-11-1973 and respondent No, y  RAJUK took decision for abandonment of the project  and for de-requisition of the same in between 1969.  1971 and the question of derequisition reached ity  finality at the judgment and order dated 12-7-1979 of  Writ Petition No.835 of 1977 and as such the question  of allocation of any land from the land of said LA  Case by the respondent No.8 dated 16-11-1995 ang  lease deed dated 23-12-1997 (Annexure-B and 1-2  respectively) being totally absurd and cannot be sus-  tained in law and the High Court Division seriously  erred in Law in making the Rule absolute.    ",
      "8. The question that was raised before the  High Court Division was whether a property  acquired under a Jaw can be released under the pro-  vision of another law, in other wards, the property in  questions acquired under section 93A of the Town  Improvement Act whether could be released under  section 8B of the (Emergency) Requisition of  Property Act 1984 and the High Court Division  answered the question in the negative.    ",
      "7. Heard .Mr  Rafique-ul-Hugq, learned  Counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr AF  Hasan Ariff, learned Counsel appearing for the  respondent No.8 and others and perused the petition  and the impugned judgment and order of the High  Court Division and other papers on record.    ",
      "6. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order  of the High Court Division, the petitioners have  filed these petitions for leave to appeal.    ",
      "5. After hearing the High Court Division  madéall the Rules absolute.    ",
      "48. The case of the  writ petitioner was that the authority cannot publish  such gazette notification exercising the power con-  ferred under section 8B of the Act of 1948 as the  same was already repealed with effect from 13-3-  1982 and being aggrieved moved the writ petitions  and obtained a Rule.    In Writ Petition Nos.11817, 11818, 11819 of  2006 and 3466 of 2007 the respective petitioners on  an advertisement made by RAJUK applied for allot-  ment of plots. On the basis of their applications the  RAJUK issued formal allotment letters in their  favour, Pursuant to the allotment letters the respec-  tive petitioners paid in full the royalty/premium to  the lessor namely RAJUK and after satisfaction the  lessor namely RAJUK executed registered lease  deeds for 99 years of the respective plots as men-  tioned in these writ petitions with the respondent  petitioner and also handed over formal possession  thereof. The further case of the writ petitioners is  that they constructed houses as per approved plan  and have been enjoying and possessing the same.  All ona sudden, some people entered into the prem-  ises and claimed ownership of the said plots by  virtue of sale deeds obtained from the original own-  ers from whom the aforesaid land was acquired by  the lessor as per Town Improvement Act of 1953.  On query the Writ petitioners came to know that the  Ministry of Land issued a gazette notification which  was impugned in all the writ petitions wherein the  Ministry of Land released certain portion of land  from acquisition exercising the power conferred  under section 8B of the Act of 1948.    In Writ Petition No.5198 of 2001 though notice  were served in accordance with law but the same  was not contested by any respondents in any man-  ner. In Writ Petition No.3466 of 2007 the respondent  No.8 (RAJUK) contested the Rule by filing affi-  davits-in-opposition whereas respondent No.7 (one  Mst Sufia Khatun) contested in Writ Petition Nos.  11817 11818 and 11819 of 2006 by filing affidavits-  in-opposition as well as respondent No. 8 (RAJUK)  entered appearance by filing power. The case of the  respondent No.7 in the aforesaid three writ petitions  is that the contention raised by the petitioners are  misconceived one and the same has been denied by  the respondents. The respondent No.7 purchased the  land from the persons whose predecessor-in-interest  was the original landlord and admittedly the land  was acquired in LA Case No.10 of 1963-64 but the  requiring authority decided to derequisition certain                  portion of land which attracts the purchased lands of  the respondent No.7 . On one occasion the authori-  ties refused to release the land to one Mr Khademul  Islam Chowdhury who being aggrieved preferred  Writ Petition No.835 of 1977 wherein the High  Court Division after hearing the parties made the  Rule absolute. On review the High Court Division  maintained the earlier order and the appeal by  RAJUK to the Appellate Division was summarily  rejected, The further case of the respondent No.7 is  that by virtue of the decision of the Apex Court, the  Ministry of Land issued a memo dated 8-2-1999  cancelling the entire proceeding of LA Case No.10  of 1963-64 and by virtue of that letter the Ministry  of land issued the gazette notification and as such  the same cannot be interfered with by the Court in a  proceeding under Article 102 of the Constitution.  The further case of the respondent No.7 was that the  Writ Petition No.11817 of 2006 is not maintainable,  as the said application was preferred by a constitut-  ed Attorney.    ",
      "53. The Government by the  said gazette notification withdrew 14.68 acres of  land from acquisition exercising the power con-  ferred under section 8B of the Emergency  Acquisition of Property Act, 19",
      "4. The short facts leading to the petition for  leave to appeal are as follows :    In Writ Petition No.5198 of 2003, the property  in question was acquired in LA Case No.10 of 1963-  64 as per the provisions of section 93A of the Town  Improvement Act, 15",
      "3. In Writ Petition No.S198 of 2003 the  respondent as the petitioner, Rajdhani Unnayan  Kartipakha (RAJUK) challenged the gazette notifi-  cation dated 2-8-2001 as evidenced by Annexure-B  to the writ petition. In Writ Petition Nos.11317,  11818, 11819 of 2006 and 3466 of 2007 the respon-  dents as petitioners challenged the gazette notifica-  tion bearing memo No.Bhu:Ma:/Sha-10/Hu:tha:/  Dhaka-11/92-3691, dated 13-10-1999 as published  in Bangladesh Gazette on 11-11-1999,    ",

On perusal of the depositions as well as the  judgments passed by the Special Tribunal and the  High Court Division in the instant case and having  regard to the submissions made by the learned  Advocate as well as the manner of arrest of the con-  vict-petitioner after chasing them following the  encounter in the face of firing’ by the convicts  towards the police force and the recovery of the  arms and ammunitions from their possession, we are  of the view that discrepancies pointed out by the  learned Advocate cannot disprove charges levelled  against the convict-petitioner. The convict-petition-  er and others were caught red handed. The Hi  Court Division considered the materials and evi-  dence on record and on detailed discussion, as quot-  ed hereinabove, has correctly arrived at its decision  dismissing the appeal and upholding the conviction  and sentence passed by Special Tribunal.

      "5. We have perused the leave petition, the  impugned judgment and order passed by the High  Court Division and the judgment passed by the  Special Tribunal as well as the depositions, copy of  which are annexed to the leave petition. We have  also considered the submission made by the learned  Advocate appearing for the leave petitioner, The  learned Advocate submitted that the High Court    Division erred in law in not considering the discrep.  ancies appearing in the depositions of the PW | and  PW 4 in respect of the arms recovered from the con.  vict-petitioner and also in not considering the depo.  sitions of the witnesses to the seizure list, why  denied to have seen the recovery of arms from the  convict-petitioner and hat the seizure list witnesses  PW 6 and PW 7 in their respective deposition stated  that they did not see any recovery of arm from the  convict-petitioner and, as such, the conviction of the  convict-petitioner is illegal and without any basis,    ",
      "4. The convict-petitioner, being aggrieved,  preferred Criminal Appeal No.3973 of 2003 to the  High Court Division under section 30 of the Special  Powers Act, 1974 and the High Court Division  heard the appeal and dismissed the same by the  impugned judgment and order dated 24-9-2007  observing that :  <br>  \"We have perused the impugned judgment  and order, the evidences and the record and  heard the submissions of the learned Advocates  of both sides.

The  learned Assistant Attorney-General has relied in  the decisions reported in 59 DLR 492; 1996  BLD (AD) 268 . In the case of SM Kamal vs  State 6 BLC 113 it has been observed that other  public seizure-list witnesses did not support the  Prosecution case in spite of that there is no legal  bar to convict the appellant on the unimpeach-  able evidence of the police. Therefore, we find  that the charges framed under section 10(a) and  19(f) of the Arms Act have been proved against  the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt and  the learned Tribunal taking compassionate view  awarded minimum sentence which is to run  concurrently.\"    ",

It appears that while disposing ofthe  appeal the Administrative Appellate Tribunal  observed as follows :    \"In view however of the facts and circum-  stances of the case we are inclined in the inter-  est of justice to allow the competent authoirty  an opportunity to proceed fresh agaisnt the  appellant on the same allegations.\"    ",
      "10. Having given our anxious consideration  tothe materials on record and after hearing the  learned Advocate of both the sides we hold that the  Administrative Appellate Tribunal committey  wrong and illegality in allowing the appeal.    ",
      "9. Admittedly the respondent was charged for  misconduct alleging that on 20-6-1984 while he was  posted as Sergeant in Dhaka Metropolitan Police he  apprehended a Microbus with a driver and actually  recovered 20 bales of Indian cloth but while lodging  the First Information Report he showed recovery of  only two bales and misappropriated the remaining.  The occurrence took place within Dhaka Metropo-  litan area where the respondent was posted atthe rel-  evant time. On receipt of the First Information  Report fromthe respodnent Dhanondi PS Case No. 6  1(6) 84 was started. Thereafter on 8-7-1984 the  respondent was transferred by the Inspector General  of Police to Khulna where he joined on 15-7-1984.  It is also an admitted fact that on 30-7-1984 the  respondent was placed under suspension and pro-  ceeding was drawn up agaisnt him under Police  Officers (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1976 ona  charge of corruption. It is also an admitted fact that  show cause notice was served upon the respodnent  on 15-10-1984 and he submitted his written state-  ment in his defence on 27-10-1984 . He was to be    heard in person on 4-11-1984 by appellant No.3  Subsequently on completion of inquiry report »  submitted and ultimately respondent was compulea-  rily retired from service on 17-11-1984 the  Administrative Appellate Tribunal found that after  transfer of the respodnent from Dhaka to Khulna the    Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dhaka tus no  authority to initiate proceeding and to pass a  ciplinary order compulsorily retiring the respondent  This procecidng was initiated under the Police  Officers (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1976 . The  Administrative Appellate Tribunal placing reliance  on regulation 859 of Police Regulation observed  that the proceeding ought to have been initiated and  conducted by the Superintendent of Police of  Khulna where at the relevant time the respodnent  was posted. Admittedly the occurrence took pal:  while respondent was posted in Metropolitan Police  at Dhaka, Section 6 of the Ordinance provided that  when a police officer is to be proceeded for any of  the offences mentioned in section 4 the authority  concerned shall frame a charge and specify therein  penalty proposed to be imposed and communicate it  to the police officer hereinafter clled \"accused\"  requiring him to show cause within specified time  which shall not be less than 7 days and not more  than 10 days from the date the charge has been com-  municated to him why penalty proposed to be  imposed shall not be imposed and also to state  whether he desires to be heard in person. Now sec-  tion 2(A) of the Ordinance defined \"authority\" as the  authority specified in column 2 of the schedule. In  column 2 of the schedule it has been provided that  in case of a sergeant the authority would be Deputy  Inspector General of Police and in case of Metro-  politician area Police Commissioner or Additional  Police Commissioner. Admittedly the respondent  was acting as Sergeant in the Dhaka Metropolitan  Police and as such as per this Ordinance it is the  Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dhaka or the  Additional Commissioner who was competent to  draw up proceeidng and that has been done in the  present case. Admittedly when the proceeidng was  initiated by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner  the respondent was posted in Khulna, In this  Ordinance there is nothing that in case of transfer                    before drawing up of proceeding the same should be  drawn up or initiated or proceeded with at the place  where the accused is posted. This Ordinance indi-  cate tht the proceeding may be initiated/drawn up  when the alleged offence has been committed.  Though in Regulation 859 of PRB it has been pro-  vided that the Superintendent of Police where such  an officer is posted will be fully competent to take  any disciplinary action for an offence committed by  such an officer when he was posted outside his juris-  diction but in view of sction 3 of the Ordinance this  Regulation 859 has lost its force as section 3 pro-  vided that this Ordinance shall have effect notwith-  standing anything contained in any law, rules and  regulations relating to police force not shall preju-  dice operation of any other law, Rules and regula-  tions including service conditions of the said police  force. When a proceeding is drawn up against a pol-  cie official under this Ordinance the plea that his  case is to be decided under any other law will have  no effective force. So in the present case regulation  859 cannot be a bar in proceeding with the discipli-  nary action against the respondent by the Metro-  politan Police Commissioner in Dhaka. It is an  admitted fact that the accused respondent was trans-  ferred to Khulna by the Inspector Generral of Polcie  and he has been charged and proceeded with for an  offence committed by him while posted in Dhaka  Metropolitan Police by the Police Commissioner of  Dhaka Metropolitan Police and in view of the clear  provision of the Ordinance we hold tht no illegality  and wrong has been’ committed in this case. Int he  Ordinance there is nothing toshow that in case of  such a nature the concerned authority is required to  send the record of the proceeidng to the Superinten-  dent of Police where the accused has been subse-  quently transferred and when there is no such provi-  sion in the Ordinance and when this Ordinance  override all other laws, rules and regulations we  hold that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal  committed wrong and illegality in allowing the  appeal holding that appellant No.3 i.e. the Police  Commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police had no  jurisdiction in taking disciplinary action agaisnt the  respodnent. In such a case provision of regulation  859 of PRB and section 9 of the DMP Ordinance (III    of 1973) willhave no effect and bar in holding  inquiry and punishing an accused.    ",
      "8. From the perusal of the judgment it appears  that the Adminstrative Tribunal also dismissed the  case on the ground of limitation which was set aside  by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal but leave  was not granted on the point of limitation, Leave was  appellant No.3,  Metropolitan Police Commissioner to pass the  impugned order of compulsory retirement of the  respondent Leave was also granted in the Civil  Petition filed by the respodnentNo. Anwarul Islam  against certain observations made by the  Administrative Appellate Tribunal, The first point  raised by the Additional Attorney General is that the  Administrative Appellate Tribunal committed  wrong and illegality in holding that drawing up of  the proceeding against the respondent by appellant  No. 3 i.e. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dhaka  after transfer of the respondent from Dhaka to  Khulna and joining there is contrary to Jaw and dis-  cipline and it is the Superintendent of Police of  Khulna where the respondent was posted on the date  of drawing up proceeding was competent to proceed  with the inquiry  ",
      "7. Mr Amir-ul-Islam,  larned Advocate  appearing for the petitioner (In Civil Petition  No.330 of 1997) submits that the learned Appellate  Tribunal acted in excess of its jurisdiction by mak-  ing the observation in the judgment as above caus-  ing prejudice to the petitioner. The observation is  liable to be deleted fromt he said impugned judy-  ment, he submits.\"                    ",
      "6. Mr B Hossain, learned Deputy Attorney  General appearing for the opposite party petitioner  (Civil Petition No.326 of 1997) submits that the  leamed Appellate Tribunal upon a misconception of  law and facts wrongly held that the Metropolitan  Police Commissioner, Dhaka cased to have jurisdic-  tion for taking disciplinary action against the peti-  tioner (respondent) causing failure of justice. He  also submits that the order of compulsory retirement  passed agaisnt the petitioner is protected by section  8 of the Police Officers (Special Provisions)  Ordinance, 1976.    ",
      "5. On being aggrieved by the order of dis-  missal of the case respondent preferred Appeal No.  29 of 1995 before the Administrative Appellate  Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal on hearing  allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the  Administrative Tribunal and declared that the  respondent is still in service and entitled to all ben-  efits upon setting aside the order of compulsory  reurement. The Administrative Tribunal however  observed that the competent authority will be at lib-  erly to proceed against the respondent afresh on the  same allegation if they so desire and the appellant  will continue to remain in suspension till final order    is passed, The present appellant and the respondent  on being aggrieved by the same judgment of the  Administrative Appellate Tribunal filed two Leave  petitions and leave was granted to consider the fol.  lowing:    \"It appears from the impugned judgmen  that the Appellate Tribunal took the view thar  since opposite party No. 3 drew up proceeding  against the petitioner after he had joined  District Police force, Khulna on transfer he (Op  No. 3) had no jurisdiction for taking discipli-  nary action against the petitioner because the  provisions of Regulation No.859 of PRB, and  section 9 of the DMP Ordinance (III of 1976)  provide that when a police detachment is trans-  ferred to another jurisdiction the authority of  taking disciplinary action against that detach-  ment will lie with the competent authority of  the latter jurisdiction for all purposes and the  jurisdiction of the authority of ofrmer station  will cease. The Appellate Tribunal also found  that the application of the petitioner was not  time barred and the decision of the Tribunal  below on that point ws wrong.    ",
      "4. Before the Administrative Tribunal both  the parties adduced evidence and the Tribunal on  consideration of the same by judgment dated 18-2-  1995 dismissed the case on two counts, firstly that  the case is time barred and secondly that no illegal-  ity has been committed in passing the order of com-  pulsory retirement.    ",
      "3. The case was contested by appellant No. 2  the Inspector General of Police by filing a written  statement denying the meterial allegations. It was  the case of the contesting party that from the  Microbus 20 bales of Indian cloths were seized but  after producing only two bales to the duty officer the  first information report was lodged stating that only  two bales were seized consequent to which a depart-  mental proceeding was started against the respon-  dent on charge of misconduct and corruption under  Clause 4(1) and 4(IV) of the aforesaid Ordinance of  1976 and after observing the formalities including  second show cause notice respondent was compul-  sorily retired from service on 17-1-1984 under the  aforesaid Ordinance.    ",
      "2. The short fact leeading to these appe:  that Md Anwarul Islam, former Police Serz  appellant in Civil Appeal No.6] of 1997 filed  Administrative Tribunal Case No.107 of 199] allez-  ing that earlier he was posted at eastern Police Post,  Dhaa and on 20-6-1984 at dead of night while he  was returning home from duty station at East  Dhanmondi Police outpost he found a Microbus  bearing No. Dhaka-Cha-1456 moving suspiciously  and after a chase he arrested the driver and found  two bales of Indian cloth in the Microbus. He then  escorted the driver and the Microbus and cloths to  Dhanmondi Police Station with the help of another  polcie sergeant and handed over the driver, the  Microbus and two bales of Indian cloth and lodged  First Information Report which was recorded as  Dhanmondi PS Case No.61(6) 84 under section  156(4) of the Customs Act. It is the case of the peti-  tioenr that thereafter he was transferred to Khulna  on 8-7-1984 by the Inspector General of Police  where he joined on 15-7-1984 . It is his further case  that Assistant Commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan  Polcie investigated the case and submitted a report  on 16-7-1984 . On 30-7-1984 respondent-petitioner  was suspended by the Metropolitan Police  Commissioner, Dhaka ont he basis of that reprot and  a proceeding drawn up agaisnt him under the Police  Officers (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1976 on a  charge of corruption on the allegation of illegally  releasing 18 bales of Indian cloth seized by him. A  show cause notice was served upon him on 15-10-  1984 to which he submitted a written statement in  his defence on 27-10-1984 denying all the charges  brought against him. In that proceedng was fixed for  personal hearing before the inquiry officer where he  appeared but was not heard. Then the inquiry officer  completed the inquiry but the copy of thecharge  sheet of the Dhanmondi Police Station case was not                      supplied to him and thereby he was denied the  opportunity of defence. Then by order dated 17-11-  1984 he was compulsorily retired from service.  Then the respondent preferred appeal which w:  rejected on 7-3-1985 Then again revisional applica-  tion was filed on 30-3-1985 which was also rejected  on 16-1-1991 and thereafter the aforesaid case  before the Administrative Tribunal was filed on 28-  4.1991,    "

This person is definitely a person who  was asked under section 26(1) of the ACC Act, 2004  to submit statement of assets.

Offence of  abetment under section 109 is equally could not be  conceived of with regard to such an offence.    ",
      "7. Mr Khurshid Alam  Khan. learned  Advocate, appearing for the petitioner submitted  that the High Court Division failed to conceive that  the writ petitions are maintainable as contemplated  in sections 4 and 5 of the Emergency Powers  Ordinance, 2007 debarring challenging of the Acts  of the delegated authority in any Court; that the  High Court Division erred in law interpreting sec-  tion 26(2) and 27(1) of the ACC Act, 2004 and Rule  15%(5) of the Emergency Powers Rules, 2007 read  with section 109 of the Penal Code and passed order  of stay of criminal proceedings out of misconcep-  tion of the law, The learned Advocate further sub-  mitted that the High Court Division has misdirected  itself and failed to appreciate that due satisfaction  contemplated in section 26(2) of the ACC Act, 2004  is only culminated through issue of the prescribed  order under Rule 27(1) in terms of Form-5 after  enquiry only, when investigation is that next step  which has been stayed by stay order, that the High  Court Division stayed operation of law itself viz the  ACC Act, 2004 and ACC Rules, 2007 read with  Emergency Powers Ordinance, 2007 and  Emergency Power Rules, 2007 which are nugatory  to achieve the object of curbing corruption. The  learned Advocate finally submitted that the High  Court Division has lost sight of the fact that the peti-  tioner has already complied with the order by  declaring the assets which on investigation has  shown prima facie ingredients of the offence tor  indictment of the petitioner and that on the  of violation of any mandatory procedural provision                    the High Court Division stayed of proceedings  allowing the offenders to escape criminal justice  inasmuch as the notice in this case is the tool to-gother evidence on asset and it is in no way concerned with natural justice which shall be available to the petitioner in trial.    ",
      "6. The respondent No.2, Chairman of the  Commission, appeared but did not file any affidavit  in the writ petitions.    ",
      "5. After receipt of the charge sheet, the case  record was sent to the Court of Metropolitan Senior  Special Judge at Dhaka where the case was renum-  bered as Metro Special CaseNo.79 of 2008 . By an  order dated 10-6-2008 cognizance of offences under  section 26(2) and 27(1) of the ACC Act, 2004 reaq  with section 109 of the Penal Code were taken  against all of them. Then, the case record was trar  ferred to the 4th Court of Special Judge at Sher-c-  Bangla Nagar, Dhaka for trial. On 25-6-2008 the  case record was received and renumbered as Special  Case No.5 of 2008 . The case is now pending for  charge to be framed.    ",
      "4. In Writ Petition Nos.1777 of 2008 and  1778 of 2008 . MAH Selim, son, wife and daughter  of the principal accused are petitioners. The son is a  Managing Director of a Company and individual  Tax Payee having TIN No.149-100-9464/Company  Circle-IV/Zone-II/Dhaka. The wife is also Director  of a Company and income Tax Payee having TIN  No.85-100-0652/Company —Circle-IV/Zone-II/  Dhaka and the daughter is married and Director of a  Company. She is also a regular Tax Payee having  TIN No.19-100-19611/C-IV/Zone-II/Dhaka. The  Commission served an order dated 29-5-2007 pur-  portedly under section 26(1) of the ACC Act, 2004  upon the said Principal accused MAH Selim, former  Member of Parliament from  Bagerhat-II  Constituency while he was in custody asking him to  submit statement of assets, moveable and immove-  able and assets liability, sources of income acquired  in his name or in the names of other dependents  upon him including wife, son or daughter within  seven days of receipt of thereon. Steps would be  taken against him if he failed to submit the said  statement of assets within the time fixed or submits.  false statement under section 26(2). In pursuance  thereof, MAH Selim submitted statement of assets  on 10-6-2007 . The Commission on 6-12-2007  Jodged an FIR being Ramna PS Case No,29 dated 6-  12-2007 corresponding to ACC GR No.157 of 2007  against all of them for concealment of Taka  12,378,83,927.65 . After investigation, the police  submitted charge sheet against all of them,    ",
      "3. After receipt of the charge sheet, the Chief  Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka transferred the ease  record to the Court of Metropolitan Senior Special  Judge, wherein the case was registered as Metro  Special Case No.S2 of 2008 . The said Senior Special  Judge by his order dated 30-4-2008 took cognizance  of offences against the writ-petitioner and her hus-  band. Then, the case was renumbered as Special  Court Case No.03 of 2008 . The said Special Judge  framed charges against the petitioner and her hus-  band. The last date of case was fixed on 23-7-2008.    ",
      "2. The facts involved in the case, in short, are  that the writ-petitioner is stated to be the wife of the  principal accused Md Tahmilur Rahman who was  former Managing Director of Sonali Bank. The writ-  petitioner is an individual Tax Payee having TIN  No.205-104-9194/C-88/Dhaka. The Commission  served an order dated 30-7-2007 upon Md Tahmilur  Rahman under section 26(1) of the ACC Act, 2004  asking him to submit statement of assets acquired in  his name or in the name of his wife or any other  dependent upon him, including source of income  within seven days of receipt thereof. Steps would be  taken against him under section 26(2) of the ACC  Act, 2004 if he failed to submit that statement of  assets or submit false statement. On 30-9-2007 hus-  band of the petitioner submitted statement of assets.  Then, on 11-11-2007 an FIR being Ramna PS Case  No.49/113 corresponding to ACC GR No.166 of  2007 was lodged against her husband and her for  illegal acquisition through corruption and conceal-  ment of information of assets of Taka 1,18,00,970.  After investigation, the police on 27-4-2008 submit-  ted charge sheet against both of them.                    "

      "8. Mr Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advo-  cate, appearing for the petitioner submitted that the  High Court Division erred in interpreting sections  26(2) and 27(1) of the ACC Act, 2004 and Rule 15  Gha(5) of the Emergency Power Rules, 2007 and  passing an order of stay of criminal proceedings due  to misconception of law; that due satisfaction con-  templated in section 26(2) is only culminated  through issue of the prescribed order under rule  27(1) in terms of Form 5 after enquiry only, when  investigation is the next step which has been stayed  by stay order. The learned Advocate further submit-  ted that the High Court Division Stayed operation of  law itself viz the Act, 2004 and ACC Rules, 2007  read with Emergency Power Ordinance, 2007 and                  Emergency Power Rules, 2007 which is nugatory to  achieve the object of curbing the corruption. The  learned Advocate also submitted that the High Court  Division lost sight of the fact that the petitioner has  already complied with the order by declaring the  assets Which on investigation has shown prima facie  ingredients of the offence for indictment of the peti-  sioner.

      "6. We accept the above view of the High  Court Division as it is a settled principle of law that  the object of sentence should be to see that crime  does not go unpunished and the society has the sat-  isfaction that justice has been done and it will be a  mockery of justice to permit the offender to escape  the extreme penalty of law when faced with cruel act  perpetrated by him and moreover to give lesser pun-  ishment to the offender who stood convicted in a  shocking and revolting crime would render the  Justice System of the country in question and to    award inadequate sentence under sympathy would  do harm to Justice System and would undermine  pubic confidence in the efficacy of law.    ",
      "5. Regarding the submission of the learned  counsel of the petitioner that in view of the tender  age of the petitioner the sentence of death imposed  upon him may be commuted to imprisonment for  life, as it appears similar submission was made  before the High Court Division but the same was not  accepted as the High Court Division found that the  death of the victim was due to asphyxia resulting  from exerting pressure on the throat, neck, head and  facial region, which was ante-mortem and homici-  dal in nature and it is ex-facie clear that the peti-  tioner strangled the victim with the intention of  causing her death and there is no circumstances that  may impel the Court to take a lenient view in com-  muting the death sentence as there is no mitigating  or extenuating circumstances on record for the pur-  pose of commutation of the death sentence, rather  all the circumstances are aggravating.    ",
      "4. As it appears the High Court Division  accepted the death reference holding that admitied-  ly on the night following 1-12-1997 the victim lives  with the petitioner in his house and the dead body  was found there and the evidence on record does not  show that the petitioner took any step for the treat-  ment of the victim at the material time when her  condition was critical and further the unexplained  and continuous abscondence of the petitioner after  the occurrence is a relevant fact under section § of  the Evidence Act which is indicative of his 'mens  rea’ in the commission of the offence and there is  also no evidence or suggestion or circumstances to  show that the other inmates, if any, of the house of  the petitioner assaulted her to death and further the  petitioner did not bring the matter of the unnatural  death of the victim to the notice of the police and  moreover the evidence on record does not indicate  that the petitioner attended the funeral rites of the  victim; further as per viscera examination reprol-  Exhibit 2, no poison was detected in the viscera o!  the victim and the opinion of the Medical Board is  that the death of the victim was due to asphyxia                    resulting from exerting pressure on the throat, neck,  head and facial region which was ante-mortem and  homicidal in nature and further the motive of killing  of the victim-wife by the husband/petitioner has  been firmly established and on the other hand the  defence ve ¢ has been found to be a  blatant f ; Moreover all the incriminating  circumstance: ove are undoubtedly inconsis-  tent with the innocence of the petitioner and the  chain of the circumstantial evidence is well-knit,  complete and unbroken and there is no missing link  in the chain of the circumstances appearing agianst  the petitioner and a; ackdrop, no other  hypothesis excepting that of the guilt of the peti-  tioner is possible.    ",
      "3. The learned counsel for the petitioner sub.  mits that the prosecution failed to prove that the  death was due to demand of dowry and the | eh  Court Division without any discussion on this point  upheld the death sentence and further the High);  Court Division, without considering that the Doctor  who conducted chemical examination, is the most   important and vital witness of this case but he ha,  not been examined; further the police, who took the  death body to the hospital, has also not been exam-  ined which creates serious doubt on the prosecution,  case regarding the identification of dead body of the  victim; moreover the petitioner was also not duly  examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure which is a mandatory provision; moreover  it is also evident form the record (postmortem report)  that the age of the victim was 20 years and so the age  of the condemned prisoner may be similar or a bit  more and accordingly considering the tender age of  the petitioner, the sentence of death may be commuted to sentence of imprisonment for life.    ",
      "2. The prosecution case, in short, is that  Khodeja Bibi alias Komola, the victim, was given  marriage to the petitioner who, after the marriage,    * Jail Petition No. 19 of 2007.    (From the judgment and order dated 22-11-2005  passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference  No.112 of 2003).                  stated maltreating her for money and as a result the  relationship between them beeame strained and on  the night following 1-12-1997 at about 12-30 O'  clock, Saaduddin, the father the father of the peti-  tioner and one Shajal came to the house of the PW  2, the father of the victim, and told him that the con-  dition of the victim was critical and then PW 2  rushed to the house of Saaduddin and found the vic-  tim dead and though PW 1 was finger marks on the  throat of the victim but it was given out that the vic-  tim had committed suicide by taking poison and so  PW 2 lodged Unnatural Death Case No.13 of 1997;  after holding the inquest on the dead body of the vic-  tim, the same was sent to the hospital for autopsy  where autopsy was held but opinion on autopsy was  withheld pending receipt of the viscera examination  reprot; then viscera examination reprot was received  with the opinion that no poison was detected and the  Medical Board opined that the death of the victim  was due to asphyxia resulting from exerting pres-  sure on the throat, neck, head and facial region of  the victim which was ante-mortem and homicidal in  nature. The police, after investigation, submitted-  charge sheet against the petitioner under section 302  of the Penal Code. At the commencement of the trial  of the case, the petitioner was charged under section  302 of the Penal Code but the same could not be  read over and explained to him because of his  abscondence and for the abscondence of the peti-  tioner ultimately the trial case had to be concluded  in absentia. The defence plea, as it appears from the  trend of cross-examination of the prosecution wit-  nesses, is that the victim committed suicide by tak-  ing poison in the house of the petitioner and the peti-  tioner is not responsible for her death and the had  been falsely implicated in the case out of oblique  motive. After conclusion of the trial, the learned  Sessions Judge Moulvibazar, by judgment and order  dated 20-9-2003 convicted the petitioner under sec-  tion 302 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to  death and then made the reference to the High Court  Division under section 374 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure. The High Court Division, after hearing,  accepted the reference upholding the sentence of  death.    "

      "12. We are mindful of the fact that during  investigation by police usually the Court does not  interfere under section 561A of the Code of  Criminal Procedure, but in the present case, in view  of the facts and circumstances as noticed above, we  consider it a fit case to interfere at the stage of police  investigation to prevent the abuse of the process of  the Court and to secure the ends of justice.    ",
      "11. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances  of the case and in light of the discussions made  above, we are of the view that no prima facie case  was made out against the respondent in the first  information report and the District Anti-Corruption  Officer, Gazipur without examining the necessary  papers of the authority (IPSA) specially bill No.4  dated 29-10-1994 lodged the first information report  on 31-12-1994.    ",
      "10. In the above facts and circumstances of the  case, the leamed Additional Attorney General found  it difficult to support the lodging of first information  report against the respondent.    ",
      "9. The learned Counsel for the respondent  submits that bill Nos.1-3 are all running bills and in  pill No.4, the respondent clearly stated that inadver-  tently sub-soil testing was included in bill No.3 and  regretted for the inadvertence and further requested  the authority to adjust the amount from bill No.4,  The learned Counsel further submits that after com-  pletion of entire work of the project when the final  pill would be submitted, the authority (IPSA) would  be at liberty to adjust/deduct any excess amount if  paid to the respondent in making payment against  munning bills.    ",
      "8. The first information report was lodged on  31-12-1994 that is long after the submission of bill  No.4 dated 29-10-1994 stating the inadvertent mis-  take in bill No.3 and further requesting the authori-  ty to adjust from bill No. 4 and excess amount  drawn in bill No.3                  ",
      "7. ‘It appears from bill No.4 dated October  29,1994 submitted by the respondent that in run  bill No.3 inadvertently they billed against sub-soil  investigation which were already included in Design  and Tendering phase bill and they regretted very  much for the mistake and in bill No.4 necessary cor-  rections were accordingly made. It was further men-  tioned in bill No.4 that if any amount against sub-  soil investigation was paid separately, the same may  be adjusted in bill No.4.    ",
      "6. The allegations against the respondent is  that the respondent took the money for fifty one  bore holes relating to topographic survey by bill  Nos.1 and 2 respectively dated 11-3-1994 and 19-5.  1994 and she took the same amount of money for  the same work by bill No.3 dated 30-6-1994,    ",

Leave was granted to consider the submis-  sion that when a very strong prima facie case was  made out in the first information report as to an  offence punishable under sections 409/109 of the  Penal Code read with section 5(2) of Act II of 1947  and the case was under investigation and the inves-  tigating officer was collecting materials, the High  Court Division was not justified in quashing the  entire proceeding and as such the same is illegal and  the submission that the consistent decisions of the  Appellate Division of the Supreme Court is against  the quashment of any proceeding during investiga-  tion by the police but by ignoring the consistent  view of the Appellate Division, the High Court  Division most illegally quashed the proceeding at  the stage of investigation.

      "2. Short facts are that one Md Golam  Mostafa, District Anti-Corruption Officer, Gazipur  lodged first information report with Joydebpur  Police Station alleging, inter alia, that accused Latif  Newaz Waliur Rahman, Executive Engineer,  Institute of Post Graduate Studies in Agriculture,  (shortly IPSA), Gazipur and Mrs Lailun Nahar  Ekram, the respondent in collusion with each other  for illegal gain misappropriated Taka 11,80,615 by  false billing against consultancy service and thereby  committed an offence punishable under section  409/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of  Act II of 1947 .

",
      "4. Mr Mansur Habib, learned Advocate,  appearing for the petitioner submitted that the High  Court Division failed to consider that the trial Court  directed to issue letter for sanction for prosecution of  the accused public servants and the sanction was not  accorded by the Government within the period of 60)  days of the Order No.1 dated 12-9-2001 of the trial  Court, the trial Court is entrusted to proceed with the  case under section 6(5) of the Criminal Law  Amendment Act, 1958 considering that sanction was                  deemed to have been obtained to prosecute the accused public servants, The leamed Advocate further submitted that the order sheet of the proceeding showed that the Court directed to accord sanction on 12-9-2001 and the Government did not accord sanction to prosecute against the accused public servant within 60 days and after lapse of 60 days the trial Court had the jurisdiction to proceed with the case in holding that the Govemment failed to send sanction to prosecute the accused public servants within 60 days and after lapse of 60 days of the period sought for sanction the same  nave been deemed to have been asserted and the trial Court could have proceeded in holding that the sanction was obtained after lapse of 60 days.    Mr TH Khan, learned Counsel, appearing for  the respondent Nos.2-3 submitted that the High  Court Division held rightly that the respondents  could not be prosecuted without sanction of the  Government and in this case, Government did not  give sanction for prosecution and accordingly, the  High Court Division have held that the complainant  Jodged the complaint against the respondents  describing them as public servants and offences  alleged against them are under sections 166/168/  467/468/477 and 420 of the Penal Code and under  section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,    1974 . The case is triable under the provisions of    Criminal Law Amendment Act and under section  6(5) of the said Act sanction of the Government is  required for the prosecution of public servants for an  offence mentioned in the schedule of the act. As the  Government refused to accord sanction to prosecute  the aforesaid respondents, the learned Judges of the  High Court Division discharged the Rule. The  learned Counsel finally submitted that the High  Court Division dismissed the judgment of the  leamed Senior Special Judge found that the hearing  dated of the Special Case No.13 of 2001 was fixed  on 15-1-2002 and on that date order of the  Government refusing to accord sanction was  received and as such, the High Court Division find-  ing no illegality in the judgment of the learned  Senior Special Judge discharged the Rule.    ",
      "3. Leave was granted to consider the submis-  sions of the learned Advocate for the appellant that  \"the record shows from the date of writing to the  Government for according sanction to take cog.  nizance against the accused who were public ser.  vants, 60 days expired and accordingly as per provi-  sions of section 6(5) of the Criminal Lay  Amendment Act, 1958 it will be deemed that sane-  tion was duly accorded but the learned Senior  Special Judge did not follow the mandatory provi-  sions of law and accordingly, refused to take cog.  nizance against the public servants. He further sub-  mitted that sub-section 5 of section 6 of the Criminal  Law Amendment Act, 1958 provides that where the  complaint is not accompanied by such sanction, the  Special Judge shall, immediately on receipt of the  complaint or report, address, by letter, the  Government in the matter, and if the required sanc-  tion is neither received nor refused within six  of the receipt of the letter by the Government, such  sanction shall be deemed to have duly accorded. He  finally submitted that the High Court Division com-  mitted an error of law in holding that the learned  Special Judge did not commit any illegality in not  taking cognizance against the accused public ser-  vant after the expiry of 60 days from the writing to  the Government for sanction of prosecution.\"    ",
      "2. The prosecution case, in short, is that the  appellant as complainant filed a petition of com-  plaint against the accused-persons alleging, inter  alia, that they committed an offence of forgery,  interpolation, wrongful gain and criminal miscon-  duct. The learned Senior Special Judge, Sunamganj  on receipt of the petition of complaint examined the  complainant under section 200 of the Code of  Criminal Procedure and registered the case as  Special Case No.13 of 2001 and passed an order  writing to the Government for sanction as out of 10  accused 6 were public servants fixing 25-11-2001  for further order. On 25-11-2001 the District Anti-  Corruption Bureau, Sunamganj filed an application  praying for time for submitting the order of sanction  and the case was accordingly fixed on 15-1-2002 for  receipt of the order of sanction, if any. On 10-1-2002  an application was filed by the complainant peti-  tioner stating, infer alia, that since 60 days already  expired from the date of writing to the authority for  sanction but the sanction had not yet been received,  proceeding should be started against the public ser-  vants also as after the expiry of 60 days it will be  deemed that the sanction was duly accorded. The  learned Senior Special Judge fixed the application  for hearing on the date already fixed earlier i.e. 15-  1-2002 . On 15-1-2002 a letter dated 15-1-2002 was  received from the Prime Minister's Office through    Fax of the Office of Deputy Commissioner intimat.  ing that sanction for prosecution of the public ser.  vants was not accorded. The Senior Special Judge  accordingly refused to take cognizance against the  public servants as sanction was refused. Being  aggrieved the complainant moved the High Cour  Division and obtained the Rule but the Rule was dis.  charged by the High Court Division.    ",

But having regard to the facts and circum-  stances of the case, the rule issued in respect of the  order dated 10-4-2008 passed by the Druto Bichar  Tribunal No.2, Dhaka, is discharged, since not  amendable under section 561A of the Code of  Criminal Procedure and the order of transfer of the  said case of the Metropolitan Additional Sessions  Judge for disposal shall remain unaffected.

      "8. It appears that the application under section  561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as framed  and filed, and the rule as issued, on which the  impugned judgment and order of the High Court  Division has been passed discharging the rule. do  not have any nexus with each other. The rule as  issued and decided upon the application filed under  section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is  misconceived and same is not maintainable under  section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.    ",
      "7. However the High Court Division as it  appears, has missed the fact   transferred to the Metropolitan Additios  Judge for disposal in compliance to a judgment and  order passed by the High Court Division, which fact  is absent in the case reported in 60 DLR (AD) 185,  and hence said decision is not applicable in the  instant case. A judgment of the High Court Division  cannot be frustrated by any executive order. The  order for transfer of the case to the Druto Bichar  Tribunal has been made by an executive order. Any  judgment passed by the High Court Division is  binding on all as per our Constitution and the subor-  dinate courts are duty bound to comply with such  judgment.    ",
      "6. The High Court Division as it appears has  failed to consider that the order dated 10-4-2008 of  the Tribunal considered by the High Court Division  is not entertainable under section 561A of the Code  of Criminal Procedure and hence the rule, as quoted  in the impugned judgment of the High Court  Division, ought not to have been issued.    ",
      "5. It appears that the High Court Division  relying on a decision of the High Court Division in  the case of Abdul Kader Mirza vs Bangladesh,  reported in 60 DLR (AD) 185, held that the provi-  sions of sections 5 and 6 of the Druto Bichar  Tribunal Ain authorizes the Government to transfer  the case to a Tribunal for expeditious disposal and  such transfer is not hit by the principle of equality  before law or equal protection before the law inas-  much as the same is applicable to the trial of offence  or classes of offence without discrimination and that  the High Court Division in such premise cannot  allow any argument challenging the legality and  propriety of the government in transferring the case  in reference to the Druto Lichar Tribunal.    ",
      "4. On perusal of the application filed under  section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure,  registered as Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5373  of 2008, we do not find any nexus in between the  prayer made in the application under section 561A  of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the subject  matter ie. the Rule decided by the impugned judg-  ment and order, In the application the petitioner  prayed for quashing the proceedings of the  Metropolitan Sessions Case No.2280 of 2007 pend-  ing in the Court of Metropolitan Additional Sessions  Judge, Ist Court, Dhaka, whereas the impugned  judgment and order relates to the order dated 10-4-  2008 passed by the Druto Bichar Tribunal No.2,  Dhaka in Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No.7 of 2008  allowing transfer of the case to the Druto Bichar  Tribunal from the Court of Metropolitan Additional  Sessions Judge despite the judgment and order  passed by the High Court Division in Criminal  Miscellaneous case No:15466 of 2007 directing the  trial of the case by the Metropolitan Additional  Sessions Judge.    ",
      "3. It appears from the impugned order passed  by the High Court Division dated 3-3-2009 that the  Rule was issued calling upon the opposite party to  show cause as to why the order dated 10-4-2008  passed by the Druto Bichar Tribunal Nos.2, Dhaka,  in Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No.7 of 2008 should  not be quashed.                  ",
      "2. Relevant facts are that the accused pet.  tioner was facing trial in Sessions Case No.2280 of  2007 arising out of Uttara Police Station Case No.4  dated 28-8-2006 under sections 302/34 of the Pena}  Code corresponding to GR No.375 of 2006 . The  case was pending before the Metropolitan Sessions  Judge, Dhaka, and that on an application filed under  Section 526 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,  before the High Court Division, registered as  Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.15466 of 2007, the  High Court Division was pleased to transfer the case  to the Ist Court of Metropolitan Additional Sessions  Judge, Dhaka, for trial but in the meantime the  Ministry of Home Affairs by gazette notification  transferred the case to Druto Bichar Tribunal No.3,  Dhaka, for disposal of the case. Accordingly the  Metropolitan Sessions Judge transferred the case tot  he said Tribunal No.3 but on receipt of the order of  the High Court Division transferring the case to the  Court of Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge.  Ist Court, Dhaka, said Tribunal No.3 transferred the  case record to the said Metropolitan Additional  Sessions Judge, Ist Court, Dhaka, and accordingly  on receipt of the record the Metropolitan Additional  Sessions Judge framed charge on 21-1-2008 and  fixed date for evidence and thereafter on 2-4-2008  the Additional Public Prosecutor filed an application  before the Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judge  to transfer the case to Druto Bichar Tribunal No.2.  Dhaka, pursuant to a gazette notification issued by  the Ministry of Home Affairs and accordingly the  case has been transferred to the Druto Bichar  Tribunal No.2; where the case has been registered as  Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No.7 of 2008.

      "45. Under the circumstances, we are of the    opinion that the notice dated 18-2-2007, issued by    Secretary to the Commission, was without any law-    ful authority, as such, void and any proceeding    based on the said void notice is a nullity in the eye    of law.        ",
      "44. Besides, the notice dated 18-2-2007 was    not a notice required by law, the notice directed the    respondent No.1, a detenu, to submit return of his    assets within a period of 72 hours, is itself a worst    example of arbitrary action on the part of the con-    cerned authority. A notice must allow a reasonable    time to check-up the details of the assets of a person,    if necessary, on examination of his records and after    consultation with his lawyers and other concerned    persons. Section 26 certainly does not envisage a    notice upon a person who is in detention and he is    not expected to give any details of his assets within    the time specified. The person concerned must be    afforded a fair and reasonable opportunity to    respond to the notice, otherwise, it is no notice in the    eye of law. A notice issued under section 26 of the    Act to a detenu, away from his hearth and home,    cannot be said to be a fair and bonafide exercise of    power.        ",
      "42. Besides, section 26 envisages that before    issuance of the notice, the Commissioner(s) must be    satisfied about the allegation. It is their satisfaction    and of nobody elses. But by sub-section (2) of sec-    tion 18, the Commissioners can only ratify the ‘sat-    isfaction' of the Secretary which is certainly not stip-    ulated in section 26,        h, the notice dated 1-2-2007, issued    by the Secretary in favour of the respondent l,    was not issued on behalf of the Commission as    envisaged under section 26, and is without jurisdic-    tion and void abinitio.        ",
      "41. In the present case, the notice dated 18-2-        2007, under section 26 of the Act, was issued by the    Secretary of the Commission but he does not repre-    sent the Commission, he is only one of its employ-    ees, to carry out the decision of the Commission.    But at the relevant time there were no    Commissioners, as such apparently, the Secretary    issued the notice on 18-2-2007, on his own, without    any Satisfaction and decision from the Commission,    in violation of section 26 of the Act. The concerned    authorities on realizing this error, tried to cover it up    by inserting sub-section (2) in section 18 on 18-4-    2004, by Ordinance No. VII of 2007 . Sub-section    (2) provides for ex post facto ratification of the acts    done by the officers of the Commission during the    period from 7-2-2007 to 24-2-2007, without any    authorization from the Commission, but the ques-    tion of jurisdiction goes to the root of the matter. If    any person acts beyond his authority, to the preju-    dice of any person, such acts cannot be ratified or    validated by post facto legislation, his action    remains void.        ",
      "40. This section unmistakably provides that    before issuance of any such notice the Commission    must be ‘satisfied’ that the concerned person owns or    is in possession of the properties beyond his known    source of income through illegal means. This 'satis-    faction’ must be of the Commission itself constitut-    ed of no other person than its Commissioners. The    relevant order to submit assets may be issued by any    of its authorised officials but the decision to issue    such an order must be recorded by the    Commissioner(s).        ",
      "39. Section 26 provides for declaration of    assets. Sub-section (1) reads as follows :            The section provides that if the Commission is    satisfied (19% &) that a person has in his possession    assets beyond his known source of income through    illegal means then the Commission by an order in                      writing (Oa RA SAMA, AVS OMT WAL.)    direct the said person to submit the description of all    his assets and liabilities.        ",
      "38. The Commission, under section 18 of the    Act, exercises its various powers subject to and    under the Act through its Commissioners or through    its officers, as duly empowered in this behalf.        ",
      "37. It appears that all the Commissioners    resigned from the Commission on 7-2-2007 and it    was reconstituted on 24-2-2007, as such, although    the Commission existed as an Institution on 18-2.    2007, when the notice was issued, but there was no    Commission within the meaning of section 3 read    with section 5 of the Act on that date.        ",
      "36. It may be recalled that after Proclamation    of Emergency in the country on 11-1!-2007, the        respondent No.1 was arrested by the joint forces oy    3-2-2007, under the provisions of rule 16 of the    Emergency Powers Rules, 2007, and while he Was    in such custody, he was put under detention unde,    the provisions of the Special Powers Act. While jp    such detention, the Secretary of the Commission    issued a notice dated 18-2-2007 under the proyj.    sions of sections 18 and 26 of the Act. This notice    was served upon the respondent No.1 on 20-2-2007,    It directed him to submit his statement of assets    within 72 hours.        ",
      "35. However, the case was a nullity from the    very beginning. This legal position ought to have    considered by the learned Special Judge while dis-    posing of the petition filed under section 241A of    the Code.        ",
      "34. On the basis of the discussions made    above, we are unable to agree with the learned    Judges of the High Court Division that the Special    Judge committed any illegality in taking cognizance    of the offence without sanction from the    Commission purportedly under section 32(1) of the    Act. As a matter of fact the requirement of sub-sec-    tion (1) of section 32 was complied with when the    charge sheet was filed along with a copy of the sanc-    tion from the Commission. As such, there was no    illegality in taking cognizance by the learned Judge    of the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge.        ",
      "33. In due course, the Judge of the    Metropolitan Senior Special Judge, Dhaka, took    cognizance of the offences against the respondent    No.1 on 6-5-2007, as envisaged under sub-section    (1) of section 32 . Thereafter, the case was trans-    ferred to the Court of Special Judge, Court No.3, for    trial. On 27-5-2007, charge was framed against the    respondent No.1 after rejection of his petition for    discharge of the charges under section 241A of the    Code.        ",
      "32. It that an officer of the    Commission conducted an investigation into the    allegations lodged against the respondent No.1 and    after obtaining sanction from the Commission, sub-    mitted the charge sheet on 29-4-2007 and a supple-    mentary charge sheet on 21-5-2007 . This is in due    compliance of sub-section (2) of section 32 read    with sub rule (1) of rule 13, sub-rule (4) and sub-rule    (7) of rule 15 of the Rules.        ",
      "31. In the instant case, an officer of the    Commission lodged a first information report on 6-    3-2007 with the Tejgaon Police Station and a case    was started, This is not envisaged under rules 3 and    4 of the Rules. Those rules provide only for filing of    the complaint involving the offences mentioned in                      the Schedule to the Act. However, those provisions    are merely directory and deviation from provisions    in lodging an first information report instead of a    complaint, would not vitiate the proceedings.        ",
      "30. The High Court Division, however, on con-    sideration sub-rule (7) of rule 15 of the Fife wR    fafearn, 2004 (the Rules) held that sanction is    required to be filed at the time of institution of the    case (STWAl AIHA C#TH) on the erroneous under-    standing that sanction shall also be required at the    time of lodging an first information report. But as a    matter of fact, the Act as well as the Rules do not    envisage lodging of any first information report but    only a complaint (SfSta) either under rule 3 or    tule 4 of the Rules and no sanction is required to file    any complaint.        ",
      "29. Under the above amended section, after    completion of the investigation, the investigating    officer, under sub-section (2) of section 32, on    obtaining the sanction from the Commission, would    submit the police report before the Court along with    a copy of the letter of sanction. The Court, under    sub-section (1), would take cognizance, only when    there is such sanction from the Commission. Both    the sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of the section    32 envisages only one sanction, not two. Sub-sec-    tion (1) does not spell out or even envisage filing of    any fresh sanction when the sanction to prosecute    has already been filed along with the charge sheet of    the investigating officer. It only envisages that with-    out such sanction from the Commission (#7    wACAAA fSeat*) as spelt out in sub-section (2), no    Court shall take cognizance of the offence (@F    SRS ot ora SAA cA Gert od STA     Sats Ft) under sub-section (1) of section 32.        ",
      "27. The High Court Division, however, mis-    conceived the amended section 32 also in holding    that sanction from the Commission will be required    under sub-section (1) of section 32 . This is not so.    There is no provision for according the sanction    twice-over. Sanction from the Commission will be    required when the charge sheet is filed under sub-    section (2) and on receipt of the charge sheet along    with a copy of the letter of sanction the Court takes    cognizance of the offence for trial, either under the    original section 32 or the amended section 32 . As a    matter of fact, only one sanction will be required    under section 32, unamended or amended.                ",
      "26. Under the circumstances, the irresistible    conclusion is that no sanction will be required to file    a complaint (SfScu) either with the Commission or    with the police, But sanction from the Commission    shall be required both under the unamended and the    amended section 32, before institution of a case    (ATS AICHCAA CHT) in the concerned Court.        ",
      "25. From the above discussions, it will be clear    that the words “31 ¥Itwz\" means institution of a    case by submission ofa charge sheet by an officer of    the Commission, before the concerned Court and    certainly not an first information report as envisaged    under section 154 of the Code of Criminal    Procedure or a complaint (@fScmt) as envisaged    under rule 3 and rule 4 of the Rules.        ",
      "24. Sub-ule (4) of rule 15 stipulates that only    in case of submission of charge sheet (SfSeusTATT    wma CNM HAA), prior sanction from the    Commission will required,        ",
      "23. Rule 14 envisages that for filing of a com    plaint with the offices of the Commission or for                      lodging the same with the police, no sanction will be    required.        ",
      "20. The investigation of the allegations men-    tioned in the schedule will conducted, under section    20 of the Act, by an officer of the Commission,    assigned for that purpose.                ",
      "18. Let us first examine the scheme of the    Rules.                ",
      "17. Section 34 of the Act provides for framing    of the Rules in order to fulfill the purpose of the Act.        Accordingly, the Rules were framed on 29-3-2997        ",
      "16. The High Court Division, however, misin-    terpreted section 32 of the Act, the original as well    as the amended one, in holding that a sanction by the    Commission is required before lodging an FIR. The    High Court Division, further misconceived the    amended section 32 and wrongly held that a further    sanction is required to take cognizance of the    offence by the Court in spite of the sanction given    earlier under sub-section (2) of section 32 of the Act.    But as a matter of fact, no sanction is required to file    a complaint (Sférat) and the unamended as well as    the amended section 32 requires only one sanction    from the Commission. Now let us consider section    32 along with the connected Rules.        Section 32 (unamended) reads as follows :    <br>    The confusion is in respect of the words appearing in two places in the above    section, It may be argued that the above words mean    ‘lodging of the first information report’, It is not so.    It means at least so far this Act is concerned, the    formal initiation of the prosecution on submission of    the charge sheet before the Court.        ",
      "15. We do not find any reason to disagree with    those findings of fact arrived at by the High Court    Division, in allowing the appeal and setting aside    the order of conviction and sentence passed by the    Special Judge, Court, No.3, Dhaka.        ",
      "14. It appears that in respect of the valuation of    various immovable properties, FDRs and cash in    hand or in bank accounts, as furnished by the    respondent No.1, in response to the notice under    section 26(2) of the Act, the High Court Division, in    disagreeing with the findings of the learned Special    Judge, held that there is no evidence that the appel-    lant procured any of those assets, movable or    immovable, beyond his known source of income    through illegal means.                      ",
      "13. We have considered the Judgments and    Orders passed by the learned Special Judge as well    as that of the High Court Division. We have also    heard the learned Advocates for both the sides.        ",
      "12. So far the finding of the learned Special    Judge that the respondent No.1 concealed the FDRs    worth Taka 1.17 crore is concerned, the High Court    Division, on evidence, found that the appellant fur-    nished various sources for his FDRs, which was not    controverted by the prosecution, as such, held that    the findings of the learned Special Judge in this    Tespect is not correct.        ",
      "11. The learned Special Judge held further that    although the respondent No.1 had huge amount of    balance in his accounts kept in different banks. he    disclosed only Taka 90,000 in his statement of assets     but the High Court Division on the contrary found    on evidence that the appellant does not have any bal-    ance in the accounts which contradict the amounts    mentioned in his statement of assets or the income    tax returns furnished by him.        ",
      "10. Regarding the lands at Kachua, the High    Court Division, found that the learned Special Judge    without giving any reasoning held that the respon-    dent No.1 concealed an amount in respect of the said    lands at Kachua, rather, on appreciation of evidence,    the High Court Division, held that there is no con-    cealment of assets in his statement.        ",
      "9. Regarding the filling station, the High    Court Division, on the basis of the depositions of    PWs 30 and 33, found that the learned Special Judge    acted illegally in not considering the deposition of    PW 33 that the filling station is not owned by the        respondent No.1 and held that there is no evidence    that he procured any of the assets beyond his known    source of income through illegal means.        ",
      "8. Regarding the ground floor of the house    known as Sultana Bhaban, the High Court Division    on the basis of the depositions of PWs 1, 30, 33 and    37 disagreed with the findings of the learned Special    Judge that the respondent No.1 concealed any    amount in his statement in respect of the said house.        ",
      "7. appears from the Judgment of the High    Court Division that the learned Additional Attorney-    General conceded that the learned Special Judge    was wrong in holding that the respondent No.1 con-    cealed any amount in respect of his Comilla house.    It also appears that the learned Advocate appearing    on behalf of the Commission did not make any sub-    mission in respect of the house of the respondent    No.1 at Comilla.        ",
      "6. Regarding the house at Comilla, the    jearned Special Judge disbelieved the contention    raised on behalf of the respondent No.1 that the said    house was constructed with the advance obtained    from the Agrani Bank, on the basis of the deposi-    tions adduced by the officials of the PWD and found    the allegations of concealment proved agianst him.    But the High Court Division found on re-apprecia-    tion of evidence that the findings of the learned    Special Judge is contrary to the evidence on record.        ",
      "16.  held that he concealed the excess cost for con-    id house. But the High Court    division did not consider them either independent    ore  father, found their valuation    unreliable. The High Court Division, on the other    hand, relied on the depositions given by the offi    of the Tax Department and Exhibit 12 which were    completely ignored by the leamed Special Judge    and set aside its findings in this respect, holding that    the learned Special Judge committed illegality in    treating the PWD officials as neutral.            ",
      "5. Regarding the allegation of concealment of    valuation of the house of the respondent No.1 at    Banani, the learned Special Judge, on the basis of                      the depositions of the PWD officials and Exhibit.    ",
      "4. On appeal, the High Court Division,    allowed the appeal, both on merit as well as on    points of law and set aside the order of conviction    and sentence passed by the Special Judge.        ",
      "3. The learned Special Judge, on examination    of witnesses and other evidence on record, found the    respondent No.1 guilty of the charges of concealing    various amounts and possessing those beyond his    known source of income and on those findings, by    his Judgment and Order dated 26-7-2007, convicted    and sentenced him to suffer simple imprisonment    for 3 years under section 26(2) of the Act read with    tule SGha(5) of the Emergency Powers Rules, 2007    and rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten) years under    section 27(1) of the Act and'to pay a fine of Taka    10,00,000 (Taka ten lac), in default, to suffer 1(one)    year imprisonment more and also forfeited his prop-    erties.        ",
      "2. The facts leading to the filing of this peti-    tion are that the Secretary of the Anti-Corruption    Commission (in short the 'Commission') issued a    notice on 18-2-2007 under section 26(1) of qrifs    WAR fei GIZA, 2008 (V of 2004) (the 'Act’) upon    the respondent No.1, while he was under detention,    asking him to submit a statement of his assets and    liabilities. On receipt of the said notice, he filed his    statement on 20-2-2007, and subsequently, he filed        another supplementary statement on 24-4-2007, Oy    6-3-2007, a first information report was lodged    against the respondent No.1, narrating various alle.    gations of acquiring movable and immovable prop.    ertics by abuse of power, and a case was recorded    under sections 26 and 27 of the Act, section 409 of    the Penal Code, section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 and    rules 15, 15Ka, 1SKha, 15Gha(5) of the Emergency    Powers Rules, 2007 . After investigation, charge.    sheet No.189 was submitted on 29-4-2007 before    the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge, Dhaka, with    due sanction from the Commission. The learned    Senior Special Judge, Dhaka, took cognizance of the    offence and sent the case to the Third Court of    Special Judge, for trial. A supplementary charge-    sheet was also submitted on 21-5-2007 against the    respondent No.1, bringing the allegation of conceal-    ment of total Taka 3,27,88,465 which he allegedly    acquired beyond his known legal source of income    and the learned Special Judge framed Charge under    sections 26(2) and 27(1) of the Act read with rule    15Gha(5) of the Emergency Power Rules, 2007.        ",
      "1. ABM Khairul Haque J : This is a petition for    leave to appeal, filed on behalf of the Anti-    Corruption Commission, against the Judgment and    Order dated 13-7-2009, passed by the High Court    Division in Criminal Appeal No.4393 of 2007,    allowing the appeal and setting aside the Judgment    and Order passed by the Special Judge, Court No.3,    Dhaka, in Special Case No.1 of 2007, in convicting    and sentencing the respondent No.1, Dr Mohiuddin    Khan Alamgir.

      "  Article 142        Parliament though may amend the Constitu-    tion under Article 142 but cannot make the Cons-    titution subservient to any other Proclamations    etc. or cannot disgrace it in any manner since the    Constitution is the embodiment and solemn    expression of the will of the people of    Bangladesh, attained through the supreme sacri-    fice of nearly three million martyrs. The Parlia-    ment, by amendment of the Constitution cannot    legitimize any illegitimate activity.        The Parliament cannot ratify and validate    those unconstitutional acts of usurpers as the    Parliament is not supreme over everything else    like the Parliament of the United Kingdom,    rather it is independent of other organs of the    State, but it certainly operates within certain    parameters under the Constitution.      <br>  Constitution—Supreme Law    <br>    Since the Constitution is the Supreme law of    the land and the Martial Law Proclamations,    Regulations and Orders promulgated made by    the usurpers, being illegal, void and non-est in    the eye of law, could not be ratified or confirmed        *Civil Petition for live to Appeal Nos. 1044 & 1045 of    2009.    (From the judgment and order dated 29th August        passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 6016    of 2000.

Accordingly    Martial Law is unconstitutional and illegal ang it    is a mischievous device not founded in any Jay    known in Bangladesh and by Martial Law the    whole nation is hijacked by some people with the    support of the armed forces and the whole nation    goes into a state of siege; it is like that the whole    nation and “We, the people of Bangladesh”, are    taken hostage and further like a hostage-taking    situation, the hostage takers themselves recog.    nize that there is a superior law than their    weapons which “We, the people” put in their    hands to serve us and they recognize that there    are two impediments to their taking over power    or assuming power, first, the Constitution itself    and so they, at first, start by saying “Notwith-    standing anything in the Constitution” because    they recognize that the Constitution is superior    but they choose to brush it aside. The second    impediment to Martial Law is the Superior    Court of the Republic entrusted with the solemn    duty to “preserve, protect and defend the Cons-    titution” and so every Martial Law, immediately    upon Proclamation seeks to curb the powers of    the Court, particularly, the powers of the Cons-    titutional Court.    <br>    Doctrine of necessity  <br>      Doctrine of State necessity is no magic wand:    It does not make an illegal act a legal one, But the    Court in exceptional circumstances, in order (0    avert the resultant evil of illegal legislations, may    condone such illegality on the greater interest of    the community in general but on condition that                      those acts could have been legally done at least by    the proper authority, authority (210)    <br>    Doctrine of Severability    <br>    While declaring any law ultra vires, the    Court often applies the doctrine of severability to    limit the application of the judicial verdict, This    is no legislative act though such a decision modi-    fies or even destroys a legi  ",

      "153. We, while deciding the power of the   Court of judicial review, found that the High Court   Division has the jurisdiction to decide as to whether   any act or legislative measure made by any authori-   ty not competent to do so and/or such act or legisla-   tive measure made/done otherwise than in accor-   dance with the procedure prescribed by the   Constitution and/or are repugnant to the provisions   of Constitution.

As will be evident from the case of SR   Bommai vs Union of India (supra) which we have   dismissed earlier, in the original Constitution of   India enacted in the year 1949 there was no mention   of secularism and socialism. Then in the year 1976   “socialist” and “secular” were incorporated in the   Constitution of India by the 42th Amendment. In -   this regard in the above case Ramasyem, J held as   follows:—   <br>   \" The Constitution has cho-   sen secularism as its vehicle to establish an   egalitarian social order. I am respectfully in   agreement with our brethren Sawant and Jeevan   Reddy, JJ. In this respect.

From the contents of the proceeding of   the Constitutional Assembly it appears that for days   claborate discussion was made in respect of secular-   ism, nationalism and socialism and then those were   incorporated at Chapter 11 of our Constitution,   which contained the fundamental principles of State   Policy.      ",
      "150. As it appears the High Court Division   gave detail reasons for not condoning the omission   of secularism as was provided in original preamble,   Articles 8(1), 12 and other connected changes made   in the Constitution in this regard. The High Court   Division similarly did not also condone the substitu-   tion of Articles 6, S(1), 9 and other connected   Articles of the original Constitution, which dealt   With nationalism, socialism and connected matters.      ",
      "149. The High Court Division then concluded   as follows:   <br>   We have discussed above the various provisions   of the Constitution. Those provisions were not only   the basic features of the Constitution but were also      the ideals for the struggle for liberation, the corner   stone of our Constitution. Those ideals were the.    basis for the birth of the Republic of Bangladesh   But those basic features of the Consttitution were   changed by the various Martial Law Proclamations   <br>      <br>      Those Martial Law Proclamation Orders   of   1975, 1976 and 1977 were incorporated in   Fourth Schedule to the Constitution by its amen   ment as Paragraph 3A. The English versions of the   provisions discussed above were changed, deleted   and modified by the Proclamations (Amendment   Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977   The Bengali versions of those very Provisions were   subsequently added, deleted or amended by The   Second Proclamations (Fifteenth Amendment)   Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of   1978).   <br>   In pursuance to the above Order the original   Bengali text of the part of the Preamble, Articles 6,   8, 9, 10, 12, 25(2) and the Proviso to Article 38 were   amended on the false pretext of persistent demand to   repeal the undemocratic provisions although the   aforesaid provisions are all the glorious basic fea-   tures of the Constitution and had no nexus with the   Fourth Amendment. All these changes of the basic   structures of the Constitution were sought to be rat-   ified, confirmed and validated by the Fifth   Amendment apparently by playing fraud upon the   members of the Second Parliament.      The pretexts to amend the Constitution in the   above manner in the garb of repealing the undemo-   cratic provisions of the Constitution incorporated   therein by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment)   Act, 1975, was altogether misconceived. Firstly   because the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.   whatever its political merits or demerits, it W4   brought about by the representatives of the people   by an overwhelming majority members of a sover-   eign Parliament. Secondly, however undemocratic   the Fourth Amendment may appear to an army com-   mander, the amendment of the Constitution, could   CMLA or   any person, how high so ever, but only by a   Parliament. Thirdly, Major General Ziaur Rahman                   being an usurper to the Office of the President and   in the Office of the legally non-existent Chief   Administrator, had no authority to   change the Constitution, As an Officer of the   Defence Services, he took oath to protect the   constitution of Bangladesh, but instead, on April 23,   1977, only two days after assuming the office of   president, he illegally and without any lawful   authority amended the various provisions of the   Constitution which Were the fundamental basis for   the struggle for liberation, by the Proclamation   Order No. 1 of 1977 and the Second Proclamation   Order No. IV of 1978, and made the secular   Republic of Bangladesh, a theocratic State, thereby   the cause of the liberation War of Bangladesh was   betrayed.   <br><br>   By virtue of the above two Proclamation Orders   all the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs were vali-   dated and were entered in the Fourth Schedule to the   Constitution as paragraphs 3A and 6B while para-   graph 6A was inserted there earlier by Second   Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976 . Since it was   known that in the face of the Constitution, those   amendments would be void ab initio, as such,   amendment of the Constitution itself was made in a   bid to validate those Proclamations etc. by the Fifth   Amendment.      ",
      "148. The High Court Division then quoting the   original Article 38 of the Constitution and its provi-   so as shown in the above chart, which was one of the   fundamental rights, and the omission of the above   proviso by. the Second Proclamation (Sixth   Amendment) Order 1976 held as follows:—   <br>   With the same object to destroy the secular   character of the Republic and its Constitution,   the proviso to Article 38 was omitted by the   Second Proclamation (Sixth Amendment)   Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No.   III of 1976).      <br><br>   The above noted proviso to Article 38 was   meant to protect the secular character of the   Republic of Bangladesh in spite of one’s fundamen-   tal right to form an association as envisaged in   Article 38, but the above proviso was omitted by the   Second Proclamation Order No. III of 1976, made   by Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, a nomi-   nated President of Bangladesh and CMLA. Since   the secular character of the Republic was one of the   objectives of the struggle for liberation, the omis-   sion of the aforesaid provision from the   Constitution, as a bid or devise to change its such   basic character, tantamount to changing of the basic   feature of the Constitution.      ",
      "147. The High Court Division then quoting the   provision of original Article 25 of the Constitution   and its amended version as shown in the above chart   held as follows:   <br>   <br>   This clause-2 is redundant. The original   Article 25 itself provides for promotion of inter-   national peace, security and solidarity amongst   all the nations including of course, the Muslim   countries, in accordance with the charter of the                          United Nations. As such, its endeavor to foster   further relations amongst only with the Muslim   countries based on Islamic solidarity, as stated   in the added clause 2, can only be explained by   its leaning towards becoming an Islamic   Republic from a Secular Republic and thereby   destroying its one of the most important and sig-   nificant basic feature of our Constitution, name-   ly, secularism”.      ",
      "146. The High Court Division then quoting the   original provision of Article 12 of the Constitution   as shown in the above chart, which was omitted   from the Constitution by the Proclamation Order   No. 1 of 1977, held as follows:—   <br>   ..............................................   <br>         This provision of secularism explained and   expounded in Article 12, is one of the most   important and unique basic features of the   Constitution. Secularism means both religious   tolerance as well as religious freedom. It envis-   ages equal treatment to all irrespective of caste,   creed or religion but the State must not show   any form of tilt or leaning towards any particu-   lar religion either directly or even remotely. It   requires maintenance of strict neutrality on the   part of the State in the matters of different reli-   gions professed by various communities in the   State. The State must not seen to be favouring   any particular religion, rather, ensure protection   to the followers of all faiths without any dis-   crimination including even to an atheist. This is   what it means by the principle of secularism.   <br><br>   Secularism was one of the ideals for which   the struggle for liberation was fought and own   and the framers of the Constitution in their wis-   dom in order to dispel any confusion, upheld   and protect the said ideal of secularism as spelt   it out in Article 12 of the Constitution as one of   the fundamental principles of State Policy.   Indeed this was one of the most important basic   features of the Constitution. But the said basic   feature of the Constitution was deleted by the   Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977 and the   Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978 and   thereby sought to change the secular character   of the Republic of Bangladesh as enshrined in   the original Constitution”.      ",
      "145. The High Court Division then quoting the   provision of original Article 10 of the Constitution   and its amended version as shown in the above chart   held that original Article 10, being one of the funda-   mental ideals on which the struggle for national lib-   eration was fought, was spelt out in the Constitution   as one of its basic structures and the amended pro-   vision provides for participation of women in   national life but this is already well provided for in   Article 28, as such, this substitution was unneces-   sary and redundant. |   <br>   The High Court Division also held—   <br>   This substituted provision has no nexus   with the original provision, which spelt out   establishment of a socialistic economic system   and exploitation free society for Bangladesh.   The people of Bangladesh dreamt of such a   society for ages. In order to establish such an   idealistic society the people of Bangladesh gave                    their lives. As such, the provision containing   such idealism, very rightly found its place in the   Constitution as one of the fundamental princi-   ples of State Policy. This being one of the basis   for our struggle for liberation, this provision   was one of the basic structures of the   Constitution.   <br>   Without going into the merit of the substi-   tuted Article 10, we admit that we do not find   any plausible reason to delete such a glorious   provision for the salvation of fellow human   being.   <br>   Then regarding Articles 9 and 10 the High   Court Division held as follows:—   <br>   We have a shrewd suspicion that the substi-   tuted Article 9 and Article 10 were incorporated   in the Constitution only as an excuse for delet-   ing the original provisions because both the   substituted provisions are well provided for.   Article 11 read with Articles 59 and 60 covers   the substituted Article 9 while Article 28 takes   care of the substituted Article 10.   <br>   In this connection, it should be remem-   bered that a provision in the Constitution gives   _ only the basic law with wide ideas and the   Parliament enacts laws to give effect to those   ideas. If we examine the substituted Article 9   and Article 10 it would appear that Article 11   tead with Articles 59 and 60 and Article 28   Serves the purposes of those two substituted   Provisions very well and as a matter of fact   those two Articles are redundant and apparently   Were substituted only to camouflage the original   Article9 and the original Article 10 which were   TWO basic features of our Constitution.      ",
      "144. The High Court Division then quoting the   provisions of original Articles 6 and 9 of the   Constitution and amended version of the same as   shown in the above chart found that this concept of   Bangalee nationalism as provided in original Article   6 was further expounded and explained in the origi-      nal Article 9 of our Constitution.      The High Court Division held :—<br>   ...This provision glorified our concept of   Bangalee nationalism. The framers of the   Constitution in their wisdom, thought it neces-   sary to specifically spell out the basis of   Bangalee nationalism in the Constitution itself.   There may be many reasons for it. One reason   may be that from time immemorial, this part of   the world which is known as. Bengal during   British regime was continuously. invaded by   Shok, Hun, Pathans, Moguls and lastly by the   English. As such, the Bengalees although   retained their entity through their literature and   cultural heritage but always governed by the   people other than Bengalees. That is one of the   reasons, Bengal voted so much in favour   Muslim League in 1946 election on the Pakistan   issue but even after independence from British   yoke, in no time, their enthusiasm got a jolt   when Mr Jinnah declared at Dhaka in 1948 that   “Urdu would be the only state-language of   Pakistan. This was followed by a long history of                   conspiracies to cripple the majority East   Pakistan economically, politically and also to   destroy their cultural heritage and above all   their pride the Bangalee Nationalism but   instead, with the rise of oppression, Bengali   nationalism got new exuberance. The Pakistani   Military Janta instead of settling the issues   politically unleashed the worst genocide in the   history of mankind. One of their prime objec-   tives was to destroy and sweep away our   Bangalee nationalism from root, once for all   and make the Bengalees a hundred percent   Pakistani. In order to achieve such an ill-   advised end they did not only hesitate to kill   millions of innocent Bengalees and plunder   their belongings but also did their best to change   their identity as Bangalee.   <br>   In this historical context, the framers of the   Constitution in their anxiety, specifically spelt   out the basis of Bangalee nationalism in the   Constitution so that there should not be any con-   fusion about their entity as Bangalee. Because,   they had apprehensions like Justice Davies that   this country may not always ‘have wise and   humane rulers......... wicked men, ambitious of   power, with, hatred of liberty and contempt of   law, may fill the place.............   <br>   Our history shows that their anxiety was   not for nothing but was painfully correct   because inspite of Article 7 of the Constitution ,   as stated earlier, the usurpers by declaring   Martial Law seized the State Power. General   Ziaur Rahman by Proclamations Order No. | of   1977 and the Second Proclamation Order No.   IV of 1978, deleted Article 9 altogether, con-   taining the basis of Bengali nationalism. This   portion of the Proclamation Order did exactly   what the Pakistani Military Janta wanted to do   in Bangladesh in 1971 . The similarity of inten-      tions is so stark that it makes one start with sur-   prise.   <br>   We fail to understand why Article 9 had to   be repealed completely and possibly in order to      camouflage the repealed Article, it was substi-   tuted with a new one, which has no nexus with   Bangalee nationalism.    <br>   .......................................   <br>      The substituted Article 9 is in respect of   promotion of local Government Institutions but   Articles 11, 59 and 60 adequately provided tor   such institutions, as such, this substitution Was   unnecessary. The new provision, however   important it may appear but cannot delete the   basis of our Bangalee nationalism, contained in   original Article 9, for which the people of   Bangladesh fought for liberation and martyrs   made their supreme sacrifices. The original   Article 9 glorified our Bangalee Nation-hood,   possibly for the first time in our history, jn   recognition of such  nation-hood, — the   Constitution embalmed it as one its basic strue-   tures but its deletion by a Proclamation Order   constituted a betrayal to the freedom fighters   and the three million martyrs and an insult to   our Nation-hood”. :      ",
      "143. The High Court Division then quoting   original Article 6 of the Constitution and its amend-   ed version as shown in the above chart held as fol-   lows:—   <br>   ..........................................................   <br>      The inhabitants of this part of the world   irrespective of their cast, creed and religion   were known as Bengalees from time immemo-   rial. In their lighter moments they laugh as a   Bangalee, in their despair they cry as a   Bangalee, they record their feelings in Bangla,   their history, their philosophy, their culture,   their literature are all in Bangla. These finer fea-   tures of life and intellects gave them an identity   as a race in India for more than thousand years.   This was so recorded in the memoirs of Hiuen   Tsang, Ibn Batuta and many other travellers.   Even during the reign of Emperor Akbar, this   part of his empire was known as ‘Sube Bangla’.   As such, this identity as a Bangalee was not a   mere illusion or frivolous idiosyncrasy but has a   definite character, which separated them from   other races in Pakistan. The identity of Punjabis,   Pathans ete might have faded away in their new   identity as Pakistanis but the Bengalees con-   sciously kept their separate entity in their cul-   ture and literature inspite of their Pakistani citi-   zenship. This was their pride. Their such entity   as Bangalee blooms in their weal and woe. This   sentiment may not have strict legal value but   this very sentiment of Bangalee nationalism   paved the way to the ultimate independent   Bangladesh, which has a very definite legal   existence. As such, nobody, how high so ever,   must not ignore or undervalue the words   ‘Bangla’ or ‘Bangalee’ because since 1952,   beginning with the martyrs of language move-   ment, thousands of Bengalees gave their lives for   their right not only to speak Bangla but also to   live as such Bangalee. It is their basic nght and   very naturally, their Constitution recognised it.   <br>   Since this unwanted change of identity   from ‘Bangalee’ to ‘Bangiadeshi’ does not com-   mensurate with our national entity, this amend-   ment goes to the root of our Bangalee national-   ism”.      ",
      "141. The High Court Division also referred the   case of SR Bommai vs Union of India AIR 1994 SC   1918 wherein the addition of “Socialist” and   “Secularism” the Constitution of India in the year   1976 was considered. Ahmedi, J. (as his Lordship then   was) in considering secularism as one of the basic   structures of the Constitution observed at para 28:   <br><br>   “Notwithstanding the fact that the words   ‘Socialist’, and ‘Secular’ were added in the   Preamble of the Constitution in 1976 by the   42nd Amendment, the concept of Secularism   was very much embedded in our Constitutional   philosophy ...... By this amendment what was   implicit was made explicit. The Preamble itself   spoke of liberty of thought, expression, belief,   faith and worship. While granting this liberty   the Preamble promised equality of status and   opportunity. It also spoke of promoting fraterni-   ty, thereby assuring the dignity of the individual   and the unity and integrity of the Nation. While   granting to its citizen’s liberty of belief, faith   and worship, the Constitution abhorred discrim-   ination on grounds of religion etc., but permit-   ted special treatment for Scheduled Castes and   Tribes, vide Articles 15 and 16 . Art. 25 next   provided, subject to public order, morality and   health, that all persons shall be entitled to free-   dom of conscience and the right to profess,   practice and propagate religion. Art. 26 grants to   every religious denomination or any section   thereof, the right to establish and maintain insti-   tutions for religious purposes and to manage its   own affairs in matters of religion. These two   articles clearly confer a right to freedom of reli-   BION... ovviveceseecnacs State’s revenue cannot be   utilised for the promotion and maintenance of   any religion or religious group that secularism   is a basic feature of our Constitution.......... “   (Page-1951-52)      142, In considering the concept of secularism,   Sawant, J, held at para -88:      Chowdhury’ case evaluates Constitution |!   manner at para-272, page-118:-—   <br>   “These contention inevitably INViLe ys tod   cuss the concept of secularism as accepted |   our Constitution, Our Constitution does not ha   hibit the practice of any religion either ciate   or publicly   <br>   ....... Under Articles 14, 15 and 4   Constitution prohibits discrimination ABAINSL any   citizen on the ground of his religion and guaran.   tees equal protection of law and equal Opportu-   nity of public employment.(Page 2000)...    These provisions by implication prohibit   the establishment of a theocratic State and pre-   vent the State either identifying itself with of   favouring any particular religion or religious   sect or denomination, The State is enjoined to   accord equal treatment to all religions and relj-   gious sects and denominations. (Page-2000).   .......   <br>      K. Ramaswamy, J, quoting Dr S Radhakri-   shnan and Mahtma Gandhi, explained the con-   cept of secularism as a basic feature of Constitu-   tion of India, at para —124:   <br>   ” 124 The Constitution has   chosen secularism as its vehicle to establish   an egalitarian social order. | am respectfully   in agreement with our brethren Sawant and   Jeevan Reddy, JJ. In this respect. Secularism,   therefore, is part of the fundamental law and   basic structure of the Indian political system   to secure all its people socio-economic needs   essential for man’s excellence and of mor   well being, fulfillment of material prosper\")   and political justice.” (Page-2019 -20)      <br>   Shahabuddin Ahmed, J in Anwar Hossain   Chowdhuary's case ealutes Constitution in this   manner at para-272, page-118:-   <br>   “On the one hand, it gives out-lines of the   state apparatus, and aspirations of the people ; it   gives guarantees of fundamental rights of a cit-   izen and wlso makes him aware of his solemn   duty to himself} to his tellow citizen and to his   country,”                    No wonder his Lordship did not see any role of   religion in the Constitution itself. As such, from the   discussions made above, it is very clear that the   proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977 and the Second   proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, by making   omitting secularism, one of the State policy from the   Constitution, destroyed one of the basis of our strug-   ole for freedom and also changed the basic charac-   tet of the Republic as enshrined in the Preamble as   well as in Article 8(1) of the Constitution.      ",
      "140. According to O Hood Phillips, the pur-   pose of the Constitution is :—   <br>   “The Constitution of a state in the abstract   sense is the system of laws, customs and con-   ventions which define the composition and   powers of organs of the state, and regulate the   relations of the various state organs to one   another and to the private citizen. A   “Constitution” in the concrete sense is the doc-   ument in which the most important laws of the   Constitution are authoritatively ordained.”   (Quoted from O Hood Phillips’ Constitutional   and Administrative Law, Seventh Edition, 1987,   at page-S).   <br>   From the discussions made above on the   concept of written Constitution it would appear   that this instrument is predominantly for the   purpose of regulating the rights and obligations   of the people vis-a-vis the State and vice versa   but it has got nothing to do with the religious   beliefs of its people.   <br>   Bangladesh came into being with the basic   concepts of nationalism, socialism, democracy   and secularism. As such, its Constitution was   framed with those ideals in view. It was never   intended to be a theocratic State. Rather, it was   one of the major reasons for the Bengalees for   their costly struggle for liberation.   <br>   In this connection it should be noted that   the obligation of the State, in this respect, is to   ensure that all persons in the Country can per-   form their respective religious functions.   Besides, the State is to ensure that no discrimi-                   nation is made between the followers of one   religion over the other.”      ",
      "139. According to Thomas Paine, the purpose   Of the Constitution is -—-   <br>   “A Constitution is not the act of a govern-   ment, but of a people constituting a govern-   ment, and a government without a Constitution   is power without right ............... A consti-   tution is a thing antecedent to a government;   and a government is only the creature of a con-   stitution.” (1792) (Quoted from Hilaire Barnett   on Constitutional And administrative Law,   Fourth Edition, 2002, Page-7).      ",
      "138. The High Court Division then quoting the   provisions of original Article 8(1) and its amended   version and sub Article (1A) of the same as shown   in the above chart, held as follows:—      <br>   .................................................................   <br>      It is true that partition was made, more or   less on the basis of religion but India declared      itself as a secular Nation. Mr. Mohammad Ali   Jinnah, the first Governor General of Pakistan   although in his first September   11, 1947, hinted that in Pakistan people of all   religion would be equal without any religious   discrimination but its first Constitution, made in   1956, declared the country as the Islamic   Republic of Pakistan. The Constitution of 1962   made no difference. Pakistan, since the death of    its first Governor General, reduced itself into a   theocratic nation as happened in medival   Europe.       But the high ideals of equality and fraterni-   ty so very gloriously enshrined in Islam could   not spare the majority Population of the erst-   while East Pakistan from total discrimination in   all spheres of the State without any exception,   The erstwhile East Pakistan was treated as a   colony of West Pakistan and when VOICE Was   raised praying for at least near equal treatment,   steamroller of oppression was perpetrated on the   people of the Eastern wing. After a long 23 years,   the first general election in Pakistan was held in   1970 with one of the objects, to frame a   Constitution. The National Assembly was sched-   uled to be convened at Dhaka on March 3, 1971,   but General Yahya Khan, the President and   CMLA postponed the Assembly, forcing the   country into turmoil. Thereafter, on the night fol-   lowing March 25, 1971, General Yahya Khan   and his military government unleashed the worst   genocide in the history of mankind on the   unarmed people of the erstwhile East Pakistan,   and the ‘valiant’ armed forces of Pakistan brutal-   ly killed millions. The vast majority of the people   of this part of the world are God-fearing Muslims   but their religion could not even save the fellow   Muslims from being persecuted, killed and raped   and their belongings being plundered and all   ironically in the name of Islam.   <br>      Of necessity and  being forced, the unarmed       simple-minded Bengalees of then East    Pakistan took up arms and rose against the   tyranny for their survival. After liberation, such   oppression and persecution on the Bangalee   population was very much fresh in their minds.   They were determined to establish an independent    sovereign nation based on the democratic   principles of equality and social justice where   nobody will be discriminated on the ground of   religion.                 As such, the framers of the Constitution,   from their earlier bitter experience during, the   jjberation war, gave effect to the above lofty   ideals of our martyrs, which were reflected in   the Preamble and Article 8(1), and other provi-   gions of our Constitution. Those are the basic   gtructures of the Constitution, which were   changed on replacement of the provisions of the   original Preamble and Article 8(1) by the   proclamation Order No. | of 1977 and Second   Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978, but such   replacements changed the secular character of the   Republic of Bangladesh into a theocratic State.   <br>   In this connection it should be remembered   that the purpose of a Constitution is not to   describe the tenets of a particular religion but is   an Instrument creating the high institutions of   the Republic and its relationship with its people.   A Constitution upholds and guarantees such   dignity to the people of the Republic with its   own rights and also its obligations to the   Republic in a broader sense but the religion of a   particular section or sections of people shall nei-   ther required to be highlighted nor be interfered   with in an ideal and model democratic form of   Republic. The Constitution of such a Republic   would never contain or refer to a particular faith   but would leave such faculties with the people   themselves, Bangladesh was dreamt of as a sec-   ular country and came into being as a secular   country, as such, its Constitution was framed on   that ideal, but any change from such a basis   would constitute a change of the basic structure   of the Constitution.   <br>   Such belief would reside with the people in   accordance with their free will and shall never   be interfered with, either by the State or any   Section of the population, however majority   they may be. Such a secular concept would be   inhibited in a modern democratic Constitution   unless, of course, it is a theocratic State.      ",
      "137. Regarding the original second paragraph   of the Preamble and its amended version, which   have been shown in the above chart, the High Court   Division held that a plain reading comparing the   original Preamble with the amended one would   unmistakably show certain basic changes as the   original Preamble clearly show that one of the four   fundamental basis of our nation-hood and inspira-   tion of liberation was “secularism” but the amended   Preamble, specially the second paragraph, show that   ‘secularism’ was omitted from the Preamble thus   changing the basic character of the Constitution.      ",
      "136. Regarding the inclusion of the iii   “BISMILLAH” the High Court Division stated as   follows:   <br>   The words, commas and brackets 'BISMIL-   LAH-AR-RAHMAN-AR-RAHIM (In the name °   Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful) were inserted   before the word ‘PREAMBLE’ by the above Order.      The High Court Division then, regarding the   first paragraph of the preamble held that in the first   paragraph of the preamble in the original   Constitution the words ‘a historic war for national   independence’ were substituted for the original   words ‘a historic struggle for national liberation’      <br>   .................................................   <br>      ",
      "132. As it appears the High Court Division   prepared a chart showing the paragraphs of original   Preamble and Articles 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 25, 38 and 14?   of the Constitution and also the amended versions of   those after enactments of the Fifth Amendment. The   above chart along with other particulars as given by   the High Court Division are reproduced below:   <br>   “Before we discuss the above, as already   stated the Proclamations (Amendment) Order   1977 (Proclamations Order No.1 of 1977)   (Annexure-L-1 to the writ petition), replace?   many of the paragraphs in the Preamble and 1   various provisions of the Constitution. The   Proclamation was published in Banglades”   Gazette Extraordinary on April 23, 1977, TH   Proclamation made the following changes \" th   Constitution, amongst others”:                         Original Constitution   <br>         1 .

      "131. It was submitted by the petitioners that   identification of the principles of nationalism,   socialism and secularism by the High Court   Division as the basic structures of the Constitution   has no legal foundation and the same are contrary to   the decision given by the Appellate Division in   <i> Anwar Hossain</i> case.      ",
      "130. Then the High Court Division after quot-   ing paragraph Nos.1 -17 of the Fourth Schedule fur-   ther held as follows:   <br>   ...........................................................................................   ............................................................................................   <br>      “These are provided in pursuance to Article   150 . These provisions were necessary to protect   various laws, actions and decisions, made, taken   Or pronounced since the declaration of   Independence on March 26, 1971.                     Jurisprudentially, the necessity for provi-   sions for transitional and temporary provisions   cannot be ignored. The provisions are generally   made for the purpose of transition from the old   Jegal order to a new one to ensure continuity of   the legality of the new State. As such, of neces-   sity, these provisions were made so that no legal   yacuum occurs during the period from the time   when a new nation came into existence till a   Constitution of the said nation is framed.   Obviously these provisions by its very nature,   character and purpose, are of transitional and also   of temporary status and ambit. The facts, circum-   stances and incidents leading to the making of   those interim measures were necessary for the   smooth transition and continuance of the func-   tions of the young Republic of Bangladesh as a   legal entity of a Republic. Those interim measures   were a legal necessity and could not be avoided.   <br>   As such, the purpose of Article 150 is lim-   ited upto the commencement of the Constitution   and of any period mentioned in the Fourth   Schedule. The ambit of this Article cannot be   extended beyond the commencement of the   Constitution or any period mentioned in the   Fourth Schedule. In this regard we must keep in   view the words ‘transitional’ and ‘temporary’   appearing in Article 150 . .......... Similarly, the   meaning of the word ‘transition’ according to   The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, Edited   by Sara Tulloch, 1997, is ‘a passing or change   from one place, state, condition, etc., to another   (an age of transition), According to The   Chambers Dictionary, Deluxe Edition, Indian   Edition, 1993, the meaning of the word ‘transi-   tion’ is passage from one place, state, stage, and   style or subject to another.   <br>   ........................................................   <br>   ..............................................................   <br>   From these words it is so very clear that the   purpose of Article 150 of the Constitutions only   to protect various provisions, functions of dif-   ferent functionaries and all other actions taken   since the declaration of independence and till   the commencement of the Constitution. As   such, the purpose of Article 150 is limited   apparently only for that period and for a specif-   ic purpose.      <br>   ........................................................   <br>   ...................................................   <br>      It is very true that the Parliament by fol-   lowing the procedure mentioned in Article 142,   may add any provision in the Constitution so   long its basic structure is not disturbed but   Article 150 is a special provision. It deals with   only the transitional and temporary provisions   prior to the commencement of the Constitution.   This provision cannot be used to enlarge the   Fourth Schedule, by addition of the provisions,   which related to the period after the commence-   ment of the Constitution. If necessary, the   Parliament may add any provision to the   Constitution by way of amendment, without,   however, changing its basic character but can-   not enlarge the Fourth Schedule by adding any   provision which is not a provision made during   ‘apife sreila’ (‘transitional’) which ended with   the enactment and commencement of the   Constitution on December 16, 1972.      During the period between August 15, 1975   to April 9, 1979, the Constitution was made sub-   ordinate and subservient to the Martial Law   Proclamations etc. The provisions of the   Constitution were changed at the whims and   caprices of the usurpers and dictators. We have   already found that during the said period   democracy was replaced by dictatorship and   since November 1975, on the dissolution of the   National Assembly, Bangladesh lost its republi-   can character. Besides, Bangladesh cannot even                                              be considered independent during the said peri-   ed, Earlier, it, was conquered | by the British   Rulers, thereafter it Was under the domination   of the West Pakistanis. But this time ,for all   practical purposes, Bengaladesh was conquered   not by any foreign invaders but by Bengali   speaking Martial Law Authorities.               Article 150 is certainly not meant to be   abused by the usurpers for post facto legaliza-   tion of their illegal and illegitimate activities,   which were beyond the ambit of the Constitu-   tion. As a matter of fact, realizing that all the   Martial Law Proclamations etc. were un-consll-   tutional, they sought to make those legal by   incorporating those provisions as_ part of the   Constitution, But the Fourth Schedule is not   meant for dumping ground for illegal provi-   sions. Rather, what is wrong and illegal remains   so for all time to come. Besides, no one can take   advantage of his own wrongs.      The Constitution is a sacred document,   because it is the embodiment of the will of the   people of Bangladesh. It is not to be treated as a   logbook of Martial rules.      It appears that Paragraph 3A and 18 to the   Fourth Schedule, sought to ratify, confirm, vali-   date and legalise all illegal and illegitimate pro-   visions of Martial Law Proclamations, Martial   Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders. Those   Provisions and the actions taken thereon in viola-   tion of the Constitution, were not only illegal but   seditious acts on the part of the Martial Law   Authorities, as such, by any stretch of imagina-   tion, those provisions and the actions taken   thereon come within the ambit of the word ‘transitional’, As such, those unconstitu-   tional provisions were wrongly and illegally   thrust in to the Fourth Schedule presumably in   the garb of transitional and temporary provisions   and thereby a fraud has been committed on the   Constitution by such amendinents,” °      We are of the view that the High Court Division   unnecessarily dealt with    Article 150 of the      Constitution. As it appears paragraphs  21 and 22 as   included in the Fourth Schedule are the results : a   Eleventh and Twelfth Amendment Which were   enacted in order to strike down remaining portion   the provisions of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment   As will be discussed later on in details, the Fifth   Amendment which ratified and validated Paragraphs   3A and 18, is ultra vires because it ratified and val-   idated the Martial Law Proclamations, Regulation,   and Orders made by the authorities not recognized   by the Constitution and Article 142 thereof. Since   paragraphs 21 to 22 of the Fourth Schedule Were   accommodated in order to protect the Eleventh and   Twelfth Amendments by way of insertion of para 21   and 22 in the Fourth Schedule, therefore, all obser-   vations made by the High Court Division regarding   Article 150 and Fourth Schedule and also the find   ings thereof, are hereby expunged.            ",
      "129. The learned counsel of the petitioners   submitted that Article 150 of the Constitution pro-   vides a bar upon the High Court Division to enter-   tain writ in respect of transitional or temporary pro-   Vision.      Article 150 reads as follows :   English Text is:—   <br>   . “150 . The transitional and temporary provi-   sions set out in the Fourth Schedule shall have   effect notwithstanding   any other Provisions of   this Constitution.”   <br>   In this regard the High Court Division      held   as follows:— “   <br>   Article 150 of the Constitution Provide   that transitional and temporary Provisions      would be set out in the Fourth schedule. This   provision finds its place almost at the end of the   Constitution. It is preceded by Article 149, the   saving clauses for the existing laws and fol.   lowed by three other Articles, namely, Article   151, which deals with the repeal of certain   President’s Orders, Article 152 narrates the   interpretations of various words and Article 153   provides the date of commencement of the   Constitution, its citation and authenticity.      In pursuance to the above Article in the   Constitution, various transitional and temporary   provisions were set out in details in the Fourth   Schedule to the Constitution.   <br>   The heading of the Fourth Schedule reads - Its English   version is “Transitional and temporary provi-   sions’,   <br>   Both Article 150 and heading of the Fourth   Schedule show that the said Article, as well as   the Fourth Schedule, as set out in pursuance to   Article 150, deals with transitional interim   measures. A brief examination of the provisions   originally contained in the Fourth Schedule   with its English text, would make it clear.      ",
      "128. An effort has also been made by the peti-   tioners to apply the principle of estoppel and acqui-   escence to prevent the Fifth Amendment from being   declared w/tra vires but it is a well-established prin-   ciple that estoppel cannot be pleaded against or in   respect of a statute, much less to speak of the   Constitution. Similarly, there cannot be any acquies-      cence to hold valid an otherwise invalid law.      ",
      "127. Regarding the question of res judicata it   appears that the order dated 7-6-1994 passed by the   High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 802 of   1994 and the Judgment dated 5-7-1999 passed by   the Appellate Division in Civil Appeal No. 15 of   1997 also show that the Constitution (Fifth      Amendment) Act, 1979, was not judicially consid-   ered earlier. As such, there is no reason as to why we   would not consider not only the legality of the   Martial Law Proclamations etc. but also its legaliza-   tion, ratification, confirmation and validation by   inserting paragraph 18 in the Fourth Schedule to the   Constitution by virtue of section 2 of the   Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, special-   ly when the Rule was issued in that manner and   form.      ",
      "126. MH Rahman, J, in Anwar Hossain ’s case      at para 442 referring to the self-same submission of   the learned Attorney-General answered as fol-   lows:—   <br>   “442 . After referring to the various past   amendment particularly the Fourth Amend-   ment, the learned Attorney-General has submit-   ted that the Constitution has undergone so many   radical changes with regard to the Preamble,   powers of the President and several other   important matters that the doctrine of basic   structure merely evokes an amazement why if it   is such an important principles of law (and it   had already been propounded by the Indian   Supreme Court in 1973) it was not invoked ear-   lier in this Court. I find no force in this con-   tention. Because the principle was not invoked                      in the past the Court cannot be precluded now   trom considering it.”   <br>   Under the circumstances, the contentions of the   learned Advocates for the respondents that the Fifth   Amendment had already been accepted by the peo-   ple of Bangladesh by acquiescence, have got no sub-   stance.      ",
      "125. Regarding the submission of the petition-:   ers that the Appellate Division in Anwar Hossain’s   case already refused to consider the past amend-   ments of the Constitution, which affected the basis   structure of the Constitution, the High Court held as   follows:—    <br>  Referring to an observation of Shahab-   uddin Ahmed, J (as his Lordship then was), Mr   Akhtar Imam, Advocate, on behalf Of the   respondent No. 3, submitted that the Appellate   Division in Anwar. Hossain Chowdhury's case   already refused to consider the past amend-   ments of the Constitution which had admittedly   destroyed the basic structure of the Constitu-   tion, as such, the learned Advocate submitted   that it is now too late in the day after a delay, of   about 26 years since the Constitution (Fifth   Amendment) Act was passed, to challenge its,   vires in view of the above decision of the,   Appellate Division.         The learned Advocate in effect wanted to   impress upon us that the vires of the   Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, hag   already been duly considered by the Appellate   Division in the case of Anwar Hossain Chow-   dhury etc. vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD (Spl) l and   since the Court found on the basis of the deci-   sion in Golak Nath’s case that the said constitu-   tional amendment was accepted by the people   of Bangladesh and became part of the   Constitution by general acquiescence, the legal-   ity of the said Constitution (Fifth Amendment)   Act, cannot now be re-opened all over again.      These contentions raised on behalf of the   respondents, on the face of it have no legs to   stand on. These contentions are fallacious, mis-   conceived and have no substance. However, we   shall deal with these contentions in some details   to repel any confusion in these regards.      The main plank of the above noted argu-   ments are based on an observation of Shaha-   buddin Ahmed, J, in the case of Anwar Hossain   Chowdhury etc. vs Bangladesh 1989 BLD (Spl)   1 . The said observations were made at para-33   of his Lordship’s Judgment:—   <br>   “In spite of these vital changes from 19?   by destroying some of the basic structures of the   Constitution, nobody challenged them 10 Court   after revival of the Constitution; consequent.   they were accepted by the people, and by then   acquiescence have become part of the Constitu-      tion.       In the case of Golak Nath, the Indian   Supreme Court found three past amendments of   their Constitution invalid on the ground of alter-   ation of the basic structures, but refrained from   declaring them void in order prevent chaos in   the national life and applied the Doctrine of   prospective Invalidation for the future. In our   case also the past amendments, which were not   challenged, have become _ part of the   Constitution by general acquiescence. But the   fact that basic structures of the Constitution   were changed in the past cannot be, and is not,   accepted as a valid ground to answer the chal-   Jenge to future amendment of this nature, that is,   the Impugned Amendment may be challenged   on the ground that it has altered the basic struc-   ture of the Constitution.”      On the basis of this observation, the learned   Advocates for the respondents stoutly submitted   that the Fifth Amendment has been accepted by   the people of Bangladesh by acquiescence and   is now part of the Constitution, so also Martial   Law culture and jurisprudence and cannot now   its validity be challenged all over again. The   learned Advocates argued these contentions on   the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court   of India in the case of Golak Nath vs State of   Punjab AIR 1967 SC 1643 but without at all   appreciating the context and perspective of the   said decision, as such, it is necessary to recapit-   ulate the said decision and its background.      In Kesavananda Bharat’ case, AIR (SC)   Sikri, CJ explained the matter at para-487 as   follows:—   <br>   “In this connection I may deal with the   argument that the device of Art. 31B and the   Ninth Schedule has up till now been upheld by   this Court and it is now too late to impeach it.   But the point now raised before us has never   been raised and debated before. As Lord Atkin   Observed in Proprietary Articles Trade   Association vs Attorney-General for Canada,   1931 AC 310 at “Their Lordships entertain no   doubt that time alone will not validate an Act      Which when challenged is found to be xtra   vires ; nor will a history of a gradual series of   advances till this boundary is finally crossed   avail to protect the ultimate encroachment.      If any further authority is needed, | may   refer to Attorney-General for Australia vs   Queen and the Boilermakers’ Society of   Australia, 1957 AC 288 at p. 328 . The Judicial   Committee, while considering the question   whether certain sections of the Conciliation and   Arbitration Act, 1904-1952 were ultra vires   inasmuch as the Commonwealth Court of   Conciliation and Arbitration had been invested   with the executive powers along with the judi-   cial powers, referred to the point why for a   quarter of century no litigant had attacked the   validity of this obviously illegitimate union, and   observed :   <br>   “Whatever the reason may be, just as there   Was a patent invalidity in the original Act which   for a number of years went unchallenged, so for   a greater number of years an invalidity which to   their Lordships as to the majority of the High   Court has been convincingly demonstrated, has   been disregarded. Such clear conviction must   find expression in the appropriate judgment.”      ",
      "124. These well reasoned decisions only con-   firm our view that the plea of waiver or acquies-   cence is no ground in considering the of vires of a   constitutional amendment or for that matter any law.   Validity of an Act of Parliament effecting an amend-   ment of the Constitution is to be considered on its   own merit as to whether such an amendment vio-   lates the Constitution itself even on a remote manner   or not, but delay in challenging any such amend-   ment, on its own, is not a valid objection to such a   challenge.      ",
      "24. It is argued that since the impugned   provision has been in existence for over twenty   three years and its validity has once been upheld   by the High Court, this Court should not pro-                      nounce upon its validity at this late stage. There   are two answers to this proposition. First, the   very fact that nearly twenty three years are Over   from the date of the enactment of the impugned   provision and the discriminations is allowed to   be continued unjustifiably for such a long time   is a ground of attack in these case........The sec-   ond answer to the above contention is that mere   lapse of time does not lend constitutionality to a   provision which is otherwise bad. Time does not   run in favour of legislation. If it is ultra vires, it   cannot gain legal strength from long failure on   the part of lawyers to perceive and set up its   invalidity. Albeit, lateness in an attack upon the   constitutionality of a statute is not a reason for   exercising special caution in examining the   arguments by which the attack is supported”   (See W. A. Wvnes: ‘Legislative, Executive and   Judicial Powers in Australia’, Fifth Edition, p.   33). We are constrained to pronounce upon the   validity of the impugned provision at this late   stage.....because the garb. of constitutionality   which it may have possessed earlier become   worm out and its unconstitutionality is now   brought to a successful challenge.”      ",
      "123. In the case of Motor General Traders vs   State of Andhra Pradesh AIR 1984 SC 121, in con-   sidering the validity of section 32(b) of AP   Buildings Control Act of violative at Article 14 of   the Constitution of India, Venkataramiah, J., held at   para —24:   <br>   “",
      "122. In the case of Frederick Walz vs Tux   Commission of New York 25 L Ed 2d 697 (397 US   664) (1970), grant of property tax exemptions under   the New York Constitution, to religions organiza-   tions were challenged on the ground of violation of   First Amendment of US Federal Constitution. In   deciding the issue, Chief Justice Burger held at para   — 12, page — 706:      “[12] It is obviously correct that no one   acquires a vested or protected right in violation   of the Constitution by long use, even when that   span of time covers our entire national existence   and indeed predates it”.      ",
      "121. In the case of Grace Brothers Proprietary   Limited vs Commonwealth (1 946) 72 CLR 269 . the   validity of the land Acquisition Acts 1906-1936   were challenged. In deciding the issue in the High   Court of Australia, Dixon J. held at page- 289:      \" ........... the plaintiffs next proceed to   impugn the validity of the Lands Acquisition   Act 1906-1936 itself. Time does not run in   favour of the validity of legislation. If it is w/tra   vires, it cannot gain legal strength from long   failure on the part of lawyers to perceive and set   up its invalidity. At best, lateness in an attack   upon the constitutionality of a statute is but a   reason for exercising special caution in examin-   ing the arguments by which the attack is sup-   ported.”      ",
      "120. In the case of Proprietary Articles Trade   Association vs Attorney-General of Canada 1931   All ER 277 PC, the vires of Combines Investigation   ~ Act (1927) and Section 498 of the Criminal Code   (1927) were under challenge. In considering the      question, Lord Atkin for the Board held at page-   280A;    <br>  “Their Lordships entertain no doubt that   lime alone will not validate an Act which, when   challenged, is found to be wlfra vires; nor will a   history of a gradual series of advances till this   boundary is finally crossed avail to protect the   ultimate encroachment.”      ",
      "119. In the case of Lois P Myers vs United   States 272 US 52 (1926) the Tenure of Office Act of   1867 and an Act of Congress of 1876, were declared   invalid after more than 50 years after its enactment.      ",
      "118. As stated earlier the United States of   America during its long and eventful history, also   passed through many a turbulent periods but none of   its amendments was made for anything but further   advancement of civilization and humanity but not to   legalize illegal acts. Its purpose is not to engineer or   as a device to hide the illegal activities of usurpers   or dictators but for achieving further improvements,   further refinements of the constitutional position of   the citizens of a Republic. This is the true spirit for   amendment of a Constitution, the supreme law of   the Republic. If the Court finds that the amendment   is affected for a collateral and illegal purpose, the   Court will not be slow to declare it so in exercise of   its high constitutional duties ordained upon it. There   is no law of limitation in challenging an unconstitu-   tional action, conduct, behaviour or acts. In such a   situation, the cause of action is recurring till such   acts are judicially considered. Constitutional ques-   tions are of utmost national as well as of legal inter-   est and mere collateral observation does not carry   much of an importance than a bare passing remark   without any conviction.      ",
      "117. Further, if the Constitution is wronged. It   is a grave offence of unfathomed enormity commit   ted against each and every citizens of the Republic,                    it is a continuing and recurring wrong committed   against the Republic itself. It remains a wrong   against future generations of citizens. As such, there   vant be any plea of waiver or acquiescence in   respect of unconstitutionality of a provision or an   Act of Parliament.      ",
      "116. We have already held that making of the   Constitution subordinate and subservient to the   Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations and Orders   are absolutely illegal, void and non-est in the eye of   law. So any attempt to legalise this illegality in any   manner or method and by any Authority oF   Institution, how high so ever, is also void and non-   est and remains so forever.      ",
      "115. Further, the answer in this respect has   been aptly given by Denning LJ in Qacker vs   Packer (1953) 2 All ER 127 at page — 129 H.    <br>  “ What is the argument on the other side ?   Only this that no case has been found in which   it has been done before. That argument does not   appeal to me in the least. If we never do any-   thing which has not been done before, we shall   never get anywhere .The law will stand still   while the rest of the world goes on, and that will   be bad for both”.      Accordingly, we are also of the view that it is   far, far better thing that we do now, what should be   done in the interest of justice, even it was not done   earlier.      ",
      "114. The next submission of the petitioners   that the Fifth Amendment have been accepted by the   people and so it cannot be challenged in view of the   principle of waiver and acquiescence by delay.      In this regard the High Court Division held as   follows :    <br>  “Let us now consider the contention that   whether the vires of the Martial Law   Proclamation etc. and the Fifth Amendment, has   become barred by waiver and acquiescence, due   to long delay in challenging those provisions. It   was further contended that this delay shows that   the people of Bangladesh had already accepted   the Fifth Amendment, ratifying the Martial Law   Proclamations etc. This proposition is anything   but correct. Conclusions or inferences based on   the facts and circumstances may vary with the   change of social out-look or political situation   but what is legally wrong remains wrong forev-      er.      Similarly, if there is a violation of law, it   remains a violation for all time to come with   consequential and inevitable results. The law of   adverse possession has got no application in   case of unconstitutional acts and events. One   must not loose sight that the Constitution is   supreme and every person in the Republic, be   he is a servant of the Republic or an ordinary   citizen, owe his unquestionable, unqualified and   absolute loyalty to the Constitution. Any   attempt to deface the Constitution or to make it   subservient tantamount to the offence of sedi-   tion of worst kind. The Fifth Amendment   sought to legalize such offences committed by   the Martial Law Authorities and the learned the   Advocates for the respondents submitted that j,   cannot be questioned, because  thy,,   Proclamations etc. were made by the Martial   Law Authorities, that the Fifth Amendment   itself provided that the ratification, confirmation   and the validation of those Proclamations etc   and the actions taken thereon cannot be ques.   tioned before any Court, that it is beyond ques.   tion because nobody challenged those in all   these years, as such, deemed to be waived or   acquiesced, Those arguments are neither legal   nor logical. Those arguments would not have   been accepted even before the Star Chamber not   to speak in the dawn of 21st century.”      ",
      "113. However, the above view does not depict the correct law as can be seen from the number of decisions cited hereinabove and secondly this state- ment is simply an obiter diclum as it was Made while dealing with the eight Amendment and the      Fifth Amendment was not in issue in the above deci-   sion and the observation was also uncalled for and   thirdly, no other judges in the said case agreed with   the said observation and as such it cannot be treated   as ratio decidendi so as to have binding force under   article 111 . It may be noted here that four learned   judges heard the appeal and out of them only MH   Rahman, J. concurred with Shahabuddin J’s deci-   sion that Eight Amendment was unconstitutional   and not with the above quoted observation of   Shahabuddin J regarding Fifth Amendment.      ",
      "112. The petitioners, relying on the views of Shahabuddin Ahmed, J expressed in Anwar Hossain s case to the effect that in spite of these vital changes from 1975 by destroying some of the basis structures of the Constitution nobody challenged them in Court after revival of the Constitution and consequently they were accepted by the people and by their acquiescence have become part of the  Constitution, submitted that in view of the principle of acquiescence the writ petition is not maintainable.  ",
      "111. In dealing with ratio decidendi to operate as a precedent, Salmond in jurisprudence }2th Edition page 183 observed:—  “Where there are several different judg- ments, as in a case on appeal, the ratio must be ascertained from the judgments of those in favour of the final decision. A dissenting Judg- ment, valuable and important though it may be, cannot count as part of the ratio, for it played no part in the Court’s reaching their decision. It may happen in an appeal Court that all the judges concur in the decision but each one gives different reasons for it. In such a case one can only follow the advice of Lord Dunedin, who said that if it is not clear what the ratio deciden- di was, then it is no part ofa later tribunal’s duty to spell out with great difficulty a ratio deciden- di in order to be bound by it.”  ",
      "110. Henry J. Abraham’s in his “The Judicial Process” quoted Douglas J of the US Supreme Court saying that— <br> “a judge looking a constitutional decision may have compulsions to revere past history and accept what was once written; but he remembers above all also that it is. the “Constitution which he swore to support and defend, not the gloss which his predecessor may have put on it”.  ",
      "109. Further this doctrine of precedent, how-  ever Cannot control questions involving involving the con-  struction and interpretation of the Constitution or at least does not apply with the same force to the deci- sions on constitutional questions as to other deci- sions. Even though the previous decisions will not be entirely disregarded and may, in case of doubt, control the views of the Court.  ",
      "108. As regards the stare decisis, Halsburys Laws of England states as follows:—  “In general the House of Lords will not overrule a long established course of decisions except in plain cases where serious inconven- ience or injustice would follow from perpetuat- ing an erroneous construction or ruling of law. The same considerations do not apply where the decision, although followed, had been frequent- ly questioned and doubted. In such a case it may be overruled by any Court of superior jurisdic- tion. When old authorities are plainly wrong, and especially where the subsequent course of judicial decisions has disclosed weakness in the reasoning on which they were based and practi- cal injustice in the consequences that must flow from them, it is the duty of the House of Lords to overrule them”’.  ",
      "107. Further the role of stare decisis in consti- tutional interpretation is also very insignificant par- ticularly when the earlier decision is manifestly wrong. In this regard in Asma Jilanis case (supra) at page 139, 168-169, the Chief Justice quoted with  approval, the statement in Corpus Juris Secumdum, which is as follows:—  “The doctrine of stare decisis cannot be invoked to sustain, as authority, a decision  which is in conflict with the provisions of the state Constitution”.  ",
      "106. We are also of the view that simply because the laws made by the Martial Law Authorities and actions taken under it were consid- ered by this Division in the cases of Halima Khatun Joynal Abedin, Ehteshamuddin and Nasiruddin and in those cases Martial Law being not declared ultra vires the Constitution, those laws will not attain validity. Further, as pointed out earlier, in none of those case, the invalidity of the Fifth Amendment was challenged and so those cases cannot operate as precedent for the validity of the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly there is no substance to the submission of the petitioners that the decisions in the above cases touching the actions of the Martial Law authorities provide some binding precedents under Article 111 of the Constitution and so the actions of martial Law authorities cannot be challenged in the Court. In order to apply the provision of Article 111 an issue must be raised and deliberated upon and decided before it can operate as a binding precedent Further what is binding as a law is the ratio of a decision and not the finding of a fact or the conclu-   sion reached by the Court. as held in the case of Dalbir Singh vs India, 1979 AIR 1384 . Moreover, as  held in the case of Bangladesh vs Mizanur Rahman, 52 DLR (AD) 149 this Division having the power of review is not bound by a view earlier taken by this division.  ",
      "105. As it appears the High Coun Division also stated that similar question as to Validity of Martial Law was also faced by Hamoodur Rahman CJ in Asma Jilanis case wherein his Lordship con- sidering the case of Muhammad Ismail vs State PLD 1969 SC 24] in which the judgment was deliv- ered again by himself, and also the case of Mia Fazal Ahmed vs State PLD 1969 SC 24] held that in those cases no question was raised as to the Validly of the Martial Law Order or of the Provisional Constitution Order and therefore it is incorrect to say that the Supreme Court had given any legal recognition to the regime of General Yahya Khan.  ",
      "104. I is thus apparent that the vires of the  Fifth Amendment to the Constitution was not under challenge in any of the above cases. This is also admitted by the learned Additional Attorney- General and also the learned Advocate for. the  respondent No. 53 . Besides, at Paragraph-25 of the Judgment it 1s categorically stated that neither the authority of the person who proclaimed Martial Law nor the vires of the Martial Law Regulations was challenged in the said case. In Nasiruddin ' case , the Issue was Whether the writ abated. in View of sub- paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 read with paragraph 4 of Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 . This case has got no nexus with the Fifth Amendment  ",
      "103. In Ehteshamuddin's case the issues were: <br> “(i) Whether the proceedings of the Special Martial Law Court could be examined after the enactment of the Fifth Amendment and _ the Proclamation made on April, 7, 1979 by the CMLA, withdrawing the Martial Law and revoking the earlier Proclamations. <br> (ii) The extent of protection given under the Fifth Amendment. | <br> (iii) Whether the decision of the Government can be called in question under Article 102 of the Constitution despite the Proclamation of April 6, 1979”.  ",
      "102. Regarding Nasiruddin's case 32 DLR (AD) 216, the High Court Division found as fol- lows:— This case was decided on 14-4-1980 . It is also in respect or an abandoned property. It modified the effect of the decision of the earlier Halbna Khatun's case to some extent but the observations of Fazle Muni111, .J, in respect of the status of Martial Law vis-a-vis the Constitution made in the said decision, remained unaltered. Kelnaluddin Hossain, Cj, however, held at para-10, page 221 : \"It is to be observed that when an authority is vested with a jurisdiction to do certain acts and in the exercise of that jurisdiction he does it wrongly or irregularly the action can be said to be done within the purported exercise of his jurisdiction. But an act which is manifestly without jurisdiction, such as the property which not being an abandoned property within the meaning of Presidential Order 16 of 1972 is declared to be so, or in case of judicial or quasi judicial act which is coram non judice, the use of the expression 'purported exercise' in the val- idating clause of Fifth Amendment 01' the Constitution cannot give such act the protection from challenge, it being ultra vires. It is true malafide act is also not protected, but then malafide is to be pleaded with particulars con- Stituting such malafide and established by copent materials before the Court.” <br> ................................................................................ .............................................................................. <br>  In this connection it should also be noted that the case of Kh. Ehteshamuddin Ahmed vs Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) 154 was decided on 27-3-1980 and the case of Nasiruddin vs Government of Bangladesh 32 DLR (AD) 216  was decided on 14-4-1980 . Both the cases were decided after the Fifth Amendment was passed on April 6, 1979, by the Second Parliament.  A question although was not raised but yet may arise that since those two cases were decid- ed after the enactment of the Fifth Amendment whether it can be said that the Appellate Division approved the Fifth Amendment, at least impliedly? However, it is not, since the vires of the Fifth Amendment was not under challenge in any of those two appeals, even indirectly. The issues involved in those two cases were nowhere near the Fifth Amendment.  ",
      "101. The conunent of the High Court Division on the above judgment is that the Appellate Division found: <br> \"(i) The Constitution continued subject to the Proclamations.<br> (ii) The Suprelnacy of the Constitution can- not by any means compete with the <br> Proclamation. (iii) The Chief Martial Law Administrator would not be deemed to be a person holding an office of profit in the service of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. <br> (iv) The High Court lost its superior power to issue writ against the Martial Law Authority or Martial Law Courts\". <br> ' 'From the above Judgment it is apparent that even after lifting of the Martial Law, its pro- visions remained supreme and on the face of the MLRs, the Constitution was relegated even fur- ther to the back-seat. Although at that time the Martial Law was not there but even then the Constitution was read subject to the Martial Law and was made to recoil on the face of the bare shadow of the MLRs\". ''It is apparent from the above Judgement that the effect of the Proclamation was that the Constitution is supreme only when the Martial Law is not near by and even long after the lift- ing the Martial law, on the Cace of its bare shadow, the Constitution with its S supremacy• a worthless sheaf of papers, Whether we like it or not the status of the Constitution Was reduced to such an ignoble shambles by the Proclamations, the MLRs and the MLOs, which would have blushed even Henry VIII or Louis X I V. During the reign or Henry VIII in the 16th Century, the Proclamations were issued by the King but in pursuance of an Act of Parliament and no prerogative right to issue proclamation was allowed even to the King of England by the Chief Justice Coke four hundred years ago in 1610. ",
      "100. His Lordship then at para-25, page-1 66 furthcr held: \"25 . Before I proceed further it may be mentioned that in the present case neither the authority of the person who proclamation Martial Law nor the vires of the Martial Law Regulation was or could bc challenged at the bar excepting arguing on the question or supretnacy of the Constitution over the Proclamations and Martial Law Regulations. Since the authority of the Chief Martial Law Administrator is not chal- lenged and the vires of the relevant Martial Law Regulation is also not challenged, I do not find any good reason making reference to Asma jilani's• case\". ",
      "99. His Lordship then at Para -18 page-163  held: <br> “18 . In that case, on the question of High Court’s power under the Constitution to issue ° writ against the Martial Law Authority or Martial Law Courts, this Division has given the answer that the High Courts being creature under the Constitution with the Proclamation 0! Martial Law and the Constitution allowed to remain operative subject to the Proclamation and Martial Law Regulation, it loses its superi or power to issue writ against the Martial Law  Authority or Martial Law Courts.......  ****** Result for Image/Page 1 ****** ",
      "98. Regarding the next case i.e. the case of Kh. Ehteshamuddin Ahmed vs Bangladesh, 33 DLR (AD) /54 the High Court Division held as fol- lows:—  In this case a writ petition was filed chal- lenging the proceedings in passing the Judgment and Order of conviction passed by the Special Martial Law Court. The Proclamation etc. were not challenged. The High Court Division sum- marily rejected the writ petition by an order dated June, 13, 1979, on the ground of ouster of Jurisdiction by MLR 1 of 1975.  By this time, Proclamations Were revoked and the Martial Law was Withdrawn.  Leave was granted, jnre;- alia, to Consider as  to whether the proceeding of the Special Martial Law Court could be examined by the High court Division after passing of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.   In this case, the vires of the Fifth Amendment was not challenged. This position was Admitted by the learned Advocates of both the Sides, the Court considered the legality of the Proceedings before the Special Martial Law Court When thy country was under Martial Law. The Judgment of the Appellate Division was given on March 27, 1980.  At that time although Martial Law was with. drawn still its dark shadows apparently loomed large over the country and its Constitution, as found by the Court. His Lordship Ruhul Islam. J., in considering Article 7, held at para-16 page- 163:  “It is true that Article 7(2) declares the Constitution as the Supreme Law of’ the Republic and if any other law is inconsistent with the Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void, but the Supremacy of the Constitution cannot by any means Compete with the Proclamation issued by the Chief Martial Law”.  ",
      "97. Regarding Haji Joynal Abedin’ case 32 DLR  (AD) 1/0 the High Court Division stated as follows:  In this case a writ petition was filed chal- lenging the legality of the order of conviction passed by the Special Martial Law Court. The legality of Proclamations etc. was not the issue in that case. The High Court Division declared the said order of conviction and sentence was without lawful authority and of no legal effect.  Leave was granted, inter alia, to consider as to whether in view of the Proclamation dated August 20, 1975, the High Court Division acted within its jurisdiction in issuing the writ.  After tracing the history of the Proclama- tion of Martial Law, declared on August 20, 1975 at page-16 and 17 of the Report, Ruhul Islam, J, held at para-18, page- 122:  ‘From a consideration of the features noted above it leaves no room for doubt that the Constitution though not abrogated, was reduced to a position subordinate to the Proclamation, inasmuch as, the unamended and unsuspended constitutional provisions were kept in force and allowed to continue subject to the Proclamation and Martial Law Regulation or orders and other orders; and the Constitution was amended from time to time by issuing Proclamation. In the face of the facts stated above I find it difficult to accept the arguments advanced in support of the view that the Constitution as such 1s still in force as the supreme law of the country, untrammeled by the Proclamation and Martial Law Regulation. .............. ”  Ruhul Islam J, then at. para-19: page-|22-23  held: <br> ............. So long the Constitution is in force as the Supreme law of the country, any act done or Proceeding taken by a person purporting to function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of a local authority may be made the Subject matter of review by High Court in exer- cis¢ of its writ jurisdiction. The moment the country is put under Martial Law, the above noted constitutional provision along with other civil laws of the country loses its superior posi- tion”,  Ruhul Islam, J very specifically spelt out that the Constitution was reduced to a position sub- ordinate to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs.  This opinion of the Appellate Division was given on Decembers 20, 1978 . At that time the country was under Martial Law”’.  According to the High Court Division by the above judgment .... <br> (i) The Constitution was reduced to a posi- tion subordinate to the Proclamation. <br> (ii) The unamended unsuspended Constitu- tional provisions were allowed to continue sub- Ject to the Proclamations and MLRs and MLOs. <br> (iii) The Constitution was amended from time to time by issuing Proclamations. <br> (iv) The moment the country is put under Martial Law, the Constitution looses its superior position”. <br> ",
      "96. Fazle Munim, J, held that the Constitution of Bangladesh was made subservient and subordi- _. Hate to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs.  According to the High Court Division in view of the above Judgment— <br> (i) Under the Proclamations, the Constitution Jost its character as the supreme _law of the Republic. <br> (ii) The Constitution is subordinate to the Proclamations and the Repulations and Orders  made there under.  <br> iii. Constitution is superior to any law other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation”’.  ",
      "95. Now coming to the cases of Halima  Khatun, Joynal Abedin, Ehteshamuddin and Nasir- uddin where the status of the said Proclamations dated August 15, 1975, November and 29 of 197§ and Martial Law Regulations and Orders have been considered, the High Court Division regarding Halima Khatuns case stated as follows:— . <br> The first is the case of Halima Khatun \\s Bangladesh 30 DLR (SC) 207 . In the said case. the legality of the Proclamations etc. was not the issue but inclusion of a property in the list of abandoned properties was challenged in the High Court. The Rule was discharged on the ground that the question as to whether the rele- vant property was abandoned or not is a disput- ed question of fact. On appeal question arose before the Appellate Division, whether in view of the provisions of the Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulation 1977. (MLR No. VII of 1977) the aforesaid writ pett- tion abated. This appeal was decided on January 4,1978 . Bangladesh was at that time under Martial Law. After considering the Proclama- tions, MLRs and MLOs and also the Constitution including Article 7, Fazle Munim, J. (as his Lordship then was), observed at para-18 : <br> \" ...... what appears from the  Proclamation of August 20, 1975 is that with the declaration of Martial Law in Bangladesh 0” August 15, 1975, Mr Khondker Mushtaque Ahmed who became the President of Bangladesh assumed full powers of the Government and by Clause (d) and (c) of the Proclamation made the Constitution of Bangladesh, which was allowed to remain in force, subordinate to the Proclamation and any Regulation or order ai may be made by the President in pursuance thereof. In Clause (hy the power to amend the Proclamation vas provided. Jt may be true that whenever there would be any conflict between the Constitution and the Proclamation or a Regulation or an Order the intention, a5 appears from the language employed, does not seem to concede such supe- riority to the Constitution. Under the Proclama- tion, Which contains the aforesaid clauses, the Constitution has Jost its character as the Supreme law of the country. There is no doubt, an express declaration in Article 7(2)of the Constitution to the following effect : <br> “This Constitution is, as the solemn expres- sion of the will of the people, the Supreme law of the Republic and if any other law is inconsis- tent with this Constitution that other law shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void.” Ironically cnough, this Article, though. still exists, must be taken to have lost some of its Importance and efficacy. In view of clauses (d), (c) and (g) of the Proclamation the supremacy of the Constitution as declared in that Article is no longer unqualified. In spite of this Article, no Constitutional provision can claim to be sacro- sanct and immutable. The present Constituti- onal provision may however, claim superiority to any law other than a Regulation or Order made under the Proclamation.”  ",
      "94. The Supreme Court, on the basis of the the- ory propounded by Hans Kelsen, accorded legitima- cy to the assumption of power by General Ayub Khan holding that coup d’etat was a legitimate means to bring about change in the government and particularly so when the new order brought about by the change had been accepted by the people. It was held that where a Constitution and the national legal order under it was disrupted by an abrupt political change not within the contemplation of the Constitution, then such a change would be a revolu-  tion and its legal effect would not only be the destruction of the Constitution but also the validity  of the national legal order, irrespective of how or by whom such a change was brought about. In the result, in accordance with the judgment of the majority, the proceedings for writs in each of these cases were held to have abated. The result Was that the directions made and the writs issued by the High Court were set aside. However, in 1972 . in Asma Jilani’s case, the details of which will be discussed later on, the above view was overruled by Pakistan Supreme Court.   ",
      "93. Under Clause (7) of Article 2 of the Laws (Continuance in Force) Order 1958, all writ peti- tions pending in High Courts seeking enforcement of fundamental rights stood abated. The Court held that if the Constitution was destroyed by a success- ful revolution, the validity of the prevalent laws depended upon the will of the new law-creating organ. Therefore, if the new legal order preserved any one or more laws of the old legal order, then a writ would lie for violation of the same. As regards pending applications for writs or writs already issued but which were either sub judice before the Supreme Court or required enforcement, the Court in the light of the Laws (Continuance in Force) Order, 1958 held that excepting the writs issued by the Supreme Court after Proclamation and before the promulgation of the Order, no writ or order for a writ issued or made after Proclamation shall have any legal effect unless the writ was issued on the ground that anyone or more of the laws mentioned in Article 4 or any other right kept alive by the new Order had been contravened. |  ",
      "92. In Dossos case the respondents in one of the appeals were tried by a Jirga (council of elders) under the provisions of the Frontier Crimes Regulation, 1901 (FCR) and convicted and sen- tenced under different provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 . They filed applications before the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus and certiorari on the ground that the provisions of the FCR enabling the executive authorities to refer a criminal case to a Council of Elders were void under Article 4 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1956 . The High Court accepted the con- tention and held that the provisions of FCR could be enforced under subsection (4) of section 1 (ibid) only against Pathans and Baluchis and against such other persons the local government may notify and as this was not a reasonable classification, those pro- visions were u/tra vires Article 5 of the Constitution. The convictions and sentences were set aside, and the respondents were ordered to be treated as under trial prisoners, it being left to the government to refer their cases to a Court of law. On appeals filed by the State before the Federal Court against the impugned orders of the High Court, the validity of the exercise of power by the High Court was adjudged in the context of the actions of 7th October, 1958 . What happened was that by Proclamation of that data, the President of Pakistan annulled the Constitution of 1956, dismissed the Central Cabinet and the Provincial Cabinets and dis- solved the National Assembly and both Provincial Assemblies. Simultaneously, Martial Law was declared throughout the country and Commander-in Chief of the Pakistan Army was appointed as the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Three days later, the President promulgated the Laws (Continuance in Force) order, 1958, the general effect of which was the validation of laws other than the late Constitu- tion, that were in force before Proclamation, and restoration of the jurisdiction of all Courts including the Supreme Court and High Courts. The Order con- tained the further direction that the country, there- after to be known as Pakistan and not the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, should be governed as nearly as may be in accordance with the late Constitution.  ",
      "91. The answer returned by the Federal Court (by majority) was that in the situation presented by  the Reference, the Governor-General has, during the interim period, the power under the common law of civil or state necessity of retrospectively validating the laws listed in the Schedules to the Emergency Powers Ordinance, 1955, and all those laws, until the question of their validation was decided upon by the Constituent Assembly, where, during the afore- said period, valid and enforceable in the same way as if they had been valid from the date on which they purported to come into force.  ",
      "90. The Governor-General made a reference to the Federal Court under section 213 of the Government of India Act, 1935 asking for the Court’s opinion on the question whether there was any provision in the Constitution or any rule of law applicable to the situation by which the Governor- General could, by Order or otherwise, declare that all orders made, decisions taken, and other acts done under those laws, should be valid and enforceable and those laws, which could not without danger to the State be removed from the existing legal system, Should be treated as part of the law of the land until the question of their validation was determined by the new Constituent Convention.  ",
      "89. Next case of significant relevance is the Reference HE The Governor-General reported in PLD 1955 FC 435 . The Federal Court having held in Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan case that assent of the Governor-General was necessary to all laws passed by the Constituent Assembly, the Governor-General sought to validate such Acts by indicating his ascent, with retrospective operation, by means of the Emergency Powers Ordinance, 1955(Ordinance No, IX of 1955) issued under section 42 of the Government of India Act, 1935 . The Federal Court in Usif Patel s case, however, declared that the Acts mentioned in the Schedule to that Ordinance could not be validated under section 42 of the Government of the India Act, 1935, nor could retrospective effect be given to them. A noteworthy fact was that the Constituent Assembly had ceased to function, hav- ing already been dissolved by the Governor-General by a Proclamation on 24th October 1954, and no legislature competent to validate these Acts was in existence.  ",
      "88. The Federal Court held that the Acts men- tioned in the Schedule to the above Order could not be validated by the Governor-General under section 42 of the 1935, Act nor could retrospective effect be given to them. A noleworthy fact was that the Constituent Assembly, having already been dis- solved by the Governor-General by a Proclamation on October 24, 1954 had ceased to function and no legislature competent to validate these Acts was i? existence. In conclusion, the Court observed as:— <br> “it might have been expected that con formably with the attitude taken before us by the responsible counsel for the Crown the first concern of the Government would have been bring into existence another representative bods to exercise the powers of Constituent Assembly so that all invalid legislation could have bee! immediately validated by the new body, Such! course would have been consistent with the con- stitution practice in relation to such a situation. fvents, however, show that other counsels have since prevailed. The Ordinance contains no ref- erence to elections, and all that the learned Advocate General can say is that there intended to be held.”  ",
      "87. Since the Amendment Act of 1948 was not presented to the Governor-General for his assent. it did not have the effect of extending the date from 31st March, 1948 to 31st March, 1949 and that since section 92A was added to the Government of India Act, 1935 after 31st March, 1948, 1t never became g valid provision of that Act. Thus, the Governor- General had no authority to act under section 92A and the Governor derived no power to Icgislate from a Proclamation under that section. Accordingly, the Sind Goondas Act was ultra vires and no action under it could be taken against the appellants. That being so, it was argued, the detention of the appel- lants in jail was illegal.  ",
      "86. The matter came up in appeal before the Federal Court where the questions requiring deter- mination were as under :— <br> “(1) Whether the Governor-General could by an Ordinance validate the Indian Independence (Amendment) Act, 1948; and <br> (2) Whether the Governor-General could give assent to constitutional legislation made by the Constituent Assembly with retrospective effect”.  It was held that a legislature could not validate an invalid law if it did not possess the power to leg- islate on the subject to which the invalid law related, the principle governing validation being that valida- tion being itself legislation one could not validate what one could not legislate upon. The essence of a federal legislature was that it was not a sovereign legislature competent to make laws on all matters, in particular it could not, unless specifically empow- ered by the Constitution, legislate on matters which were assigned by the Constitution to other bodies. Nor was it competent to remove the limitations imposed by the Constitution on its legislative pow- crs. The power of the legislature of the dominion for   the purpose of making provision as to the constitu-, tion of the Domination could, under Subsection (1) of section 8 of the Indian Independence Act. 1949 be exercised only by the Constituent Assembly, and that such power could not be exercised by that Assembly when it functioned as the Federal Legislature within the limits imposed upon it by the Government of India Act, 1935 . The Governor. General could not by an Ordinance, repeal ANY pro. vision of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 o; the Government of India Act, 1935 and assume Unto himself all powers of legislation.  ",
      "85. By means of the Emergency Powers Ordinance, 1955 (Ordinance No. 1X of 1955) issued  under section 42 of the Government of India Act, 1935 the Governor-General sought to validate all those Acts by indicating his assent with retrospec- tive operation. The ground urged before the Chief Court on which their imprisonment was alleged to be illegal was that the Governor’s Act under which action had been taken against them was invalid because it was passed by the Governor in exercise of the powers which were conferred on him by a Proclamation issued by the Governor-General under section 92A of the Government of India Act, 1935, which section had been inserted in the Government of India Act, 1935 by an Order of the Governor- General under section 9 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 . It was contended that this action of the Governor-General was ultra vires the provisions of the aforesaid section 9 . The contention was repelled by the Chief Court and the detentions of the peti- tioners were held legal.  ",
      "84. The next case of constitutional importance was Usif Patel vs Crown [PLD 1955 FC 387 = 7 DLR (FC) 385]. The appellants in that case were proceeded against under the Sindh Control of Goondas Act, 1952 . They were declared as goondas were directed to furnish heavy security but they hav- ing failed to give security, were confined to prison. Against their detention in prison, they approached the Sind Chief Court by an application under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 alleg- ing that their imprisonment was wrongful and prayed that they be set at liberty. Some of the peti- tioners moved revision petitions under section 17 of the aforesaid Act before the Chief Court.  ",
      "83. However, in his dissenting judgment, Cornelius J, (later CJ) held that there was nothing in section 6(3) of the Indian Independence Act, or to the status of Pakistan as a Dominion which created the obligation that all laws made by the Constituent Assembly of a constitutional nature, required the assent of the Governor-General for their validity and operation. Thus, by majority, the dissolution of the Assembly was upheld on a legal ground. As to the merits of the case, it was observed that it was whol- ly unnecessary to go into the other issues and noth- ing said in the judgment was to be taken as an expression of opinion on anyone of those issues.  ",
      "82. The first major event in this behalf in erst- while Pakistan was the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan by Governor- General Ghulam Muhammad in 1954, which he did on the following grounds:— <br> “(1) The Governor-General having consid- ered the political crisis with which the country is faced, has with deep regret some to the con- clusion that the constitutional machinery has broken down. He, therefore, has decided to declare a state of emergency throughout Pakistan. The Constituent Assembly as at pres- ent constituted has lost the confidence of the people and can no longer function. <br> .(2) The ultimate authority vests in the peo- ple who will decide all issues including consti- tutional issues through their representatives to be elected afresh. Elections will be held as early as possible. <br> (3) Until such time as elections are held, the administration of the country will be carried on by a reconstituted Cabinet. He has called upon the Prime Minister to reform the Cabinet with a view to giving the country a vigorous and stable  administration. The invitation has been accept- ed and <br> (4) The security and stability of the country ate of paramount importance. All personal sec- tional and provisional interests must be subordi- nated to the supreme national interest.”  This Act of the Governor-General was chal- ed by Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan, President of the Constituent Assembly, in the Chief Court of  Sindh, the Chief Court of Sindh allowed the peti- tion and declared the dissolution of the Assembly as illigal.  It was held that the Acts of the Constituent  Assembly when it did not function as the Federal legislature did not require the Governor-General’s assent. The Federation of Pakistan challenged the judgment of the Sindh Chief Court before the Federal Court. The Federal Court reversed the jude- ment of the Sindh Chief Court on the ground that the assent of the Governor-General was necessary for the validity of all the laws and the amendments made in the Government of India Act, 1935 . The Court held that since section 223A of the  Government of India Act under which the Chief Court of Sindh assumed jurisdiction to issue the writs did not receive assent of the Governor- General, it was not yet law, and that, therefore, the Chief Court had no jurisdiction to issue the writs.  ",
      "81. Before discussing the above questions, let us  get a clear picture of the major constitutional devel-  opments In erstwhile Pakistan and also in present n and decision of the Supreme Court of pakistan regarding Martial Law. Earlier we have noted the relevant portion of the judgment of yaqub Ali J in Asma Jilani’s case in this regard but e same Is not that elaborate.   ",
      "80. Next question is whether in view of the pro- visions of Article 111 of the Constitution, the deci- sions of this Division passed in the cases of Halima Khatun, Joynal Abedin, Ehteshamuddin, and Nasiruddin to the effect that Martial Law proclama- tions etc. were supra constitutional instrumen!s and as such the Constitution must take a back seat, is binding upon the High Court Division.  ",
      "79. Coming back to Bangladesh, Mustafa Kamal, CJ, was emphatic in respect of the mm pendence of Judiciary in Secretary, Ministry of Finance vs Masdar Hossain 2000 BLT (AD) 231 where his Lordship held at para 60, Pages-263.4.  <br> “60 . when Parliament and the executive instead of implementing the provisions of Chapter I] of Part VI follow a different course not sanctioned by the Constitution, the higher Judiciary is within its jurisdiction to bring back the Parliament and the executive from constitu- tional derailment and give necessary directions to follow the constitutional course.  This exercise was made by this Court in the case of Kudrat-e-Elahi Panir vs Bangladesh, 44 DLR (AD) 319 . We do not see why the High Court Division or this Court cannot repeat that exercise when a constitutional deviation ts detected and when there is a constitutional man- date to implement certain provisions of the Constitution.” <br> It is thus clear that the High Court Division has not only the power of judicial review of an Act of Parliament but also has a duty to exercise such power in case of violation of the Constitution. And the High Court Division did it giving reasons.  ",
      "78. His Lordship then considered the powers of the Court in respect of the Constitutional measure at page-71: <br> “I for my part cannot conceive of a situa- tion, in which, after a formal written Constitution has been lawfully adopted by a competent body and has been generally accept- ed by the people including the judiciary as the Constitution of the country, the judiciary can claim to declare any of its provisions ultra vires or void. This will be no part of its function of interpretation. Therefore, in my view, however solemn or sacrosanct a document, if it is not Incorporated in the Constitution or does not form 4 part thereof it cannot control the Constitution. At any rate, the Courts created under the Constitution will not have the power lo declare any provision of the Constitution  itself as being in violation of such a document Ifin fact, that document contains the expression of the will of the vast majority of tho people then the remedy for correcting such 4 violation will lie with the people and not with the judici- ary”  ",
      "77. Hamoodur Rahman, CJ explains the legal position thus in State vs Zia-ur-Rahman PLD 1973 <br> “In exercising this powel, the judiciary claims no supremacy over other organs: of the Government but acts only as the administrator of the public will. Even when it declares a leg- islative measure unconstitutional and void, ut does not do so, because, the judicial power Is superior in degree Or dignity to power; but because the Constitution has vested it with the power to declare what the law 1s In the cases, which come before it. It thus merely enforces the Constitution as a paramount law whenever a legislative enactment comes into conflict with it because, it is its duty to see that the Constitution prevails. It is only when the Legislature fails to keep within its own Constitutional limits, the judiciary steps in to enforce compliance with the Constitution. This is no doubt a delicate task as pointed out in the case of Fazlul Ouader Chowdhury vs Shah Newaz, which has to be performed with great circumspection but it has nevertheless to be per- formed as a sacred Constitutional duty when other State functionaries disregard the limita- tions imposed upon them or claim to exercise  power which the people have been careful to withhold from them.”  ",
      "76. This is how the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary functions under the Constitutional scheme in Bangladesh. The Constitution is the undoubted source of all powers and functions of all three grand Departments of the Republic, just like the United States, Pakistan and India. It is true that like the Supreme Courts in the United States or in India, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has got the power of review of both legislative and executive actions but such power of review would not place the Supreme Court with any higher position to those of the other two Branches of the Republic. The Supreme Court is the creation of the Constitution just like the Legislature and the Executive. But the Constitution endowed the Supreme Court with such power of judicial review and since the Judges of the Supreme Court have taken oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, they are obliged and duty bound to declare and strike down any provision of law which is inconsistent with the Constitution without any fear or favour to anybody. This includes the power to declare any provision seeking to oust the jurisdiction of the Court, as uitra vires the  Constitution.  ",
      "75. In this part of the world we generally follow the common law principles but Bangladesh has got a written Constitution. This Constitution may be termed as controlled or rigid but in contradistinction to a Federal form of Government, as in the United States, it has a Parliamentary form of Government within limits set by the Constitution. Like the United States, its three grand Departments, ‘the Legislature makes, the Executive executes and judiciary con- _ Strues the law’ (Chief Justice Marshall). But the _ Bangladesh Parliament lacks the omnipotence of the : British Parliament while the President is not the executive head like the US President but the Prime . Minister is, like British Prime Minister. However,  all the functionaries of the Republic owe their exis- tence, powers and functions to the Constitution. \"We the people of Bangladesh’. gave themselves this Constitution which is conceived of as 2 fundamental or an organic or a Supreme Law nising lofty high above all other laws in the country and Article 7(2) expressly spelt out that any law which is inconsis- tent with this Constitution, to that extent of the inconsistency, is void. As such, the provisions of the Constitution is the basis on which the vires of all other existing laws and those passed by the Legislature as well as the actions of the Executive. are to be judged by the Supreme Court, under Its power of judicial review. This power of judicial review of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is, sim- ilar to those in the United States, Pakistan and in India.  ",
      "74. Thus there is no hesitation in saying that these are the words of wisdom handed down to us by the generations of Judges who very politely and meekly from the beginning of the civilisation reminded the monarch that the King is not above the law but under the law. Some of them were behead- ed, imprisoned or destroyed but the cherished theme ran like a refrain throughout the pages of the histo- ry.  ",
      "73. About the independence of judiciary and its  power of judicial review, BH Chowdhury, J, in the above case further observed, quoting Bhagwati, J  and Justice Krishna Iyer, J at para- 240-241, page- 105: <br> “240 . This point may now be considered. Independence of judiciary is not an abstract | conception. Bhagwati, J said “if there 1s one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it is the judict- ary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the law and thereby making the rule of law a mea’ ingful and effective”. He said that the Judges must uphold the core principle of the rule ©! law, which says, “Be you ever so high, the !a’ is above you”. This is the principle of inde- pendence of the judiciary, which is vital for the establishment of real participatory democracy maintenance of the rule of law as a dynamic concept and delivery of social justice to the vul- nerable sections of the Community. It is principle of independence of the judiciary which must be kept in mind while interpreting the relevant provisions of the Constitutions Gupta vs President of India ALR 1982 SOD 241 . He further says, “what is necessary is  to have Judges who are prepared to fashion new tools, forge new methods, innovate new strate- gies and evolve a new jurisprudence, who are judicial statesmen with a social vision and a cre- ative faculty and who have, above all, a deep sense of commitment to the Constitution with a activist approach and obligation for accounta- bility, not to any party in power nor to the oppo- Sition .......... We need Judges who are alive to the socio-economic realities of Indian life, who are anxious to wipe every tear from every eye, who have faith in the constitutional values and who are ready to use law as an instrument for achieving the constitutional objectives (at page 179). He quoted the eloquent words of Justice Krishna Iyer : <br> “Independence of the judiciary is not genu- flexion; nor is it opposition to every proposition of Government. It is neither judiciary made to opposition measure nor Government’s pleasure”.  ",
      "72. When King said that he thought the law Was founded on reasons and that he and others had reasons as well as Judges, Coke answered :-—  “True it was that God has endowed his Majesty with excellent science and great endowments of nature, but his Majesty Was not learned in the law of his realm in England, and causes which concemed the life or Inheritance, or good or fortune of his subject, are not to be decided by natural reasons, but by the Artificia| reasons and judgment of the law, which law is an act which requires long study and experi- ence, before that a man can attain the Cog nizance of it, and the law was the golden metawand one and measure to try the causes of the subject and which protect his Majesty in  safety and peace”.   ",
      "71. In this connection a historical episode was narrated by BH Chowdhury, J. in Anwar Hossain Chowdhury s case at para-253, page-108 (BLD) :— <br>  “253 . This judgment will be incomplete if a historical episode is not mentioned. Sir Coke was summoned by King James first to answer why the King could not himself decide cases  which has to go before his own court of Justice Sir Coke asserted:   “No King after the conquest assumed him- self to give any judgment in any cause whatso- ever which concerned the administration of jus lice within the realm but these are solely d . : mined in the court of Justice,”   ",
      "70. It may be mentioned here that under our Constitution all the powers and functions of the Republic are vested in the three branches, namely, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. All these branches, however, owe their existence to the Constitution since it is the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh. It is the people of Bangladesh, who proclaimed that ‘We, the people of Bangladesh’, deemed that there shall be a Supreme Court for Bangladesh, that is why this Court came into being out of Article 94 of the Constitution with all the powers of a High Tribunal as exists in the civilised world.  ",
      "69. As such it 1s apparent that the Court may consider. the constitutionality of any provision in course of a litigation brought before it. Further it 1S not for the aggrieved persons lo plead law but for the Judges to apply the correct provisions of the Constitution and the laws made there under and if necessary under the circumstances, IS entitled either to uphold any particular statute or to declare it invalid being, contradictory to the Constitution so long the Government gets adequate opportunity to support the offending provision if so advised. This is the position ‘1 the United States, so also in India ‘and there is no reason why it should be otherwise in Bangladesh.    ",
      "68. Hatnoodur Rahman, C], in dealing with  Martial Law provision in Asma Jilcmi ’3 case held at page -202: '  “However, as this question has been raised. regarding the validity of Martial Law Regulation No. 78, I must point out that it to!- lows from what I have said earlier that it was made by an authority whose legal competence we have not been able to recognise on the ground ()Fw:‘ttit ol'legal authority and the uncou- slitutional manner ol‘ arrogation ol‘ power.“ any provision sought to     The moral is clear. if any provision sought to oust the jurisdiction of Court that provision itself is not law.  ",
      "67. This was also indicated by AR Cornelius,  C], in Fazlul 'Quader Chowd/mry vs Muhamnmd Abdul Hague PLD 1963 SC 486, at page-503:  “The duty of interpreting the Constitution is, in a fact a duty of enforcing the provisions of the Constitution in any particular case brought before the Courts in the form of litigation.”  ",
      "66. O Hood Phillips in his ‘Constitutional and  Administrative Law’, Seventh Edition (1987), explains the mechanism at page-8: <br> “. . ...the Federal Courts have jurisdiction to declare provisions of state constitutions, state legislation and federal legislation repugnant to the Federal Constitution. It is not strictly accu- rate to say that the Courts declare legislation void: when cases are brought before them judi- cially, they may declare that an alleged right or power does not exist or that an alleged wrong has been committed because a certain statute relied on is unconstitutional.”  ",
      "65. Robert K Carr tried to visualize the mind- set of Chief Justice Marshall, a great Chief Justice-of  the Supreme Court of the United States, in its infan- cy in this manner:  “In other words, Marshall was invoking that power for the ﬁrst time at just such a moment when the Fathers probably intended it should be exercised. Jefferson had become President and his party had won control of Congress. The Opposition had obtained complete control of the political branches of the government. 15 it not obvious that from the point of view of the Founding Fathers and the Federalist Party the time had come to point out that the Constitution as a higher law did place restraints upon Congress and that the Supreme Court as guardian of the Constitution had power to enforce those restraints?  In Mai-billy vs Madison we see Chief Justice Marshall suggesting that the Supreme Court was duty-bound as a matter of inescapable principle to enforce the Constitution as a symbol of restraint upon congressional authority through the exercise of its power of judicial review ........ ” (Quoted from Robert K. Carr on ‘The Supreme Court and Judicial Review’ at page- 71).  This is how the review was made two hun- dred years ago in Marbury vs Madison:  “If an act ofthe legislature, repugnant to the Constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be  not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as ifit was a law?  .............. It is emphatically the province  and duty of the judicial department to say what  the law is.  ........... The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution.  Could it be the intention of those who gave this power, to say that in using it the constitution should not be looked into? That a case arising under the constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it rises?  This is too extravagant to be maintained ........ Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essen- tial to all written constitutions, that a law repug- nant to the constitution is void; and that courts, as well as other 'LlCPttltlUCIltS, are bound by that instrument.”(Quoted from Professor Noet T.  Dowling on the ‘Cases on Constitutional Law Fifth Edition, 1954, at pages—95-97).  It will be interesting to note that Marbury was not at all interested in the supremacy of the  Constitution or the Supreme Court’s power at   jUdicial review. He only made a request for man- datnus upon Madison, the Secretary of State. directing him to deliver his commission, which was ready in all respect but could not be deliv- ered to him earlier due to paucity of time. But the Supreme Court in course of considering his grievance, very consciously declared invalid an Act of the Congress. This is how the US  Supreme Court wields its power of judicial review oflegislative actions.  "

Accordingly though the petitions involve Constitutional issues, leave, as prayed for, cannot be granted as the points raised in the leave petitions have been authoritatively decided by superior Courts as have been reflected in the judgment of the High Court Division.  We, therefore, sum up as under:<br> 1.Both the leave petitions are dismissed: <br> 2.The judgment of the High Court Division is approved subject to the following modifica- tions:— <br> (a) All the findings and observations in respect of Article 150 and the Fourth Schedule in the judgment of the High Court Division are hereby expunged. and th> validation of Article 95 is not approved; <br> 3 . In respect of condonation made by the High Court Division, the following modifica- tion is made and condonations are made as under: <br> (a) all executive acts, things and deeds done and actions taken during the period from 15th August 1975 to 9th April, 1979 which are past and closed; <br> (b) the actions not derogatory to the rights of the citizens; <br> (c) all acts during that period which tend 1o advance or promote the welfare of the people; <br> (d)all routine works done during the above period which even the lawful government could have done.  <br> (e) (i) the Proclamation dated 8th November, 1975 so far it relates to - omitting  Part VIA of the Constitution; <br> (ii) the Proclamations (Amendment) Order 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) relating to Article 6  of the Constitution.               <br> (iii) the Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. 1V of 1976) and the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 (Second Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977) so far it relates to amendment of English text of Article 44 of the Constitution; <br> (iv) the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No.IV of 1978) so far it relates to substituting Bengali text of Article 44; <br> (v) The Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 (Second Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977) so far it relates to inserting Clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Article 96 i.e. provisions relating to Supreme Judicial Council and also clause (1) of Article 102 of the Constitution, and <br> (f) all acts and legislative measures which are in accordance with, or could have been made under the original Constitu- tion. <br> While dismissing the leave petitions we are put- ting on record our total disapproval of Martial Law and suspension of the Constitution or any part there- of in any form. The perpetrators of such illegalities should also be suitably punished and condemned so that in future no adventurist, no usurper, would dare to defy the people, their Constitution, their Govern- ment, established by them with their consent. However, it is the Parliament, which can make law in this regard. Let us bid farewell to all kinds of extra constitutional adventure forever.  APPELLATE DIVISION  (Criminal) Md Fazlul Karim CJ | State............

      "243. We are of the view that in the spirit of the Preamble and also Article 7 of the Constitution the Military Rule, direct or indirect, is to be shunned once for all. Let it be made clear that Military Rule was wrongly justified in the past and it ought not to be justified in future on any ground, principle, doc- trine or theory whatsoever as the same is against the dignity, honour and glory of the nation that it achieved afier great sacrifice; it is against the digni- ty and honour of the people of Bangladesh who are committed to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of the nation by all means; it is also against the hon- our of each and every soldier of the Armed Forces who are oath bound to bear true faith and allegiance to Bangladesh and uphold the Constitution which embodies the will of the people, honestly and faith- fully to serve Bangladesh in their respective servic- es and also see that the Constitution is upheld, it is not kept in suspension, abrogated, it is not subvert- ed, it is not mutilated, and to say the least it is not held in abeyance and it is not amended by any authority not competent to do so under the Constitution.  ",
      "242. We would also quote the following pas- sage from the conclusion in an essay on Noni Palkivala in ....oooviiininnn “Democracy, Human rights and Rule of Law™ edited by Venkat lyer , 2000 regarding the “Period of Delinquency\" in India  in 1975 -1977: <br> Despite the traumatic events of 1995 - 1977, the lessons of that emergency have now, alas, also been forgotten by a vast majority of Indian citizenry. It is said that people do not                 realize the benefits of freedom until they are lost. Twenty-five ycars have passed and a new generation of Indians is not even aware of what happened during those cventful months. <br> It is essential that if India is to preserve her democratic freedom, cach generation must be taught, cducated and informed about those dark days. Every Indian needs to renew and refresh himself at the springs of freedom. ' <br> We will simply echo those words by replacing the period and the word India with Bangladesh, We emphasize cach of our generation must be taught, edu- cated and informed about those dark days: the easiest way of doing this is to recognize our errors of the past and reflect this sentiments in our judgment. This will  ensure that the sovereignty of “we, the people of  Bangladesh” is preserved forever as a “ pole star”.  ",
      "241. Before we conclude, we would like to quote the following: <br> “The greatest of all the means .......... for ensuring the stability of Constitution-but which is now a days generally neglected is the educa- tion of citizens in the spirit of the Constitution ............ To live by the rule of the Constitution ought not to be regarded as slavery, but rather as salvation.” (Aristotle’s Politics (335-322 BC) pp 233-34”  ",
      "240. It is our Earnest hope that Articles 115 and 116 of the Constitution will be restored to their original position by the Parliament as soon as possible  ",
      "230. It was further observed:— <br> “we agree, with approval, with Justice Bhagvati and add further that although Article 92 has been implemented to a great extent through the judgment of this Court in Masdar Hossain's case but until and unless the unmend- ed Articles 115 and 116 of the Constitution are restored vesting the control of the subordinate judiciary in the Supreme Court, the separation of judiciary will remain a distant cry and a music of the distant drum” <br> It may be noted here that among the twelve  directions given in Masdar Hossains case one was to the effect that Parliament will in its wisdom take necessary steps regarding this aspect of independence of judiciary.   ",
      "238. In this regard, Matin, J in Judges Case /7 BLT (AD) 231 observed as follows: <br> “it is true that “consultation” was consid- ered in the light of Article 116 of the Constitution but never the less the same princi- ple all the more applies in the matter of appoint- ment of Judges of the Supreme Court under Articles 95 and 98 of the Constitution because without the independence of the Supreme Court there cannot be any independence of the subor- dinate Courts and minus the consultation and p.rimacy the separation of judiciary from execu- tive will be empty words........     ",
      "237.  As it appears Mustafa Kamal, CJ was emphatic in respect of the independence of the judi- ciary in Secretary of Finance vs Masdar Hossain 2000 BLT (4D) 23¢ wherein he held in para 44, page  257 — 258 as follows: <br> “44_ The independence of the judiciary, as affirmed and declared by Articles 94(4) and 116A . is one of the basic pillars of the Constitution and cannot be demolished, whit- tled down, curtailed or diminished in any man- ner whatsoever, except under the existing provi- sion of the Constitution. It is true that this inde- pendence, as emphasized by the learned Attorney-General , is subject to the provision of  the Constitution, but we find no provision in the Constitution which curtails, demolishes to oth- erwise abridges this independence...... N <br> However we are of the view that the words, “but we find no provision in the Constitution which curtzils, demolishes or otherwise abridges this inde- pendence” do not depict the actual picture because unless Articles 115 and 116 are restored to their original position, independence of judiciary will not be fully achieved.  ",
      "236. However, before concluding we would like to mention that our decision will remain incom- plete if we do not mention the present state of the Jjudiciary in the Constitution.  ",
      "975. However, in view of the declarations given in the Judges case (Supra) declaring that convention of consultation being, a Constitutional imperative, is binding upon everybody. Accordingly this retention of substituted Article 95 will have no bearing on the matter of consultation.               ",
      "235.  As it appears Article 95 of the Constitu- tion, relates to the appointment of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, The above Article 95 as it stood after the amendment made by the Second Proclamation (Seventh Amend- ment) Order, 1976 has been retained by the High Court Division. The above Order, amongst others, changed Article 95 of the Constitution relating to the appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court. This amendment of Article 95 commensurate with the Original Article 95 which existed before the enactment of the Fourth Amendment wherein there was provision for the appointment of the Judges by the President “after consultation with the Chief Justice™. But this con- sultative provision as provided by Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment Order 1977) was deleted by the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 . Accordingly, after the amendment of the amended Article 95 by the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order. 1977, Article 95 as amended by the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976, did no longer exist, and therefore, it was not ratified or validated or confirmed by the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly this Article 95 as amended by the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976 could not be legally condoned by the High Court Division as it was not in force on the day the Fifth Amendment was passed. Moreso, a repealed provision cannot be legally retained alid/or validated by the Court. So Article 95 will remain as it existed on August 15, 1",
      "234. It also appears that Part VIA of the Constitution under the heading ‘THE NATIONAL PARTY’ incorporating Article 117A was added by the Fourth Amendment. However in a democratic system the existence of different political parties and their participation in the parliamentary election cannot be denied because such participation would flourish the democracy in the country, Further this Article 117A is also inconsistent with Articles 37, 38, 39 of the Constitution. However this provision has been deleted by the Proclamation dated 8th November, 1975 . Accordingly this portion of the above Proclamation needs to be condoned.  ",
      "233. Earlier while discussing the different Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations and Orders we found that under the Constitution of 1972 the High Court Division, under original Article 102(1), had powers to pass necessary orders to enforce fun- damental rights. It may be noted here that this power of the High Court Division is not discretionary and whenever an authority acts illegally or commits an error of law or a citizen’s fundamental right is vio- lated, the remedy under this article can be availed of. This sub-article (1) of Article 102 though was delet- ed by the Fourth Amendment has been restored by the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 . The above restoration of sub-article (1) of Article 102, being beneficial, should be condoned for the wider public interest.  ",
      "232. It also appears that the provision of Article 96 as existed in the Constitution on August 15, 1975 provided that a Judge of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh may be removed from the office by the President on the ground of “misbehavior or incapac- ity”. However clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Article 96 were substituted by the Second Procla- mation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 providing the procedure for removal of a Judge of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh by the Supreme Judicial Council in the manner provided therein instead of earlier method of removal. This substituted provisions being more transparent procedure than that of the earlier ones and also safeguarding independence of judici- ary, are to be condoned.  ",
      "231. As it appears Part 11 of the Constitution enumerates a host of fundamental rights in which the framers of the Constitution made the right to move the Supreme Court of Bangladesh for enforce- ment of fundamental rights itself a fundamental right. But as discussed earlier, the same was substi- tuted by the Fourth Amendment providing that the “Parliament may by law establish a Constitutional Court, Tribunal or Commission for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this part™. But the English Text of this Article was substituted by the Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976 and the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 and the Bengali Text was substituted by the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendmenl') Order, 1978 and by these amendments the original Article 44 was restored. As a result a citizen of               Bangladesh is entitled to move the High Court division under Article 102 for the enforcement of (he rights conferred in Part 111, This substitution of Article 44, no doubt, was designed to advance rule of law and the welfare of the people and according- ly it needs to be retained for the interest of justice.  ",
      "230. The other modifications that we want to make are in respect of the following provisions of the Constitution.  ",
      "229. Now regarding the modifications of the judgment and order of the High Court Division it may be nolcd that ear- lier to avoid the hardship that the people may suffer, we are inclined to condone the substituted provision of Article 6 of the Constitution. We have also expunged the findings of  the High Court Division made in respect of Article 150 of the Constitution and the Fourth Schedule tak- ing in view of the subsequent development.  ",
      "228. A question has been raised as to whether the High Court Division can exercise the “legisla- tive p()wcr\" by way of condonation. But it is now settled to avoid anomaly and also to preserve conti- nuity, the Courts have to pass consequential orders. No exception can be taken to it. Ilustrations of such judicial power may be found in the Eighth Amend- ment case wherein the Appellant Division ordered prospective application of the invalidity of the Eighth Amendment. Further while declaring any law wltra vires, the Court often applies the doctrine of severability to limit the application of the judicial verdict. This is no legislative act though such a deci- sion modifies or even destroys a legislation.  ",
      "227. It also appears that by the Fifth Amend- ment, amongst others, the following changes were made. <br>  (1)Omission of Part VIA of the Constitution dealing with one party system as intro- duced by the Fourth Amendment. The above omission was made by Proclamation dated 8th November of 1975. <br> (2)Partial restoration of the independence of judiciary (Article 95 and 116) as made by the Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order 1976 . Independence of judiciary was curtailed by the Fourth Amendment. <br> (3)Restoration of the jurisdiction of the High Court Division to enforce fundamental rights as was provided in original Articles 44 and 102 of the Constitution. The same was made by the Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order 1976. <br> (4)Insertion of the provision of Supreme Judicial Council in respect of security of tenure of the judges of the Supreme Court (Article 96). The same was made by Proclamation Order No.l of 1977. <br> (5)Abolition of the provision of absolute veto power of the President as introduced by the Fourth Amendment (Article 80). The same was made by the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order 1978. <br> (6)Introduction of the provision of referen- dum in respect of amendment of certain provisions of the Constitution. The same                was made by Second Proclamation Order (Fifteenth Ahmed) 1978 by inserting sub- articles (1A), (1B) and (1C) in Article 142, <br> (7)The insertion of the words “Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim” at the beginning of the Constitution i.e. above the Preamble. <br> (8)Amending the original Article 6 of the Constitution which provided that the citi- zens of Bangladesh would be known as ‘Bengalees’ by the substituted Article 6 providing that citizens of Bangladesh would- be known as ‘Bangladeshis’. Further original Article 9 of the Constitu- tion, which provided for unity and soli- darity of the Bengalee nation, was also substituted by a new Article providing promoting local governmental institution. The same was done by Proclamation Order No.1 of 1977. <br> (9)Omission of secularism as was provided in original Article 8(1) of the Constitution which declared that the principles of nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism shall constitute the fundamen- tal principles of State Policy; addition of the words “the principle of absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah™ in Article 8(1) and also the insertion of a new sub article (1A) containing the words “Absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions” after amended Article 8(1). The above was made by Proclamation Order No.l of 1977. <br> (10)Giving new explanation to “Socialism” as mentioned in original Article 8(1), one of four major fundamental principles of State Policy, to the effect that socialism would mean only economic and social justice.  <br> (11)Substitution of original Article 10 of the Constitution which guaranteed democra-                cy and human rights by a new Article pro- viding “Participation of women in nation- al life” which has no nexus with the orig- inal Article 9. <br> (12) Omission of the proviso t0 Article 38 from the original Constitution which pro-  vided as follows:— <br> “Provided that no person shall ha right to form, of be a member or other-  wise take part in the activities of, any communal or other association or union which in the name or on the basis of any religion has for its object, or pursuces, a political purpose.” The same Was made by the Second Proclamation (Sixth  Amendment) Order 1976. <br> (13) Addition of new Article 92A giving the President the power to expend public moneys in certain cases even without the approval of the Parliament. The said Article 92A was inserted in the Constitution by the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order 1978.  <br> (14) Inserting of another new Article 145A providing that all international treaties would be submitted to the President who should cause them to be laid before Parliament by second proclamation. The said Article 145A was inserted in the Constitution by the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order 1978. <br> (15) Amendment of Article 58 of the Constitution providing that four-fifih of the total number of ministers should be taken from among the members of Parlia- ment and that the President would appoint as Prime Minister a member of parliament who appeared to him to com- mand the support of the majority of the members of parliament. The same was made by the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order 1978.    ",
      "226. As it appears, the High Court Division accepted the doctrine of condonation as was done in Asma Jilani’s case and in order to avoid chaos and confusion in the society and preserve continuity condoned all acts and thins and proceedings taken during the period from August 15, 1975 to April 9, 1979 as past and closed transactions and in para 21 of its summery the High Court Division condoned all the provisions which deleted the various provi- sions of the Fourth Amendment.  As it appears, by the Fourth Amendment,  amongst others, <br> (1) In place of Parliamentary system, Presidential system was introduced by substituting chapter I and II of Part IV of the Constitution, <br> (2)The impeachment and removal of the President was made tougher.  <br> (3)The power of the Parliament was reduced by amending Article 80. <br> (4)The power of the High Court Division to  enforce fundamental rights was curtailed by substituting Article 44.                 (5) The independence of judiciary was cur- tailed by amending Article 95.  (6)One-party political system was intro- duced by adding part VIA in the Constitu- tion.  ",
      "225. Regarding condonation, the High Court Division, in paragraphs 18-21 of the summary, held  as follows:— <br> “18 . The turmoil or crisis in the country is no excuse for any violation of the constitution or its deviation on any pretext. Such turmoil or crisis must be faced and quelled within the ambit of the Constitution and the laws made there under, by the concerned authorities, estab- lished under the law for such purpose. <br> 19 . Violation of the Constitution is a grave legal wrong and remains so for all time to come. It cannot be legitimized and shall remain illegit- imate forever, however, on the necessary of the State only, such legal wrongs can be condoned in certain circumstances, invoking the maxims, Id quod Alias Non Est Licitum. Necessitas Licitum Facit, salus populi est suprema lex and salus republicae est suprema lex. <br> 20 . As such, all acts and things done and actions and proceedings taken during the period from August 15, 1975 to April 9, 1979, are con- doned as past and closed transactions, but such condonations are made not because those are legal but only in the interest of the Republic in order to avoid chaos and confusion in the socie- ty, although distantly apprehended, however, those remain illegitimate and void forever. <br> 21 . Condonations of provisions were made, among others, in respect of provisions, deleting the various provisions of the Fourth Amend- ment but no condonation of the provisions was allowed in respect of omission of any provision enshrined in the original Constitution. The Preamble Articles 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,25, 38 and 142 remain as it was in the original Constitution. No condonation is allowed in respect of change of any of these provisions of the Constitution. Besides, Article 95, as amended by the Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976, is declared  valid and retained.”  ",
      "224. Then the High Court Division concluded  as follows: <br> We provisionally condone the various pro- visions of the Proclamations with amendments as appended to the book, namely, the Constitu- tion of the People Republic of Bangladesh; pub- lished by the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary ~ Affairs, ~Government of Bangladesh, as modified upto 31st May, 2000, save and except those mentioned above. But since we have declared the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, wultra vires 10 the Constitution, the vires of the rest of the provi- sions of the Proclamations not considered here- in, remain justifiable before the Court. However, all the acts and proceedings taken thereon, although were not considered yet, are condoned as past and closed transactions. <br> We have held earlier held in general that there was no legal existence of Martial Law and consequently of no Martial Law Authorities, as such, all Proclamations etc. were illegal, void ab initio and non-est in the eye of law. This we have held strictly in accordance with the dic- tates of the Constitution, the supreme law to  which all the Institutions including the Judiciary owe its existence. We are bound to declare what have to be declared, in vindication of our oath taken in accordance with the Constitution, oth- erwise, we ourselves would be violating the Constitution and the oath taken to protect the Constitution and thereby betraying the Nation. We had no other alternative, rather, we are obliged to act strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. <br> The learned Advocates for the petitioners raised the possibility of chaos or confusion that may arise if we declare the said Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the acts taken there under as illegal, void ab initio and non est. We are not unmindful of such an apprehension although unlikely but we have no iota of doubts about the illegalities of those Proclamations etc. What is wrong and illegal shall remain so for ever. There cannot be any acquiescence in case of an ille- gality. It remains illegal for all time to come. A Court of Law cannot extend benefit to the per- petrators of the illegalities by declaring it legit- imate. It remains illegitimate till eternity. The seizure of power by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed and his band of renegades, definitely constituted offences and shall remain so forev- er. No law can legitimize their actions and trans- actions. The Martial Law Authorities in impos- ing Martial Law behaved like an alien force conquering Bangladesh all over again, thereby transforming themselves as usurpers, plain and simple. <br> Be that as it may, although it is very true that illegalities would not make such continu- ance as a legal one but in order to protect the country from irreparable evils flowing from convulsions of apprehended chaos and confu- sion and in bringing the country back to the road map devised by its Constitution, recourse to the doctrine of necessity in the paramount interest of the nation becomes imperative. In such a sit- uation, while holding the Proclamations etc. as illegal and void ab initio, we provisionally con-                done the Ordinances, and provisions of the var- ious Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs save and except those are specifically denied above, on the age old principles, such as, Id quod Alias Non Est Licitum, Necessitas Licitum Facit (That which otherwise is not lawful, necessity makes lawful), Salus populi suprema lex (safe- ty of the people is the supreme law) and salus republicae est suprema lex (safety of the State is  the supreme law). <br> In this connection it may again be remind- ed that those Proclamations etc. were not made by the Parliament but by the usurpers and dicta- tors. To them, we would use Thomas Fullers warning sounded over 300 years ago: Be you ever so high, the law is above you.

      "223. The Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975, changed clause (1) of Article 95 in the following manner : <br> 95 .(1) The Chief Justice and other Judges shall be appointed by the President.......... <br> Article 95(1) was again amended by the Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976) with effect from August 13, 1976, in the following manner:  95 . Appointment of Supreme Court Judges,—(1) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President, and the other Judges shall be appointed by the President after consultation  with the Chief Justice........ <br> This version commensurate with the Article 95  in the original unamended Constitution. <br> But by the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 (Second Proclama- tion Order No. 1 of 1977) again changed Article 95(1) of the Constitution in the following man-ner: <br> 95 . Appointment of Judges— (i) The Chief Justice and other Judges shall be appointed by  the President........ <br> This form of Article 95(1) is exactly the same as made in the Fourth Amendment.  This Order containing Article 95 in this form came into force on 1-12-1977 and remains so in the Constitution till date in view of the Fifth Amendment, without further change™. <br> This Second 'Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order 1977 (Second Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977) containing the latest ver- sion of Article 95 was sought to be protected amongst others firstly by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977), by inserting Paragraph 3A in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution. This was published in the Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary on 23-4-1977 . Secondly, by insertion of Paragraph 18 in the Fourth Schedule by the Constitution (Fifth Amend-  ment) Act, 1979.                Since we have decided that we would approve and condone the amendments made in the Constitution which would repeal the various provisions of the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975, we do not condone the amendment of clause (1) of Article 95 by the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 (Second Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977) which commensurate with Article 95(1) as made in the Fourth Amendment along  with its English Text. <br> This would amount to revival of Article 95(1) as amended by the Second Proclamation  (Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976) <br> ..................................................................... <br> ................................................................. <br> ",
      "222. For retaining Article 95 the High Court Division stated as follows: <br> It may be reiterated that by the Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976), several changes were made with effect from 13-8-1977 in the Constitution as it stood after the Fourth Amendment. One of such changes was in respect of Article 95 of the Constitution. This provision is in respect of appointment of Judges in the Supreme Court. Article 95 in the original Constitution reads as  follows : <br> 95 . (1) The Chief Justice shall be appointed by the President, and the other Jjudges shall be appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice,  ",
      "221. The High Court Division further held as  follows: <br> We have already discussed earlier that the English text of various portion of the Preamble, Article 6, Article 8, Article 9, Article 10 and Article 25 were altogether changed or replaced while Article 12 was completely omitted by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977). This was published in Bangladesh Gazette Extra-ordinary on April 23, 1977 . Besides other changes, a new paragraph with the heading, 3A. validation of certain Proclamations, etc. was inserted after paragraph 3 in the Fourth schedule to the                Constitution. The English text of the proviso to article 38 was omitted by the Second Procla- mation (Sixth Amendment) Order 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. III of 1976). The Bengali text of the above noted all the changes were made by the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978). Besides, clauses 1A, 1B and 1C were added to Article 142 of the Constitution by the above Order No. IV of 1978 . These changes were of fundamental in nature and changed the very basis of our war for liberation and also defaced the Constitution altogether. <br> The very endeavour to change the basic features of the Constitution by the Martial Law Proclamations was illegal, void and non est in the eye of law. By the said Martial law Procla- mations, the secular Bangladesh was trans- formed into a theocratic State and thereby not only changed one of the most basic and funda- mental features of the Constitution but also betrayed one of the dominant cause for the war of liberation of Bangladesh. <br> ..................................................................... <br> The Proclamations (Second Amendment) Order, 1975, dated November 6, 1975, was made, inserting clause (aa) in the Proclamation dated August 20, 1975, providing for nomina- tion of any person as President. <br> The Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, omitted Part VI A of the Constitution (added by the Fourth Amendment). <br> The Second Proclamation (Sixth Amend- ment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. Il of 1976), omitted the following proviso of the original Article 38: <br> «provided that no person shall have the right to form, or be a member or other- wise take part in the activities of, any com- munal or other association of union which in  the name or on the basis of any religion has for its object, or pursues, a political purpose” <br> The Bengali version of the above Proviso was omitted subsequently by the Second Pro- clamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978) 2nd Schedule. <br> The Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclama- tion Order No. IV of 1976), repealed most of the changes brought about by the (Fourth Amend- ment) Act, 1975, save and accept Chapters I and 11 of the Part IV of the Constitution, keeping the Presidntial form of Government, introduced earlier by the Fourth Amendment. The Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1976 came into force with effect from 13-8-1976. <br> The Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations Order No. 1 of 1977) (Annexure-L-1 to the writ petition), replaced many of the paragraphs in the Preamble and in various provisions of the Constitution. The Proclamation was published in Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary on April 23, 1977 . This Proclamation made changes in First and Second Preamble, Articles 6, 8,9, 10, 12, 38, and 142 of the Constitution , which has been stated earlier . <br> “Excepting Article 42, these are the basic  - changes in the structure of the Constitution and  cannot even be done by the Parliament itself, and as such, the question of ratification, confirmation or validation of those changes does not arise. <br> Besides, by the above noted Proclamation, by the amendment of Article 6, our identity of thousand years as Bangalee was changed into Bungladeshis. Since the said change was made by a Martial Law Proclamation, it was without jurisdiction and non-est in the eye of law, as such, there was nothing to ratify confirm or val- idate by the subsequent Act of Parliament......... <br> ............................................................................ <br> .................................................................. <br>               Under the circumstances, we deny condonation of both Bengali and English texts of the following provisions made in the Constitution by the various Proclamations : <br> (1) The Amendments made in the Preamble of the Constitution <br> (2) Article6<br> (3) Artcle 8<br> (4) Article 9<br> (5) Article 10<br> (6) Article 12<br>  (7) Artcle 25 <br> (8) Proviso to Article 38 <br> (9) Clauses 1A, 1B and 1C to Article 142 <br> (10) Paragraph 3A to the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "220. The High Court Division further held as  follows:— <br> ......... As Judges, our only tools are the Constitution, the laws made or adopted under it and the facts presented before us. We are bound by these instruments and we are to follow it. The plea of State necessity shall have to be con- sidered within the bounds of these instruments and not without those. That is how we read Grotius and Lord Pearce in Madzimbamuto. But Grotius or Lord Mansfield in Stration’s case (1779) or Lord Pearce, did not dream of break- ing any law or giving legitimacy to an illegality, far less making the Constitution, the supreme law of any country, subservient to the com- mands of any Army General, whose only source of power is through the muzzle of a gun although all the Generals in any country seize power in the name of the people and on the plea of lack of democracy in the country with a solemn promise to restore it in no time, as if the  -democracy can be handed down to the people in a well packed multi-coloured gift box. <br> Democracy is a way of life. It cannot be begotten over-night, It cannot be handed down in a silver platter. It has to be earned. It has to be owned. The world history is replete with stories of people, ordinary people who fought for their rights in different names in different countries,  but the cry for liberty, the cry for equality, the cry for fraternity were reverberated in the same manner from horizon to horizon. This sense of liberty made us independent from the yoke of the British rule in 1947 and the same sense of liberty pushed us through the war of liberation in 1971 and brought Bangladesh into existence. But the proclamation of Martial Law is alto- gether the negation of the said spirit of liberty and independence. In this connection we would recall what was said in the case of Shamima Sultana Seema vs Government of Bangladesh 2LG (2005) 194 at para-123: <br> _ “It should be remembered that the ingrained spirit of the Constitution is its intrinsic power. It is its soul. The Constitu- tion of a country is its source of power. It is invaluable with its such soul. It strives a nation to move forward. But if the said spirit is lost, the Constitution becomes a mere stale and hollow instrument without its such life and force. It becomes a dead letter. The United Kingdom, although does not have any written Constitution but has got the spirit of the Constitution and that is why the people of that country can feel proud of their democracy but there are countries with Constitutions, written and amended many a times but without the said spirit, the democracy remains a mirage™.  ",
      "219. Then regarding the case of Nusrat Bhutto, on which the petitioners relied in which Pakistan Supreme Court did not follow Asma Jilanis case and gave approve to the imposition of Martial Law invoking doctrine of necessity, the High Court Division held as follows:               “It appears, that the Supreme Court of Pakistan accepted the explanation piven by General Mohammad Ziaul Haq for the Army’s intervention and validated such intervention and the imposition of Martial Law invoking the doc- trine of State necessity. In doing so the learned Judges resorted to the Holy Quran also, in justi- fication for suspension of the Constitution and dissolution of the National and Provincial Assemblies. In this respect they were satisfied  with the explanations given by the Army Chief  of Staff. This was a U-turn of the Supreme Court from its carlier stand in the cascs of Asma  Jilani and Ziaur Rahman.”  ",
      "218. This is how the doctrine of necessity made its appearance in order to salvage what was left of the normal constitutional process in Pakistan at that time in 1955. <br> The High Court Division further held as fol- lows: <br> In the case of Asma Jilani vs Government of Punjab PLD 1972 SC 139, Hamoodur Rahman, CJ, held at page-204-5: <br> “Reverting now to question of the legality of the Presidential Order No.3 of 1969 and the Martial Law Regulation No.78 of 1971 it fol- lows from the reasons given carlier that they were both made by an incompetent authority and, therefore; lacked the attribute of legitimacy which is one of the essential characteristics of a valid law. The Presidential Order No.3 of 1969 was also invalid on two additional grounds, namely, that it was a Presidential Order, which could not in terms of the Provisional Constitu- tion Order itself amend the Constitution so as to take away the jurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts under Article 98 and that it certain- ly could not, in any event, take away the judicial power of the Courts to hear and determine ques- tions pertaining even to their own jurisdiction and this power could not be vested in another authority as long as the Courts continued to exist. <br> This does not, however, dispose of the case, for, we are again presented by the learned Attorney-General with the argument that a greater chaos might result by the acceptance of this principle of legitimacy. He has reminded the Court of the grave conse- quences that followed when in Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan's case a similar argument was spurned by the Federal Court and disas- ter brought in. I am not unmindful of the grave responsibility that rests upon Courts not to do anything which might make confu- sion worse confounded or create a grealer state of chaos if that can possibly be avoided consistently with their duty to decide in accordance with law. ......... This is a diffi- cult question to decide and although I have for my guidance the example of our own Federal Court, which in Governor-General s Reference No.1 of 1955 invoked the maxim of salus populi suprema lex to create some kind of an order out of chaos. [ would like to proceed with great caution, for, 1 find it diffi- cult to legitimize what I am convinced is ille- gitimate.....” <br> ------------------------------------------------------------ <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> Then in the above case€ the Hon'ble Chief Justice fell back on the doctrine of necessity and held at page-206-7 the contents of which we have already stated earlier,  ",
      "217. But in this connection, the opinion of De Smith is pertinent: <br> “It is clear ... that the leading Pakistan decision in 1955 was a not very well disguised act of political judgment. By the normal canons of construction, what the Governor-General had done was null and void. But the judges steered between Scylla and Charybdis and chose what seemed to them to be the least of evils. Quoted from Leslie Wolf-Phillips: Constitutional Legitimacy at page- 11)\".  ",
      "216. His Lordship further held at page-396: <br> “This Court held in Mr Tamizuddin Khan's case that the Constituent Assembly was not a sovereign body. But that did not mean that if the Assembly was not a sovereign body the Govemor-General was”.  ",
      "215. It should be noted that earlier to the Governor-Generals Reference No.l, in the case of Usif Patel vs Crown PLD 1955 FC 387, decided on April 12, 1955, on behalf of an unanimous Supreme  Court, Munir CJ held at page -392: <br> “The rule hardly requires any explanation, much less emphasis, that a Legislature cannot validate an invalid law if it does not possess the power to legislate on the subject to which the invalid law relates, the principle governing val- idation being that validation being itself legisla- tion you cannot validate what you cannot legis- late upon. Therefore if the Federal Legislature, in the absence of a provision expressly author- izing it to do so, was incompetent to amend the Indian Independence Act or the Government of India Act, the Governor-General possessing no larger powers than those of the Federal Legis- lature was equally incompetent to amend either of those Acts by an Ordinance. Under the Independence Act the authority competent {0 legislate on constitutional matters being the Constituent Assembly, it is that Assembly alone which can amend those Acts. The learned Advocate-General alleges that the Constituent Assembly has been dissolved and that therefore validating powers cannot be exercised by that Assembly. In Mr Tamizuddin Khan's case, we¢ did not consider it necessary to decide the ques- tion whether the Constituent Assembly was lawfully dissolved but assuming that it was, the effect of the dissolution can certainly not be the transfer of its powers to the Governor-General. The Governor-General can give or withhold his assent to the legislation of the Constituent Assembly but he himself is not the Constituent Assembly and on its disappearance he can nei- ther claim powers, which he never possessed. nor claim to succeed to the powers of that  Assembly.”                ",
      "214. However, Comelius, J in Tamizuddin Khan's case dissented and at page— 358 held as fol- lows: <br> “J place the Constituent Assembly above the Governor-General, the chief Executive of the State, for two reasons, firstly that the Constituent Assembly was a sovereign body, and secondly because the statutes under and in accordance with which the Governor-General was required to function, were within the competence of the Constituent Assembly to amend....\"”  ",
      "213. It appears that the Hon’ble Chief Justice was more concerned and worried about the difficul- ties of the Governor-General who was supposed to be only a titular head, than the Constituent Assembly, the institution which represented the peo- ple of Pakistan but was dissolved by the Governor- General which augmented the constitutional crisis. With great respect, it appears that the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan held a double standard in pro- tecting the interest of the Govemor-General than that of the Constituent Assembly. He refused to  invoke the doctrine of necessity but upheld the dis- solution of the Constituent Assembly which by then was ready with the Constitution for Pakistan but invoked the said very doctrine in aid of the Govemnor-General to steer him clear out of the con- stitutional crisis, created by himself, by twisting and bending the legal provisions even calling upon the  seven hundred years old maxims.  ",
      "212. In that case the above Chief Justic;: held at page. 299: <br> ~ “It has been suggested by the leaned Judges of the Sind Chief Court and has also been vehemently urged before us that if the view that I take on the question of assent be cor- rect, the result would be disastrous because the entire legislation passed by the Constituent Assembly, and the acts done and orders passed under it will in that case have to be held to be void, R [ am quite clear in my mind that we are not concerned with the consequences, however beneficial or disastrous they may be, if the undoubted legal position was that all legis- lation by the Legislature of the Dominion under section (3) of section 3 needed the assent of the Governor-General. If the result is disaster, it will merely be another instance of how thought- lessly the Constituent Assembly proceeded with its business and by assuming for itself the posi- tion of an irremovable Legislature fo' what straits it has brought the country. Unless any                rule of estoppel require us to pronounce merely purported legislation as complete and valid leg- islation, we have no option but to pronounce it to be void and to leave it to the relevant author- ities under the Constitution or to the country {0 set right the position in any way it may be open to them. The question raised involves the rights of every citizen in Pakistan, and neither any rule of construction nor any rule estoppel stands in the way of a clear pronouncement.” <br> This stoic and stout stand like that of a 16th Century Common Law Judge was taken by Munir, CJ, when the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly was challenged but the same Chief Justice became full of equity when the Governor- General was caught in his own game because of his earlier dissolution of the Constituent Assembly.  ",
      "211.  This doctrine of State necessity was pos- sibly applied for the first time in this sub-continent in Pakistan in the Reference by His Excellency the Governor-General in Special Reference No.l of 1955 [PLD 1955 FC 435 = 7 DLR (FC) 395]. This Reference was made under section 213 of the Government of India Act, 1935 . It shows how Ghulam Muhammad, the Governor-General of pakistan was caught in his own palace clique but was rescued by an over-anxious Supreme Court by reincarnating a long forgotten doctrine of State necessity. The Hon’ble Chief Justice looked for help in the 13th century Brocton digged deep into the early Middle Ages for Kings prerogatives and the maxims, such as, Id Quod Alias Non Est Licitum, Necessitas Licitum Facit (that which otherwise is not lawful, necessity makes lawful), salus populi Suprema lex (safety of the people is the supreme Jaw) and salus republicae est suprema lex (safety of the State is the supreme law). His Lordship referred to Chitty’ s exposition and Maitland’s dis- cussion on the Monarchy in England in late 17th century. His Lordship thereafter referred to the summing up of Lord Mansfield, to the Jury in the proceedings against George Stratton and then held at pages 485-6: <br> “The principle clearly emerging from this address of Lord Mansfield is that subject to the condition of absoluteness, extremeness and imminence, an act which would otherwise be illegal becomes legal if it is bone bona fide under the stress of necessity, the necessity being referable to an intention to preserve the consti- tution, the State or the Society and to prevent it from dissolution, and affirms Chittyfs statement that necessity knows no law and the maxim cited by Bracton that necessity makes lawful which otherwise is not lawful....... the indis- pensable condition being that the exercise of that power is always subject to the legislative authority of parliament, to be exercised ex post facto....... The emergency legislative power, however, cannot extend to matters which are not the product of the necessity, as for instance, changes in the constitution which are not dircct- ly referable to the emergency.” <br> But what the Hon'ble Chief Justice decided to ignore was that the Governor-General himself brought disaster upon the entire country by dissolv- ing the Constituent Assembly ecarlier in October 1954 when the Prime Minister had already set the date for adopting the Constitution for Pakistan in December, 1954 . That itself was a violation of the Independence Act, 1947 and a treasonous act against the people of Pakistan. With great respect, the Governor-General ought not to have allowed to take advantage of his own grievous wrong against Pakistan. As a matter of fact, that was the beginning of the end. Besides, the Hon’ble Chief Justice also forgot that only a few months back in the case of Federation of Pakistan vs Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan PLD 1955 FC 240 =7 DLR (FC) 291, his Lordship refused to interfere even in case of a real disaster brought about, again by the Governor-General in dissolving the Constituent Assembly.  ",
      "210. This doctrine of State necessity is no magic wand. It does not make an illegal act a legal one. But the Court in exceptional circumstances, in order to avert the resultant evil of illegal legisla- tions, may condone such illegality on the greater interest of the community in general but on condi- tion that those acts could have been legally done at least by the proper authority.                ",
      "209. The moral is, no premium can be given to any body for violation of the Constitution for any rea- son and for any consideration. What is illegal and wrong must always be condemned as illegal and wrong till eternity. In the present context, the illegality and gravest wrong was committed against the People Republic of Bangladesh and its people as a whole.  ",
      "208. If we hark back to history, we would see that after Restoration in 1660, Charles II became King of England with effect from January 1649, the day when his father, Charles I was beheaded, in order to keep the lawful continuity of the Realm but not the continuity of the illegal administration of the  Commonwealth.  ",
      "207. The High Court Division then regarding fhe doctrine of necessity-and condonation expressed its view as follows:— <br>  .......................................................... <br> .................................................... <br> “But in order to avoid confusion, legal or otherwise and also to keep continuity of the sovereignty and legal norm of the Republic, we have next to consider as to whether the legisla- tive acts purported to be done by those illegal and void Proclamations etc. during the period from August 15, 1975 to April 9, 1979, can be condoned, by invoking the doctrine of “ State  necessity” <br> But it does not mean that for the sake of conti- nuity of the sovereignty of the State, the Constitution has to be soiled with illegalities, rather, the perpetrators of such illegalities should be suit- ably punished and condemned so that in future no adventurist, no usurper, would have the audacity to defy the people, their Constitution, their Government, established by them with their con- sent.  ",
      "206. However, the High Court Division found that item (2) as referred above, on conversion, means that any act or legislative measure, which is not in accordance with or could not have been made under the Constitution, cannot be held valid by applying the doctrine of necessity and that Hamoodur Rahman CJ was speaking at a time when Pakistan was far away from accepting the doctrine of basic structure and therefore he could speak of condoning legislative actions which, at that time, the National Assembly had the competence to pass. Pakistan Supreme Court, towards the end of the twentieth century, leaned towards the doctrine of basic structure and the doctrine of basic structure was accepted as late in the year 2000 in the case of Zafar Ali Shah (Supra).  ",
      "205. Regarding doctrine of necessity and con- donation in Asma Jilani’s case Hamoodur Rahman  CJ held as follows: <br> “I too am of the opinion that recourse has to be taken to the doctrine of necessary where the ignoring of it would result in disastrous conse- quences to the body politic and upset the social order itself but I respectfully beg to disagree with the view that this is a doctrine for validat- ing the illegal acts of usurpers. In my }}umble opinion this doctrine can be involved in aid only after the Court has come to the conclusion that the acts of the usurpers were illegal and illegiti- mate. It is only then the question arises as to how many of his acts legislative or otherwise                should be condoned or maintained notwith- standing their illegality in the wider public interest. 1 would call this a principle of condo- nation and not legitimization. Applying this test I would condone (1) all transactions which are past and closed for no useful purposc can be served by reopening them (2) all acts and leg- islative measures which are in accordance with or could have been made under the abrogated constitution or the previous legal order (3) all acts which tend to advance or promote the good of the people (4) all acts required to be done for the ordinary orderly running of the State and all such measures as would establish or lead to establishment of in our case the objectives men- tioned in the Objectives Resolution of 1954 . I would not however condone any act intended to entrench the usurper more firmly in his power or to directly help him to run the country con- trary to the legitimate objectives. 1 would not condone anything which seriously impairs the rights of the citizens except in so far as they may be designed to advance the social welfare  and national solidarity”.  ",
      "204. But since there are limits to the applica- tion of such doctrine of necessity, in occasions, the Parliament to come out of this position, resorted to the private law contrivance of ratification of unau- thorized actions of agents by principals. But there is an inherent limitation even in respect of such ratifi- cation as life cannot be given to a prohibited trans- action by ratification. Again by the device of ratifi- cation the Parliament or any authority cannot increase its authority. It can ratify only those actions of others, which it can lawfully do. Thus parliament cannot, by resorting to the device of ratification, rat- ify and render valid an amendment, which, itself, cannot do because the same will lead to the infringe- ment of the basic features of the Constitution.  ",
      "203. As it appears that this doctrine of necessi- ty is applied to condone some of the actions of an usurper, but not all. In Madzimbamutu vs Lardner Burke (1968) 3 All ER 561, 579 Lord Pearce, in his dissenting judgment, termed the doctrine of condo- nation as doctrine of implicd mandate and observed:—  <br>  “l' accept the existence of the principle that act done by those actually in control withoy lawful validity may be recognized as valid or acted on by the courts, with certain limitations namely, (a) so far as they are directed to and rea: sonably required for ordinary running of the State; and (b) so far as they do not impair the rights of citizens under the lawful (1961) Cons- titution; and (c) so far as they are not intended to and do not in fact directly help the usurpation and do not run contrary to the policy of the law- ful sovereign. This is tantamount to a test of public policy.”  ",
      "202. Since we have declared that Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations and Orders etc., are ille- gal, void and non east and the Fifth Amendment is also ultra vires the Constitution question will arise as to whether to prevent chaos and confusion and to avoid anomaly and to preserve continuity, the actions and the legislative measures taken during Martial Law period needs to be condoned / cured by the principles of doctrine of necessity.  ",
      "201. As such we hold that the Fifth Amend- ment is also illegal and void and the High Court Division rightly declared the same as repugnant, illegal and witra vires the Constitution.  ",
      "200. Moreover, the Fifth Amendment ratifying and validating the Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations and Orders not only violated the supremacy of the Constitution but also the rule of law and by preventing judicial review of the legisla- tive and administrative actions, also violated two other more basic features of the Constitution, name- ly, independence of judiciary and its power of judi- cial review.  ",
      "199. Accordingly we hold that since the Constitution is the Supreme law of the land and the Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations and Orders  romulgated/made by the usurpers, being illegal, void and non-est in the eye of law, could not be rat- ified or confirmed by the Second Parliament by the Fifth Amendment, as it itself had no such power to enact such laws as made by the above Proclama- tions, Martial Law Regulation or orders.  ",
      "198. The footprints that the “period of delin- quency” leaves behind are Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations and Orders in the form of black laws and the ultimate insult to “We, the people” is the attempt to ratify these black laws by bringing those into the umbrella of the Constitution itself. In the present case the High Court Division recognizing these footprints sought to erase those once for all and since all the parties before the High Court Division agreed that the Constitution is supreme, obvious the result is that Martial Law is illegal and unconstitutional. So this Court.should not, indeed cannot, grant leave in these petitions because to do so would be perceived by “the people of Bangladesh” in the way that our highest judiciary is still unable, long after the *“period of delinquen- cy”, to properly and adequately deal with such delinquency and further, it would send wrong sig- nals to those who wish to circumvent the “will of the people” in the Constitution and that each of our gen- erations must also be taught, educated and informed about those dark days; the easiest way of doing this               is to recognize our errors of the pz?st and reflect these sentiments in the. judgments of this Court which will ensure preservation of the sovereignty of “We, the Pwp]e of Bangladesh™ forever as a true “pole star”,  ",
      "197. As it appears our country entered its “period of delinquency” at its very early Part in 1975 and that delinquency continued for long 16 years, Martial Law fall in the category of “black Jaw” and the treatment of Martial Law by the Court, was  mostly based on Dosso's case (supra). Accordingly the ghost of Dosso’s case should be given a go bye from our jurisprudence forever so that no one can ever again even think about overrid- ing “the will of the people” of Bangladesh and all must also ensure that this history never repeats and all must recognize these faults of the past and must rectify them so that our conscience remains clear.  ",
      "195. Further, the Parliament though may amend the Constitution under Article 142 but cannot make the Constitution subservient to any other Proclamations etc, or cannot disgrace it in any man- ner since the Constitution is the embodiment and solemn expression of the will of the people of Bangladesh, attained through the supreme sacrifice of nearly three million martyrs., Further the Parliament, by amendment of the Constitution can- not legitimize any illegitimate activity.  196'. Accordingly, keeping the Constitution in suspension and/or making amendments therein by any authority not mentioned in the Constitution oth- erwise than in accordance with the procedure pre- scribed in the Constitution itself, is tantamount to mutilating, and/or subverting the Constitution. The Parliament cannot ratify and validate those uncon- stitutional acts of usurpers as the Parliament is not  supreme over everything else like the Parliament of  the United Kingdom, rather it is independent of other organs of the State, but it certainly operates within certain parameters under the Constitution.  ",
      "194. In the cases of AT Mridha and Anwar Hossain this Division held that there is no existence of Martial Law or the Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations or Orders in our Constitution or any of the laws of the land. Those authorities or the Proclamation etc. are quite foreign to our jurispru- dence. Still those Proclamations etc. were imposed on the people of Bangladesh. Those have got no Jegal basis. Those are illegal and imposed by force. The people are constrained to accept it for the time being, not out of attraction or its legality but out of  fear.  ",
      "193. It may be mentioned here that the power to amend the Constitution is an ONErous task assigned to the Parliament, which represents the will  of the people through their chosen representatives. It is to be carried out in accordance with the procedure  prescribed in Article 142 of the Constitution and by no other means, in no other manncr and by no one else. Suspending the Constitution in the first place, and then making amendments in it by one man by the stroke of his pen, that is to say in a manner not envisaged or permitted by the Constitution, are mutilation and/or subversion of the Constitution simpliciter and no sanctity is attached to such amendments per se. Indeed, the Constitution is an  organic whole and a living document meant for all  times to come.  ",
      "192. According to the spirit of the Preamble and also Article 7 of the Constitution the military rule, direct or indirect, is to be shunned once for all. Let it be made clear that military rule was wrongly justified in the past and it ought not to be justified in future on any ground, principle, doctrine or theory whatsoever, Military rule is against the dignity, hon- our and glory of the nation that it achieved after great sacrifice; it is against the dignity and honor of the people of Bangladesh who are committed 10 uphold the sovereignty and integrity of the nation by all means; it is also against the honour of each and every soldier of the Armed Forces who are oath bound to bear true faith and allegiance to Bangla- desh and uphold the constitution, which embodies the will of the people, honestly and faithfully serve Bangladesh in their respective services and also see that the Constitution is upheld, it is not kept in sus- pension or abrogated, it is not subverted, it is not mutilated, and to say. the: least it is not held in                abeyance and it is not amended by an authority not competent to do so under the Constitution.  ",
      "191. Further as we have already stated while dealing with the principle of the supremacy of the Constitution, the will of the people does not con- template Martial Law or any other laws not made in accordance with the Constitution. The armed forces are also subject to the will of the people and their oaths as provided in section 15(2) of the Army Act 1952, section 17(2) of the Air Force Act 1953 and section 14 of the Navy Ordinance 1961, make it plain. They serve the “people” and can never  become the masters of the “people’”, Accordingly:  Martial Law is unconstitutional and illigal and it is a mischievous device not founded in any law known in Bangladesh and by Martial law the whole nation Whole nation is hijacked by some people with the support of the armed forces and the whole nation goes into a state of siege; it is like that the whole nation and “we, the people of Bangladesh”, are taken hostage and fur- ther like a hostage-taking situation, the hostage ti- ers themselves recognize that there is 2 superior law than their weapons which “Ve, the people” put in their hands to serve us and they recognize that there are two impediments to their taking over power of assuming power, first, the Constitution itself and so they, at first, start by saying “Notwithstanding any- thing in the Constitution” because they recognize that the Constitution is superior but they choose 10 brush it aside, The second impediment to Martial Law is the Superior Court of the Republic entrusted with the solemn duty to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution” and so every Martial Law, immediately upon Proclamation seeks to curb the powers of the Court, particularly, the powers of the Constitutional Court.  ",
      "190. The High Court Division after consider- ing all the aspects concluded as follows:— <br> “There is no existence of Martial Law Authorities or Martial Law Proclamations, Regulations or Order in our Constitution or any of the laws of the land. Those authorities or proclamations are quite foreign to our jurispru- dence. Still those proclamations etc were imposed on the people of Bangladesh. Those have got no legal basis. Those are illegal and imposed by force. The people are constrained to accept it for the time being, not out of attraction to its legality but out of fear. As such it has no  legal acceptance. ....... <br>  “In the instant case, the solemn Constitu- tion of Bangladesh were freely changed by the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs, issued by the self-appointed or nominated Presidents and CMLAs, in their whims and caprices. The learned Additional Attorney-General although did not support Justice Sayem but half —heart- edly attempted to justify the actions taken by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed and Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc. but when we specifically asked him to show us any Constitutional or legal provision in justification of the seizure of State—Power of the Republic , he was without any answer although he mum- bled from time to time about the Fourth Amendment”, <br> “The election of the Second Parliament was conducted in February, 1979, during Martial Law. At that time, Lieutenant General Ziaur Rahman, BU, psc, was the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator.                 The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, was passed on April 6, 1979, lepalizing oll the Proclamationt, Martial Law Regulations, Martial Law Orders and the actions taken there-  on, some of which are mentioned above <br> Any common man of ordinary prudence would say that the enormity of illegality sought to be lepalized by this Act, would have shocked the Chief Justice Coke so much so that it would have left him dumb instead of saying that ‘when an Act of Parliament is against right and reason, or repugnant ... sosvrne ...the common law will control it and adjudge that Act to be void’, Perhaps, it would also leave the Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, out of his comprehension, if he would found that ‘after a formal written Constitution has been lawfully adopted by a competent body and has been generally accept- ed by the people including the judiciary as the Constitution of the country’, an army com- mander can have the audacity to change the Constitution beyond recognition and transfigur- ing a secular Bangladesh into a theocratic State. Perhaps the US Supreme Court would have kept mum instead of holding that the guarantec of due process bars Congress from enactments that ‘shock the sense of fair play’. <br> But what duty is cast upon us. It is ordained that we must not and appreciate the facts and the law in its proper perspective. <br> We have done so. We must hold and declare that this Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979, is not law”.  ",
      "189. The High Court Division answered the above submission as follows: <br> “We have given our utmost consideration to the above submission of Mr Akhtar Imam but found no substance. Rather we must acknowl- edge that we no longer live in the era of Henry VIII, Lois XIV or even Napoleon Bonaparte, whose words were law. But we live in the 21st century, Now the voice of the people, however feeble, is the first as well as the last word, Their will is the supreme law. The Constitution guar- antees it, 5o also the Court and every body must follow this principle without any exception, in this Twenty First Century”.  ",
      "188. The High Court Division also narrated the submission of the learned Counsel of the profor- ma respondent No.5 which is as follows: <br> “Mr Akhtar Imam, Advocate, however, in support of Martial Law, contended that in our country a Martial Law culture or Martial Law  jurisprudence has been evolved. He based his argument partly on the book ‘Bangladesh Constitution: Trends And Issues’ by Justice Mustafa Kamal. The learned Advocate, read extensively from the said book and argued that whether we like it or not we can neither avoid nor overlook the long shadows of Marshals. They are there and it is better to acknowledge them.”  ",
      "187. From the analysis of Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs and the findings of our Apex Court as stated above, it is crystal clear that the Constitution was made subordinate and subservient to the Proclamations dated August 20, 1975, November 8, 1975 and November 29, 1976 and the Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders made there under and as such those are w/tra vires the Constitution. There is no provision in the Constitution, which is ‘Supra Constitutional’, or to put it mildly, ‘Extra Constitutional’. All laws or pro- visions and actions taken thereon must, without any exception, conform to the.Constitution. Any law or provision, which is beyond the ambit of the Constitution, is w/tra vires and void and as such non- est in the eye of law. The doubtless supremacy of the Constitution is far above all institutions, functionar- ies and services it created.  ",
      "186. We have already discussed as to how our Constitution is supreme and under the Constitution all the powers and functions of the Republic are vested in the three organs of the Government, name- ly, Legislature, Executive and Judiciary and since all these organs owe their existence to the Constitution,                which is the embodiment of the will of the people as held by the superior Courts, the basic features of the Constitution cannot be changed by Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations or Orders.  ",
      "185. The High Court Division regarding the changes made by the above Proclamations dated August 20, 1975, November 8, 1975, and November 25,1976 concluded as follows:— <br> “(i) These changes were made by a nominat- ed President and CMLA-who had no leg- islative power either to make a law or abrogate any, not to speak of any of the provision of the Constitution but it was done. <br>   (ii)  Votes of not less than two-thirds of the total number of members of Parliament is required to amend a provision of the Constitution. No Parliament was in exis- tence, on the said date on April 23, 1977, but without following the above noted procedure, as stipulated in Article 142, the changes in various provisions of the Constitution were made by the above noted Proclamation Order. <br> (iii) The above noted insertion and substitu- tion of provisions, among others, made in the Constitution, changed its basic char- acter, as such, could not even be done by the two-thirds of the total number of members of the Parliament. <br> (iv) The Constitution was made subservient to the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs. <br> This is no amendment of the Constitution even in the plain eyes, but destruction of the basic character of the Constitution by a Proclamation Order issued by the CMLA. But the Second Parliament ratified and validated the said Proclamation. Order No.1 of 1977 by the Fifth Amendment. Not only the Proclamations but also Martial Law Regulations and Martial Law Order made under the various Proclama- tions, were also ratified and validated. <br> Under the above noted Proclamations, a couple of hundred MLRs and MLOs were made from time to time to suit the needs of the usurpers, since the promulgation of the Martial Law on August 20, 1975, till it was withdrawn on April 7, 1979 . All those MLRs and MLOs were also ratified and validated by the Fifth Amendment, passed on April 6, 1979™.  ",
      "184. Regarding the other point as to whether Fifth Amendment negates the Constitution and repugnant to the basic feature of the Constitution, it was argued before the High Court Division that the provisions for amendment of the Constitution is pro- vided for in Article 142 and amendment can be done only in the manner provided therein and since the Fifth Amendment validating all illegal acts of the usurpers under the cover of Martial Law, not only changed the basic structure as well as the character of the Constitution in its totality but rather uprooted the Constitution and as such, in the eye of law, it was no amendment but destruction of the Constitution altogether. As such Fifth Amendment is wlira vires  the Constitution. The High Court Division held as follows: <br> “Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU being appointed as the Chief of Army Staff on the August 22, 1975, by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, was still in the active service in the Republic of Bangladesh, when he entered the office of the President. It should be noted that by virtue of his office as President, the Supreme Command of the defence services, of Bangla- desh was vested in him but at the same time he was a servant of the Republic as the Chief of Army Staff”. <br> It should also be noted that in pursuance to the Order dated April 21, 1977, Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU must have taken the follow- ing oath before entering the office of President: <br> The English text is :<br>  “1 .The President.-An oath (or affirmation) in the following form shall be administered by the Chief Justice. (after amendment by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed by his Proclama- tion dated August 20, 1975):               \"I, ....., do solemnly swear(or affirm) that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of President of  Bangladesh according to law :  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to Bangladesh:<br>  That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution: <br> And that 1 will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill will. ......<br>  But only 2(two) days later, on April 23, 1977, by the Proclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamation Order No.1 of 1977) (Annexure-L-1), extensive changes by way of amendment was made which not only changed   the Constitution but defaced it beyond recogniton. <br> Besides, Paragraph 3A was inserted after Paragraph 3 in the Fourth Schedule to the Cons- fitution to validate the transitional and tempo- rary provisions made since the declaration of independence on March 26, 1971 till 16th December, 1972, when the Constitution became effective. But this paragraph 3A was added to validate all the proclamations made since August 20, 1975 with amendments and all other acts, actions, MLRs and MLOs and proceedings taken there under till the date when the Martial Law would be withdrawn.  ",
      "183. Even the Supreme Court did not relent in that horrendous situation when the battles were fought everywhere but upheld the Constitution. In the case of Ex Parte Milligan (1866), Justice Davis, in delivering its opinion of the Court held:— <br> “This nation, as experience has proved,  cannot always remain at peace, and has no right to expect that it will always have wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached to the princi- ples of the Constitution. wicked men, ambitious of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln; and if this right is con- ceded, and the calamities of war again befall us, the dangers to human liberty are frightful to contemplate. If our fathers had failed to provide for just such a contingency, they would have been false to the trust reposed in them. They knewothe history of the world told theméthe nation they were founding, be its existence short or long, would be involved in war; how often or how long continued, human foresight could not tell; and that unlimited power, wherever lodged at such a time, was especially hazardous to freemen. For this, and other equally weighty reasons, they secured the inheritance they had, fought to maintain, and by incorporating in a written constitution the safeguards which time had proved were essential to its preservation. Not one of these safeguards can the President, or Congress, or the Judiciary disturb, except the one concerning the writ of habeas corpus. <br> .................................................... <br> ...... Knowing this, they limited the suspension to one great right, and left the rest to remain for- ever inviolable. But, it is insisted that the safety of the country in time of war demands that this broad claim for martial law shall be sustained. If this were true, it could be well said that a coun- try, preserved at the sacrifice of all the cardinal principles of liberty, is not worth the cost of preservation. Happily, it is not so0.”............ (Quoted from Professor John P Frank on ; Cases And Materials on Constitutional Law (1952 Revision) at page 263-64) .  ",
      "182. Regarding this the High Court Division observed as follows: <br> If we look back to the history we would find that the Civil War of 1861 in the United States threatened its very existence as onc nation. It engulfed the entire country. War we'nl on in almost everywhere in the country with bleak prospect for survival of the States as unit- ed with their Constitution. Nobody could blame the President of the United States or others in that precarious and catastrophic situation if the Constitution of the country was pushed to the back-seat due to the said extreme emergency but even in that critical situation the citizens of the North upheld the high ideals of democratic principles and did not at all compromise and give in to the inhuman demands of the Souther- ners, for allowing slavery in the country in vio- lation of the principles of liberty and equality, as enshrined in the Constitution, rather, they held the Constitution high above everything and fought with their lives to free the slaves in vin- dication of the rights guaranteed under the Constitution. <br> Although there was serious controversy all over the country on the issue of slavery but even in such a trying moment, no proclamation declaring Martial Law was made. Instead. their lawfully elected President gave this message to the Congress on July 4, 1861, on the outbreak of the Civil War: <br> “It presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy-a government of the people by the same peoplecan or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes. It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to organic law in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this case or any other pretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence, break up their government and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth, It forces us to ask: ‘Is there, in all republics, this inherent and fatal weakness ? Must a gov- ernment, of necessity, be too strong for the lib- erties of its own people, or too weak to main- tain its own existence?” (Quoted from KC Wheare: Modern Constitutions, Second Edition, 1966, page-142).                 ",
      "181. Inthis regard it may be noted that in erst- while Pakistan, at first, Martial Law was imposed on October 7, 1958 by Iskander Mirza, the then                president, and thereafler on March 26, 1969 Martial Law was imposed by General Yahya Khan and in both occasion some pretexts were raised for declar- ing Martial Laws. But while imposing Martial Law on August 15, 1975 and also while issuing the proclamation dated August 20, 1975 Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed did not raise any such pretext. While discussing the Proclamation dated April 6, 1979 we have already stated that on August 15, 1975 the Parliament was very much in existence and Vice-President was also available. Accordingly in view of the killing of the then President, the consti- tutional machinery should have automatically come into effect and the Vice President should have taken over as Acting President until fresh election was held for the choice of a successor. The political machinery would then have moved according to the Constitution and the Parliament could have taken steps to resolve the crisis if Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed had not, by Proclamation dated August 20, 1975, suspended the provision of Article 48 of the Constitution so far it related to the election of the President and likewise Justice ASM Sayem, to whom Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed allegedly handed over the power of the President, had not dis- solved the Parliament by Proclamation dated November 8, 1975 . Accordingly Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem and subsequently Major General Ziaur Rahman, to whom Justice Abusadat Mohammad Sayem handed over the Office of the President/ Chief Martial Law Administrators in unconstitution- al way, also did not allow the constitutional machin- ery to come into effect and on usurping the power of the Government started issuing all kinds of Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations and Orders.  ",
      "180. Next question is whether the situation as itexisted on August 15, 1975 necessitated the impo- sition of Martial Law.  ",
      "977. During this time, a huge number of MLRs and MLOs were issued. Besides, various provi- sions of the Constitution were amended from time to time by amendment of the Second Proclamation.  On our query as to how and under what law Justice Sayem, the Chief Justice of                 Bangladesh, could take over as the President of Bangladesh and also assumed the powers of CMLA, the learned Additional Attomey- General was without any answer, <br> We ourselves tried to probe but could not find any. The Constitution or any other law did not provide so. Besides, the concept of Martial Law is totally absent in our Constitution or in any other law or jurispru- dence. The Constitution, the supreme law of the country, does not provide it nor any other law of our country. There is no place or office of CMLA in our jurisprudence. Obviously, the then Chicef Justice of Bangladesh, com- pletely ignored these legal realities for rea- sons best known to him but for that reason his taking over as the President of Bangladesh and assumption of the powers of CMLA would not become legal. Even a Chief Justice is not above the law <br> As such, he was a usurper to the office of President of Bangladesh and his assump- tion of the powers of CMLA, a legally non- existent office, was void and non-est in the eye of Jaw. Consequently, all his subsequent actions taken by way of amendment of the Proclamation dated November 8, 1975 MLRs, MLOs and Ordinance, issued from time to time being beyond the ambit of the Constitution, were also all illegal, void ab initio and non est, <br> In due course, Justice Sayem by the Third Proclamation, handed over the office of Martial Law Administrator 1o Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU, 10 act as the CMLA., <br> Subsequently, Justice Sayem nomi- nated Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU 1o be the President of Bangladesh and also handed over the office of President (o him, <br> From the Order dated April 21, 1977, we could learn that Justice Sayem became  President of Bangladesh on being nominated by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed. Justice Sayem similarly nominated Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU as the next President of Bangladesh. <br> The office of President has been cre- ated by Article 48 of the Constitution. The qualification and election to the office of President has been stipulated in the said pro- vision. But there is no provision for nomina- tion to the office of President in the entire Constitution. From the language of the Order dated April 21, 1977, it appears that this pro- vision of nomination was added by clause (aa) to the First Proclamation by subsequent amendment. <br> It is amazing that when even a chair- man of a Union Council has to be elected and cannot be nominated, nomination could be made to the highest office of the Republic and even that was done by a Proclamation. This is a disgrace and insult to the Nation- hood of Bangladesh. But this insult was rati- fied by the Second Parliament in the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act. <br> We have already stated above that a proclamation is not a law and by proclama- tion neither a law can be made nor a law can be abrogated not to speak of the provisions of the Constitution. As such, the First Proclamation along with clause aa is non-est in the eye of law and the nominations of both Justice. Sayem and Major General Ziaur Rahman as President were in total violation ol the Constitution, without Jurisdiction and without lawful authority™,  ",
      "179. Regarding the legality of the Proclama- tions dated August 20, 1975, November 8, 1975 and November 29, 1973, the High Court Division stated  as follows : <br> “During ancient times proclamations were a source of law in England. King Henry the VIII (1509-1547) used to assert his power to make laws by way of proclamations. By the Statute of 1539, the King could legislate by Proclamations without Parliament. This Act was, however, repealed during the reign of Edward VI (1547-1553). Still Mary I (1553-1558) and Eli- zabeth 1 (1558-1603) used proclamations, but much less frequently than their father.  In those ancient days the Monarchs used to rule by divine right but by 17th century it was estzblished that the source of the Regal power was the common law of the land.  King James | asked Sir Edward Coke, Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, his opinion about the right of the Kings to issue proclama- tions. To his such query, Chief Justice Coke, Chief Justice Fleming, Chief Baron Tanfield and Baron Altham delivered their opinion thus; <br> “The King cannot create any offence which was not an offence before, for then he may alter the law of the land in his procla- mation in some high point.... The Jaw of England is divided into three parts: the com- mon law, statute law, and custom; but the King’s proclamation is none of these.....The King has no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows him.” (Reported in 2 State Tr 726, Quoted from Halsbury’s Laws  of England, Fourth Edition, Vol, 8, note-3 to Para-1099), <br> Their such bold opinion foyr hundreg years ago in 1610 could give a check (o the arbitrary exercise of power by the Crown, by four hundred years later, the learneq Additional Attorney-General of Bangladesp, contended that the Judges of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, are not entitled o say so in respect of the Fifth Amendment Act, since there was an ouster clause. <br> Halsbury’s Laws of England (Fourh Edition Vol. 8) describes Royal proclama- tions in this manner: <br> “1098 . Use of proclamations. Procla- mations may be legally used to call attention to the provisions of existing laws, or to make or alter regulations over which the Crown has a discretionary authority, either at com- mon law or by statute. Thus, the Crown may by proclamation summon or dissolve Parliament, declare war or peace, and prom- ulgate blockades and lay embargoes on ship- ping in time of war...... <br> 1099 . Restrictions on proclamations. Under the general rule which restrains the Crown from legislating apart from Parlia- ment, it is well-settled law that the Sovereign’s proclamation, unless authorized in that behalf by statute, cannot enact any new law, or make provisions contrary to old ones...,,. <br> In modern times, the purpose ol a Royal proclamation was confined and restricted to notify the existing law but can neither make law nor abrogate any ..  <br>  But by proclamations, laws cannot h\"' made and in all the Constitutions of the ¢V lized world the power to legislate is alway® with the concerned legislative body authority as spelt out in the respect™ Constitutions.                           The Proclamation dated August 20, 1975 was made by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, a Minister in the Cabinet of the Government of Bangladesh. As a Minister, he had specific functions under the Constitution but by any stretch of imagina- tion, it did not authorize him to seize the office of President of Bangladesh. No author- ity or legal provision has been mentioned in the Proclamation justifying his such assump- tion of power.<br>  It appears that on the early morning of August 15, 1975, Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed merrily changed the Constitution of Bangladesh and seized the office of President although without any legal authority. All the other Commanding Officers of the Armed Forces readily declared their allegiance to the new ‘President’ and his ‘Government’ appar- ently without any protest although on their commission as officers, they all took oath to be faithful to Bangladesh and its Constitution and bear true allegiance to the President... <br> The ‘reign’ of Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed lasted for 82 (eighty two) days. On November 6, 1975 he handed over the office of President of Bangladesh to Justice Abusadat Mohammad Sayem. The history and the reasons, which led Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed to abdicate in favour of Justice Sayem, were not explained to us with any details. All we could gather from the sub- missions made by the learned Advocates and their written arguments that there was a coup and a counter coup during the first week of November, 1975, the chain of command in the army in Dhaka Cantonment broke down, large sections of army personnel revolted lcading to the whole-sale killing of a large number of officers of the army. Colonel Taher rescued Major General Ziaur Rahman, fhe Chief of Army Staff, from his residence in the cantonment. <br>  This narration of the events may not be absolutely accurate but the real facts may never be known and in any case not very nec- essary for deciding the legal issues involved in this rule but stated only as a sequel leading to the assumption of office of President b; Justice Sayem. But how and what chain of events led the Chief Justice of Bangladesh to become not only the President of Bangladesh but also the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA), is far from clear. But in any case he was there as the President of Bangladesh and the CMLA as apparent from the Proclama- tion dated November 8, 1975.  The office of CMLA is a relic from the past. In the erstwhile Pakistan, General Ayub Khan was appointed CMLA by the Proclamation dated October 7, 1958 and again General Yahya Khan declared himself as the CMLA on March 25, 1969.  Earlier, although Martial Law was clamped on the country since August 15, 1975 but apparently no Martial Law Administrator was appointed but this time Justice Sayem by the Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, made some modifica- tions in the earlier proclamation and also appointed the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc; the Chief of Naval Staff, Commodore MH Khan, PSN., BN and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Martial MG Tawab SJ, S.Bt, PSA, BAF, as Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators.  Justice Sayem remained CMLA till November 29, 1976 and resigned from the office of President on April 21, 1",
      "178. As it appears in the above Proclamation dated April 6, 1979 the reasons for imposing Martial Law arc as follows :— <br> “ WHEREAS in the interest of peace, order, security, progress, prosperity and development of the country the whole of Bangladesh was placed under Martial Law on 15 August, 1975.” <br> But as it appears in the Preamble of the Procla- mation dated 20th August, 1978 no indication of any grave situation was given. The Parliament was very  “much in existence as on 15-8-75 and further in view  of the death of the then President, the then Vice President was to take the charge of the President till a new President was elected. As such how the situa- tion for declaring Martial Law as indicated above arose on August 15, 1975 ? <br> Further in the above Order the reason for revok- ing the Martial Law was given as follows :— <br> “AND, WHEREAS the situation in the country in all respect has since improved, and all other authorities and institution in the country may now properly function in accordance with the Constitution and the law.”  But however clause (O) of the above proclama- tion the following unusual power was given to the President:— <br> “(0) the President may, for the purpose of removing any difliculty that may arise in giving effect to any provision of this Proclamation make, by order, such provisions as he deems necessary or expedient and every such order shall have effect notwithstanding anything con- tained in the Constitution or in any other law for the time being in force.”  Considering the above clause (O), the High Court Division held that the above proclamation sought to subordinate the Constitution as clause (O) of the above Proclamation provided that the                President may make any order “notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution” though till the abo:'c Proclamation the President did not hi:l\\'C any such power and thus this Proclamation bestowed “Supra Constitutional’ power on the then President of Bangladesh.  ",
      "177. Then while the Parliament was already in session and The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 which is under challenge, had already been enacted and was publishcd in Bangladesh Gazette on April 6, 1979, by The Proclamation Dated April 6, 1979 which was published in the Bangladesh Gazette Extraordinary on 7th April, 1979 . This was the last proclamation issued by the Chief Martial Law Administrator by which Martial Law was revoked with effect from 8-00 PM of April, 6, 1979.  ",
      "176. The High Court Division held that though in the Preamble of the above Order the object as shown was to replace the remaining portion of the undemocratic  provisions incorporated in the Constitution by the Fourth Amendment, but many of the provisions incorporated by the Fourth Amendment have already been dismantled by Martial Law Regulations. Moreover, by the above Order not only the office of the President with all the poWers provided by the Fourth Amendment were kept very much intact but by inserting Article 92A, undemocratic provisions, the Parliament was made subservient to the President for all practical purpos- es with the view that in an unlikely event, even if the Parliament fails to make grants or to pass the budg- et under Articles 89 and 90, or refuses or reduces the demands for grants, under the above Article 92A the President, without any worries about the funds, could dissolve the Parliament at his pleasure. In this way the then President of Bangladesh by the above Order of 1978 became the most powerful Chief Executive virtually without any checks and balance either from the Parliament or from any body else. However, the above Article 92A was omitted by the Twelfth Amendment by which though the Parliamentary system of Government was restored, but the supervisory power of the Supreme Court over the subordinate judiciary, as was given in Atticle 116 of the original Constitution, was nol restored and it remained with the Executive. Further many provisions of the Fourth Amendment have not yet been disturbed, as if, those being pieces of dem- ocratic principle were required to be kept intact,  ",
      "175. Regarding the submission of the petition- ers that because of the Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment had to be made has also no substance. Assuming that Fourth Amendment was violative of the basic features of the Constitution, there was no challenge of the Fourth Amendment in the Supreme               Court as were done in the case of the Eighth Amendment as well as in the present casc,  ",
      "174. The next is the Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of 1978) dated Sth December, 1978. <br> The Preamble of the above Order shows that the object of the above Order was only to replace the remaining portion of the undemocratic provisions of the Constitution incorporated by the Fourth Amendment. But this is not correct. It may be noted that earlier by Proclamation Order No.l of 1977 changes were made only in the English Text of some amendments of the Constitution and the Bengali Text of those amendments remained as it is. By this Order similar changes were made in the Bengali Text. Further, changes were also made by inserting Sub Article (1A), (1B) and (1C) in Article 142 of' the Constitution providing that for amendment of the preamble or any provisions of Articles 8, 48, 56, 58, 80, 92A or this sub Article (1A), referendum to be held. Further Articles 92A and 145A were also inserted giving the President wider powers.  ",
      "173. As it appears by the above Order, amongst others, sub Article (1) of Article 102 was restored to its original position along with incidenta] amendments and the Supreme Court was again made to consist of the “Appellate Division™ and the “High Court Division” with effect from December | of 1977 and in Article 44 the words “High Court™ was substituted by the words “High Court Division”. As stated earlier, by Second Proclamation (seventh Amendment) Order, 1976, separate Courts such a “Supreme Court” and “High Court” were set up with effect from 13th August, 1976.  ",
      "172. The next is the Second Proclamation (Tenth  Amendment)  Order, 1977 (Secong Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977), dated 27th November, 1977.  ",
      "171. As it appears the above Regulation, amongst others, provided that even if the Government had unlawfully taken over a property as abandoned, the same shall remain as abandoned  and any judgment declaring otherwise would be ineffective.    ",
      "170. The next is the Abandoned Properties (Supplementary Provisions) Regulations, 1977 (Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977), dated 17th October, 1977.  ",
      "169. According to the High Court Division the above Order provided that to ascertain the confi- dence of the people in General Ziaur Rahman, a countrywide referendum was to be held on May 30, 1977 on the basis of direct adult franchise. The above Referendunr was conceived and conducted under the MLO No.1 of 1977 and <br> “(a) This was done in order to ascertain the confidence of the voters in President Major General Ziaur Rahman, <br> (b) This kind of referendum is unknown to the Constitution, or any law of the land”,  ",
      "168. The High Court Division found that by it—<br> “(a) The Second and Third Proclamations  were changed. <br> (b) Basic features of the Constitution were changed. <br> (¢) In the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution, after paragraph 3, a new                paragraph, namely paragraph 3A was inserted in order to validate the proclama- tions, MLRs, MLOs ete, including the amendments of the Constitution which amongst others, provided that: <br> (i) The Proclamations etc and the acts taken thercon were validated and those cannot be questioned before any Court. <br> (ii)All amendments of the Constitution were sought to be validly made.  <br>  (iii)The Proclamations: MLRs and MLOs, were to be treated as the Acts of Patliament.”  <br>  The next is the Referendum Order, 1977 (Martial Law Order No.1 of 1977) dated 1st May, 1977.  ",
      "167. The next is the Court's Jurisdiction (Restriction) Regulation, 1977 (Martial Law Regulation No.1 of 1977) dated March 9, 1977. <br> By the above Regulation restrictions were imposed upon the power of High Court to make interim orders and restrictions were also imposed upon the power of other Courts to pass temporary or interim injunction. <br> The next is the Order dated 21-4-1977, pub- lished in the Bangladesh Gazette Extra Ordinary on April 21, 1977. <br> The above Order disclosed that on being nomi- nated under clause (aa) of the Proclamation dated 20-8-1975, Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem assumed the Office of the President but the High Court Division as it appears found that previously Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, by Proclamation dated November 8, 1976, assumed the position of only the Chief Martial Law Administrator and he nominated General Ziaur Rahman to be the President of Bangladesh in that capacity. <br> The next is the Proclamations (Amendment) Order 1977, i.e. Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977 dated April 23, 1977 . By this Order, as described in details later on BISMILLAH-AR-RAHMAN-AR- RAHIM was inserted above the Preamble of the Constitution and the second and fourth paragraphs of the Preamble as well as Articles 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 25, 38 and 141 of the Constitution were drastically changed and further paragraph 3A was inserted in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution.  ",
      "166. The above Regulation repealed the Political Parties Act 1962 (Act Il of 1962) and Political Parties (Prohibition) Ordinance 1975 (XLVI of 1975). <br> Then came the Third Proclamation dated 29th November, 1976 which proclaimed as follows:— <br> “WHEREAS I, Abusadat Mohammad Sayem, President of Bangladesh and Chief Martial Law Administrator, assumed, by the Proclamation of the 8th November, 1975, the powers of the Chief Martial Law Administrator and appointed                the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy and Air Force as Deputy Chief Martial Law Adminis- trators; And whereas 1 do now feel that it is in the national interest that the powers of the Chief Martial Law Administrator should be exercised by Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc, the Chief of Army Staff; Now, therefore, in exercise of all powers enabling me in this be and in mod- ification of the provisions of the Proclamations of the 20th August, 1975, and 8th November, 1975, 1, Abusadat Mohammad Sayem, resident of Bangladesh, do hereby hand over the Office of Martial Law Administrator to Major General Ziaur Rahman BU, psc., who shall hereafter exercise all the powers of Chief Martial Law Administrator including the powers” <br> (a) to appoint new Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators, Zonal Martial Law Administrators, and Sub-Zonal Martial Law Administrators, <br> (b) to amend the Proclamations of the 20th August, 1975, 8th November, 1975 and This Proclamation, <br> (c) to make Martial Law Regulations and Orders, and (d) to do any other act or thing or to take any other action as he deems necessary in the national interest or for the enforcement of Martial Law”. <br> The views of the High Court Division in respect of the above order is as follows: <br> by the Third Proclamation dated November 29, 1976. <br> (a) “Justice ASM Sayem handed over the office of CMLA to Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc.  (b) The Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU psc would exercise all the powers of CMLA with powers amongst others (0 amend the Proclamations dated 20-8-75, 8-11-76 and 29-11-76.\"    ",
      "165. Then came The Political Parties Regulation, 1976 (Martial Law Regulation No. XXII of 1976) dated July 28, 1976.  ",
      "164. The next is the Second Proclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976 . (Second Proclamation Order No 1V of 1976) dated May 4 1976. <br> 'It may be noted here that in the original Constitution Article 44 provided as follows:— <br> \"44(1) The right to move the Supreme. Court, In accordance with clause (1) of Article. 102, for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this part, I guaranteed, <br> (2) Without prejudice o the poviers of i, Supreme Court under Article 102, Parliamen may by law empower any other Court, withip the local limits of its jurisdiction, 1o exercise 41y or any of those powers”, <br> But by Fourth Amendment sub Article (1) of Article 102 was omitted and Article 44 was substi- tuted as follows;— <br> “Parliament may be law cstablish 4 Constitutional Court, tribunal or commission for the enforcement of fundamental rights” <br> By the above Order 1976, amongst others, some amendments were made to the proclamation dated November 8, 1975 predominantly restoring original Article 44 as it existed before the Fourth Amendment but however without restoring sub Article (1) of Article 102 and the above Order also established separate “Supreme Court” and the *“High Court” along with other incidental changes. As it appears by Order dated August 11, 1976 the above changes came into effect on and from August 13, 1976.  ",
      "163. The next is the Second Proclamation (Sixth  Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No.llI of 1976) dated May 4th 1976. <br> As it appears by the above order, amongst oth- ers, by inserting clause (eb) to the Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, the proviso to Article 38 of the Constitution which is in respect of freedom of association other than in the name or on the basis of any religion as its basis or purpose, was omitted.  ",
      "162. The next is the Second Proclamation (Third Amendment) Order, 1975 (Sccond Procla- mation Order No.Ill of 1975) dated December 31, 1975 <br> As it appears by the above Order amongst oth- ers by inserting clause (gb) to the Proclamation dated November 8, 1975, the Bangladesh Collabo- rator’s (Special Tribunals) Order 1972 ( PO No 8 of 1972), was omitted from the First Schedule to the Constitution.  ",
      "161. Then came the “Proclamation” dated the  8th November, 1975 which proclaimed as follows:  WHEREAS the whole of Bangladesh has been under Martial Law since the 15th day of August, 1975;  And whereas Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, who placed the country under Martial Law, has made over the Office of President of Bangladesh to me and I have entered upon that Office on the 6th day of November, 1975;  And whereas in the interest of peace, order, security, progress, Keep in force the Martial Law proclaimed on the 15th August, 1975:  And whereas for the effective enforcement of Martial Law it has become necessary for me to assume the powers of Chief Martial Lav Administrator and to appoint Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators and to make some modifications in the Proclamation of the 200 August, 1975;  <br>  Now, therefore, I, Mr Justice Abu Sadat  Mohammad Sayem, President of Bangladesh,                do hereby assume the powers of Chief Martial Law Administrator and appoint the Chief of Army Staff; Major General Ziaur Rahman BU psc; the Chief of Naval Staff, Commodore MI1 Khan, PSN, BN, and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal MG Tawab, SJ S.Bt. PSA, BAF, as Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator and declare that— <br><br> “(a) Martial Law Regulations and Orders shall be made by the Chief Martial Law Administrator;  <br>  (b) all Martial Law Regulations and Orders in force  immediately  before  this Proclamation shall be deemed to have been made by the Chief Martial Law Administrator and shall continue to remain in force until amended or repealed by the Chief Martial Law Administrator; <br> (c)Parliament shall stand dissolved and be deemed to be so dissolved with effect from the 6th day of November, 1975, and general elections of Members of Parliament shall be held before the end of February, 1977; <br> (d)the persons holding office as Vice- President, Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Ministers, Ministers of State, Deputy Ministers and Whips, Immediately before this Proclamation, shall be deemed to have ceased to hold office with effect from the 6th day of November, 1975; <br> (e)an Ordinance promulgated by the President shall not be subject to the limi- tation as 1o its duration prescribed in the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh (hereinafter referred as the Constitution); <br> (f)the provisions of Article 48 of lh'c Constitution shall remain suspended until further order; <br> (g)Part VIA of the Constitution shall stand omilted;  <br>     (h)the Chief Martial Law Administrator may  appoint  Zonal or Sub-Martial Law Administrators; <br> (i) I may, by order notified in the official Gazette, amend this Proclamation: <br> (j)this Proclamation shall be a part of the Proclamation of the 20th August, 1975, and the Proclamation of the 20th August, 1975, shall have effect as modified by this Proclamation™. <br><br> The High Court Division found that some of its salient features are as follows : — <br> (i)Mr Justice Abu Sadat Mohammed Sayem entered upon the Office of the President on 6 November ,1975 <br> (ii)He assumed the Office of the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and appointed three Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators ( DCMLA) <br> (iii)Parliament was dissolved with effect from 6 November, 1975. <br> (iv)Part VI A of the Constitution was omit- ted <br> (v)The Proclamation dated 8 November, 1975 modified the Proclamation dated 20 August, 1975 and became its part <br> On consideration of the above proclamations it appeared to the High Court Division that; <br>  (i)“Justice Abu Sadat Mohammed Sayem, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh had no authority to enter into the Office of the President of Bangladesh and to assume the power of CMLA , which was beyond the ambit of the Constitution <br> (ii)He had no lawful authority to dissolve the Parliament <br> (iii) Bangladesh was ruled for the next three and a half years without any Parliament,                as such, lost s Republican character for the said period, <br> (iv) Me had no lawtul authority to suspend any provision or any part of the Constitu- tion <br> (v) e had no lawful authority to make any Proclamation, Martinl Law Regulation or Order, <br> (vi) Justice Abu Sadat Mohammed Sayem  violated the Constitution of Bangladesh <br> (vii) He acted as a usurper in entering the Office of the President and in assuming the powers of CMLA\"  ",
      "160. On considerations of the above noted  Proclamations it appears that <br><br> (i) “Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed had no lawful authority to seize the office of the President of Bangladesh, as such, he was an usurper <br> (i)  He had no authority to suspend any pro vision of the Constitution <br> (iii) He had no authority to make any Proclamation, Martial Law Regulation or Order, beyond the ambit of (he Constitution <br> (iv) He destroyed the supremacy of (he Constitution by making it subject to the Proclamation, Martial Law Regulation and Order <br> (v) He ousted the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, one of the three pillars  of the State <br> (vi) The Proclamations etc. were made non justifiable before the Court of law as such the concept of the rule of law was destroyed”.  ",
      "159. In respect of this Proclamation the com- ments of the High Court Division are as follows:— <br> ...................................................... <br> ......................................... <br> (i)  “Certain provisions of the Constitution were suspended and modified, <br> (ii) The Proclamation and Martial Law Regulations and Orders became effec- tive inspite of the Constitution or other laws <br> (iii) The Constitution remained enforced but subject to the Proclamation, Martial Law Regulations and Orders <br>  (iv)  No Court including the Supreme Court would have any power to call in ques- tion the Proclamation, Martial Law Regulations or Orders”,  ",
      "158. AS it appears to decide the above issues, at first the Court Division referred to the  proclamations dated 20 August 1975, 8 November 1975 and 29 November 1975 and also different Martial Law Regulations and Orders.   The first is the “Proclamation” dated 20th August 1975 which proclaimed as follows: <br>  \"WHEREAS I, Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, with the helg and mercy of the Almighty Allah and relying upon the blessings of the people, have taken over all and full pow- ers of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh with effect from the morning of the 15th August, 1975 . <br> <br>      AND WHEREAS I placed, on the morning of the 15th August, 1975 the whole of Bangladesh under Martial Law by a declaration broadcast from all stations of Radio Bangladesh; <br> AND WHEREAS, with effect from the mom- ing of the 15th August, 1975, I have suspended the provisions of article 48, in so far as it relates of election of the President of Bangladesh, and Article 55 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, and modified the pro- visions of article 148 thereof and form I of the Third Schedule thereto to the effect that the oath of office of the President of Bangladesh shall be administered by the Chief Justice of Bangladesh and that the president may enter upon office before he takes the oath; <br> Now, thereof, I, Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, in exercise of all powers enabling me in this behalf, do hereby declare that— <br> (a) I have assumed and entered upon the Office of the President of Bangladesh with effect om the morning of the 15th August, 1975; <br> (b) I may make, from time to time, Martial W Regulations and Orders— <br> <br> i) providing for setting up Special Courts or Tribunals for the trial and punishment of any offence under  such Regulations or Orders or for contravention thereof, and of offences under any other law; <br> (ii) prescribing penalties for offences under such Regulations or Orders or for contravention thereof and special penalties for offences under any other law; <br> (iii) empowering any Court or Tribunal to try and punish any offence under such Regulation or Order or the contravention thereof’ <br> (iv) barring the jurisdiction of any Court or Tribunal from trying any offence specified in such Regulations or Orders; <br><br> (c) I may rescind the declaration of Martial Law made on the moming of the 15th August, 1975, at any time, either in respect of the whole of Bangladesh or any part thereof, and may again place the whole of Bangladesh or any part there- of under Martial Law by a fresh declaration; <br> (d) this Proclamation and the Martial Law Regulations and Orders made by me in pur- suance thereof shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh or in any law for the time being in force; <br> (e) the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh shall, subject to this Proclamation and the Martial Law Regulations and Orders made by me in pursuance thereof, continue to remain in force; <br> (f) all Acts, Ordinance, President’s Orders and other Orders,  Proclamations rules, regulations, bye-laws, notifications and other legal instruments in force on the moming of the 15th August, 1975, shall continue to remain in force until repealed, revoked or amended ;               <br>  (g) no Court, including the Supreme Court, or tribunal or authority shall have any power to call in question in any manner whatsoever or declare illegal or void this Proclamation or any Martial Law Regulation or Order made by me in pursuance thereof, or any declaration made by or under this Proclamation, or mentioned in this Proclamation to have been made, or anything  \"done or any action taken by or under this  Proclamation, or mentioned in this  Proclamation to have been done or taken, or anything done or any action taken by or under any Martial Law Regulation or Order made by me in pursuance of this Proclamation ; <br> (h) I may, by order notified in the official Gazette, amend this Proclamation.  ",
      "157. Regarding the point of usurpers it Was argued as follows: <br> (i) On the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur  Rahman, President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, on August 15, 1975, Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed in total violation of the Constitution, illegally seized the office of President of Bangladesh, as such, he wge an usurper. <br> (ii) He had no authority to function as the President, as such, the Proclamation of Martial Law on August 20, 1975, and his tenure as the purported President for 82(eighty-two) days was illegal.  <br>  (iii) The assumption of office of a President of Bangladesh by the then Chief Justice of Bangladesh on November 6, 1975 and the assumption of powers of the Chief Martial Law Administrator by the Second Proclamation issued on November 08, 1975 was in total disregard of the Constitution. <br> (iv) Appointment of Major General Ziaur Rahman, as the Chief Martial Administrator by the Third Proclamation issued on November 29, 1976, was made, beyond the ambit and in total disregard of the Constitution <br> (v) Appointment of Major General Ziaur Rahman as the President of Bangladesh on April 21, 1977, was made in violation and in total disregard of the Constitution. <br> (vi) As such, all the Martial Law Proclamations, Martial Law Regulations including the Martial Law Regulation No. VII of 1977 and the Martial Law Orders, were made by the usurpers of the office of President in violation and in total disre- gard of the Constitution , as such, illegal, void ab initio and nonest in the eye of law.                ",
      "156. As it appears the grounds on which the Fifth Amendment was challenged before the High Court Division are that— <br> (a) Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Justice ASM Sayem and General Zjaur Rahman having no authority to assume the post of President and Chief Martjal Law Administrators and accordingly are usurpers and <br> (b) Fifth Amendment negates and is also  repugnant to the basis feature of the Constitution.  ",
      "155. Now the question is whether all the leg- islative measures i.e. the Proclamations, Martial - Law Regulations and Orders, were promulgated/ made during the period from 15 August, 1975 upto April 9, 1979 by legally constituted authority or by usurpers and if by usurper whether those legislative measures were illegal, void and non east and whether the Second Parliament, itself, even by two third majority, could pass any law repugnant to the Constitution and whether the Fifth Amendment is ultra vires the Constitution,  ",
      "154. Regarding nationalism though‘ we expressed the view that being political issue, Parliament is to take decision in this regard, but if in place of “Bangladeshi” the word ‘Bangalee’ is sub- stituted in terms of the judgment and order of the High Court Division, then all passports, identity ca;ds, nationality certificates issued by the Government and other prescribed authorities, cer- tificates issued by educational institutions, visa forms and other related documents of the govern- ment will have to be changed, reprinted or reissued. Moreover, the Bangladeshi nationals who will return to Bangladesh as well as those travelling abroad will also face serious complications with the immigration authorities abroad. Apart from the above and other hackles and harassments, this change of the nationality would also cost millions from the public exchequer. So for wider public inter- est the substituted Article 6 is to be retained.  "

      "18. It appears that the High Court Division cor- rectly followed the principle laid down in the case of Nausher Ali Sarder vs State reported in 39 DLR (AD) 194 and in the case of Dipok Kumar Sarker vs State reported in 40 DLR (AD) 139 and therefore no injustice has been committed by the High Court Division in commuting the sentence.  In view of the discussions, as above, we find nothing to interfere with the judgment of the High Court Division and accordingly both the petitions are dismissed.                 APPELLATE DIVISION (Criminal) MM Ruhul Amin CJ | <br> GMM  Rahman.......Appellant  <br> Md Tafazzul Islam J  <br> Md Abdul Matin J  <br> Md Abdul Aziz  <br>  ---------------------  ",
      "17. Heard Mr AK Badrul Hugq, the learmed Counsel appearing for the petitioner in Criminal Petition for Leave to appeal No.17 of 2009 and Mr ASM Abdul Mobin, the leamed Deputy Attorney- General (Mrs Mahfuza Begum, the learned Assistant with him) appearing for the petitioner in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.38 of 2009 and Mr ASM Abdul Mobin, the learned Deputy Attorney-General (Mrs Mahfuza Begum, the learned Assistant Attorney-General with him) appearing for the respondent in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.17 of 2009 and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record.  ",
      "16. As to sentence the High Court Division held as under : <br> “The accused is not a hardened criminal. The death of the deceased was caused by him in sequel of bitter matrimonial relationship. He caused the haematoma with any hard substance on the occipital region on the head of the decea- sed which resulted her instantaneous death. The accused has three minor children and an invalid first wife. In view of these facts and circum- stances, we are of the view that justice will be met if the sentence of death awarded to the accused is commuted to imprisonment for life.”  ",
      "15. In the instant case, the death of the deceased Joyanti Munshi in the bedroom of her hus- band accused Azam Reza is not disputed. According to the prosecution she was assaulted to death. On the other hand, the defence is that she committed sui- cide by hanging. The deceased was the wife of the accused who met with death in the bedroom of the accused, while she was living with the accused. The presence of the accused in the house at the material time is not disputed rather is supported and proved by evidence on record and the death of the deceased was within the special knowledge of the accused. The accused came out with the story of suicide by hanging which he failed to prove and as such the  High Court Division rightly held the accused guilty of murder.  ",
      "14. The High Court Division afier considering the medical evidence about the haematoma held as under : <br> “In view of the authorities of medical jurisprudence quoted above without any frac- ture of the skull and injury on the meninges hemorrhage may be occurred on the brain resulting instantaneous death. The haematoma on the right parieto-occipital area and a sub- arachnoid hemorrhage in the right parietal and both frontal lobes clearly show that a blow with hard substance was given on the parieto-occipi- tal region resulted sub-arachnoid hemorrhage on the right parietal and both the frontal lobes and such sub-arachnoids hemorrhage caused cerebral failure resulting death of the deceased. So there is no reason to discard the medical evi- dence as to cause of death. The doctors rightly opined that the death of the deceased was due to head injuries, which was ante-mortem and homicidal in nature. In this way we are unable to agree with above submission of Mr. Khandker Mahbub Hossain. Thus it is well established that the deceased was done to death. After intentionally causing the death of the deceased, in order to colour such homicidal death as suicidal one the dead body was hanged. Thus the prosecution could prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the offence of murder was committed.”  ",
      "13. The High Court Division further held that the death of the deceased could not be attributed to hanging as under: <br> “In the instant case besides the ligature mark other signs and symptoms of death due to hanging like (1) petichial haemorrhage and ecchymoises anterior around the ligature mark, (2) mark of dribbled saliva, (3) tear of the inti- ma of carotid arteries with extravasations of blood with their walks, (4) congested and haemorhage in the lymph nodes above and below the ligature mark, () fracture or disloca- tion of cervical vertebra and both external and internal injuries on head were present. So in the present case the death of the deceased could not be attri-buted to hanging.”                 ",
      "12. The High Court Division after hearing the reference and the appeal and the jail appeal held as under: <br> “The above evidence of PWs 1-6 as to presence of marks of hurt on the person of the deceased her normal eyes, nose etc and absence of any the symptoms of death by hanging are not tainted and do not suffer from any infirmity. Moreover their such evidence had gone unchal- lenged. Therefore, there is no reason to discard the same.”  ",
      "11. The learned Judge on consideration of the evidences on record and the facts and circumstances of the case convicted and sentenced the accused as foresaid and made the reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for confirmation of the sentence of death awarded to the accused. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with that judg- ment and order of conviction and sentence he con- vict preferred the above regular appeal as well as the  jail appeal.  ",
      "10. Afier closing of the prosecution evidence the accused was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, when he submitted a written statement contending that the deceased com- mitted suicide by hanging. He filed some documents including the certified copies of the statements of his domestic helps Alpana, Nurunnahar, Nayantara and Sabina Begum, his first wife Atia Sultana and sister Shampa Reza recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in connection with the Unnatural Death Case by PW 10 SI Biman Kumar Das on 9-1-2004 and also the statements of his domestic helps Nayantara, Alpana. Nurunnahar and driver Khorshed Alam, Shahadat Hossain, a key maker, the security guards and supervisor of apart- ment building where he lived, recorded under sec-  tions 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the present case and also some papers of Ramna Police Station Case No. 24-1-2004, arose out of the incident of road accident the ambulance carrying the dead body of the deccased to the  morgue faced.  ",
      "9. At the trial in order to prove the charge the prosecution examined 13 witnesses, of whom PW I Lusil Sadekin is the informant and mother of the deceased, PW 2 Dr Shati Munshi is the sister of P\\WV 6 Dr Mabubur Rahman is her husband. PW 3 Mofezzelatunnessa Doly and her sister PW § Fazilatunnessa are the relatives of the deceased. PW 4 Dr Mahbub Ahmed is the house physician of the accused. PW 12 Rabab Sultana is a seizure list wit- ness and PW 13 Kanta Saadat is an office colleague of the deceased. They are the private witnesses. The remaining five are official witnesses, of whom PW 2 Dr Md Akhteruzzman is the Chairman of the Medical Board, held post mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased, PW 8 ASI Anjuman Akhtar is the police officer, recorded the Unnatural Death Case on the basis of informant in writing given by the accused, PW 9 Abdur Rab Sarder is the constable escorted the dead body of the deceased to the morgue for post mortem examination, PW 10 SI Biman Kumar Das is the investigating officer of the Unnatural Death Case and the first investigating officer of the present case and PW 11 Munshi Ruhul Kuddus, a Police Inspector attached to detective branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police is the second and last investigating officer, who took up investi- gation of the case on 17-1-2004 and after conclusion of investigation submitted charge sheet against the accused.  ",
      "8. The defence case is that of innocence and false implication and that the deceased committed suicide by hanging.                ",
      "7. At about 8-25 PM the informant filed a written complaint with Gulshan Police Station against the accused alleging that he caused the death of the deceased, but the police did not record the case treating the written complaint as FIR. They recorded that written complaint as GD Entry No. 690 dated 9-1-2004 on the plea that an unnatural death case had already been recorded. A Medical Board held autopsy of the dead body of the deceased and reported that death of the deceased was due 1o the head injury, which was homicidal. Next day on 10-1-2004 at 11-15 PM the informant lodged anoth- er written complaint with Gulshan Police Station against the accused, on the basis of which a regular murder case was recorded. Accordingly final report was submitted in the Unnatural Death Case. After investigation of the murder case charge sheet was submitted against the accused, who eventually was put on trial in the Druto Bichar Tribunal No.4, Dhaka, wherein charge under sections 302 and 201 of the Penal Code was framed against him to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.  ",
      "6. On the same day at about 3-25 PM before arrival of the informant party the accused in writing informed Gulshan Police Station that the deceased committed suicide by hanging. On the basis of which Unnatural Death Case No.2 of 2004 was recorded and SI Biman Kumar Das was entrusted with the investigation of the same, who went to the house of the accused and made inquest of the dead body of the deceased at 4-05 PM and sent the dead body to the morgue for post-mortem examination for ascertaining the cause of death. He seized one oma, a revolving chair and a cot as alamats from the place of occurrence bedroom under a seizure list and recorded the statements of the maid servants, the first wife, sister and driver of the accused and others under section 161 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure.  ",
      "5. On 9-1-2004 at 1-30 PM Shampa Reza, the sister of the accused, over telephone informed Mr Maht?ubur Rahman, husband of Dr Shati Munshi, the s!stcr to the decease had committed suicide by hanging. Dr Mahbabur Rahman and Dr Shati lnforrned the matter to the mother of the deceased, the informant. Then they went to the house of the ac.cusc':d and found the dead body of the deceased lying in the bedroom on a cot with some injuries on  the different parts of the body including one swelling on the back of the head.  ",
      "4. The short facts of the case are as under:- The deceased Joyanti Munshi daughter of informant Lusil Sadekin was an Architect and Senior Teacher of Australian International School at Gulshan, Dhaka. On 10-3-2000 her marriage with accused Azam Reza was solemnized. After marriage they had a happy conjugal life for 3'/, years. The deceased used to live in the house of the accused. She gave birth to a son named Turja by the accused. At the time of occurrence Turja was 2/, years of age. In the meantime, illicit relationship developed between the accused and Afsana Mimi, an actress, in sc'quel of which the accused started misbehaving with and torturing the deceased. On the night fol- lowing 8-1-2004 in the bedroom the accused assaulting the deceased intentionally caused her death,  ",
      "3. Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.17 of 2009 has been filed by the accused peti- tioner whereas Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.38 of 2009 has been filed by the State on the ground of inadequacy of sentence and both the petitions having been head together are being dis- posed of by this judgment.  ",
      "2. These petitions for leave to appeal are directed against the judgment and order dated 20-7- 2008 and 21-7-2008 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No.6 of 2005 corre- sponding to Criminal Appeal No.322 of 2005 and Jail Appeal No.40 of 2005 sentencing the petitioner to life imprisonment.

      "49. It is true that the Company Bench cannot interfere in the internal management of the Com- pany but in the instant case the previous AGMs could not transect on the important agendas pertain- ing to receipt and adoption of Audited Accounts for the relevant years and approving any dividend as recommended by BoD as appearing in agenda Nos. 1 and 2 in the notice for the 22nnd AGM because of the injunction issued by the Company Bench and therefore the matter on those agendas could not be transected and the Company Bench therefore was moved under sections 81(2) and 85(3) of the Act and in making the Rule absolute, the High Court Division appears to have only granted ancillary and consequential order including those pertaining to fixing Record Date and conducting of 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs on condition that the balance sheet, financial statement and audited accounts for the year ending will December 31, 2005 is prepared afresh and a new Record Date to be fixed. Since these directions are ancillary and consequential in nature the High Court Division committed no illegality in exercising the power under section 85(3) of the Act. I‘t is pen.inent to mention here that Record Date is llnkf:d with the AGMs and it cannot be tied with the c.arher Record Date fixed under the SEC Notifica- tion and the Company Bench rightly considered Articles 137 and 140 of the Company in deciding the rights of the share-holders.  ",
      "48.  Thus it appears that the High Court Divi- sion correctly considered the scope of sections 81(2) and 85(3) of the Companies Act and also considered Regulation No. 46(2) of the 2003 in its true per- spective.  ",

It further appears that the High Court Division considered the power of the Company Bench in giving ancillary directives in the matter of  holding AGMs and after considering the provision  of section 85(3) of the Companies Act held as under:<br> “The Company Court has ample power 10  give ancillary directives in the matter of holding AGMs under section 85(3) Companies Act; the Court may order a meeting of the Company to  be called, held and conducted in such manner  as it thinks fit and give such ancillary directions  as in thinks expedient. This was so held in the                case of Satish Chandra Banik vs Dhaka Jute Mills Ltd reported in PLD 1968 (Dac) 610 = 19 DLR 280 and Ghiasuddin Ahmed vs Farugue reported in DLR (4D) 296.\"  ",
      "46. On question of Record Date the High Court Division considered the provision of section 46(2) of the 2003 regulations and held as under : <br> “In light of the above, this Court finds that driven by a misconception of applicable law and proceeding on the wrong premise by rely- ing on the SEC’s opinion of 9-12-2007, the BoD of the Bank exercised its jurisdiction erro- neously under Regulation 46(2) of the 2003 Regulations in maintaining the Record Date of 25.9-2005 for the delayed AGMs scheduled to be held in January, 2008 . At this juncture this Court is necessarily reminded of the steps already taken by this Court to variously retrain the bank from carrying out the business at the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs as were held but were adjourned only with regard to the agenda on the consideration of the financial statements and the declaration of dividend/bonus share, and in that regard remains satisfied of the fact that by reason of such partial adjournment of the AGMs otherwise held further to its judg- ment and orders dated 26-11-2007 in Matter Nos. 134 of 2005 and 149 of 2007 this Court to date remains in seisin of the matters of the fur- ther conduct of business pertaining or in rela- tion to such of the adjourned agenda of the AGMs, In this regard it is 1o be particularly noted that the orders of admission of this Court in all four matters under consideration were ' made at a time when the question or issue of the  legality of maintaining the Record Date of 25-  9-2005 and the repercussions or reverberations  thereof obviously remained determinable 'by this Court at a future date. It is on that premise that this Court in the said admission orders ar?d in securing the interest of the bank in gcncra! in keeping its internal mechanism running allowed for the meetings of 10-1-2008 and 31- 1-2008 to be held, albeit on the basis of trun-                           cated agenda to be variously considered in each. The bank was restrained under all four applications from transacting business under the agenda on which the issue of the Record Date of 25-9-2005 was initially thought to have had an impact or bearing upon. On a substan- tive consideration of all the four applications and appreciation of the fact that the Record Date as now found to have been maintained at 25-9-2005 without any legal basis, but that on -reliance of the same certain business has already, however, been transacted in the meet- ings held on 10-1-2008 and 31-1-2008, this Court must now necessarily find that the opera- tion of the Record Date of 25-9-2005 at those meetings as the prime determinant of dividends of certain groups of shareholders of the bank was without any legal basis. That being the case, this Court now finds that any business transacted at the said meetings of 10-1-2008 and 31-1-2008 must necessarily be held not to have been in accordance with law. In light of the same, and as submitted by both Dr Zahir and Mr Mahmud, it shall be and is within this Court’s jurisdiction in keeping with the judg- ments in Satish Chandra Banik vs Dhaka Jute Mills Ltd. reported in PLD 1968 Dacca 610 = 19 DLR 280 and Ghyasuddin Ahmed vs Faruque reported in 38 DLR. (AD) 1986, 296 to direct the bank to call, hold and conduct afresh the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs for the culcnq-.lr years 2003, 2004 and 2005 in complmm::: with the directives of this Court as hereunder.  ",
      "45. It appears that the High Court Division considered the question of maintainability of the petitions under sections 81(2) and 85(3) of the Act and held as under : <br> “For reasons already stated and the satis- faction above expressed with regard to the sub- missions made by Dr Zahir on this issue of the petitioners’ /ocus standi in Matter Nos. 1, 10 and 11 of 2008, this Court finds that even given the absence of the amendments that could have otherwise been introduced into the Act follow- ing the Indian example, the depository regime inherently and implicitly allows for an interpre- tation to be accorded to the relevant provisions as above referred to the 1999 Act and 2003 Regulations in a manner as facilitate a harmo- nious relationship between the depository and companies law regimes and allow for most of the petitioners in Matter Nos. 1, 10 and 11 of 2008 to be treated as members of the bank enjoying both corporate rights and benetits. Indeed, and it may in the future be considered by lawmakers prudent to do so, amendments by way of abundant caution could have been intro- duced into the Act, but failing or pending such exercise, in this Court’s opinion, there is noth- ing in the depository regime that shows that the existing legal framework is not sufticiently ade- quate to clothe most of the petitioners in gener- al and beneficial owners in a Company in par- ticular with the status of membership of a  Company. <br> Accordingly, on the question of maintain- ability of the three applications in Matter Nos. 1, 10 and 11 of 2008, this Court finds that all petitioners, save only those as are identificd hereinafter, are found to be shareholders in the bank as substantiated by information provided                to this Court pertaining to the details of the sharcholding in terms of UCB folio numbers and beneficial ownership (B/o) IDs and are thereby entitled to bring these applications under sections 81(2) and 85(3) of the Act.”  ",
      "44. He submits that the judgment of the High Court Division suffers from no illegality.  ",
      "43.  He further submits that the AGMs for calendar years 1998 to 2002 inclusive having been held on 9-9-2007 with a Record Date of 16-8-2007, the subsequent AGMs for the calendar years 2003 to 2005 could not have a Record Date earlier to 16-8- 2007 as it would create an anomaly and incongruity inasmuch as many of those shareholders who attended those AGMs on 9-9-2007 would then be disentitled to attend an participate in the dividend/ receive the bonus shares in the AGMs due to be held on 10-1-2008 on the one hand, and those persons who could not attend those AGMs on 9-9-2007 by reason of not being the shareholders then (and also now) would then be entitled to attend the AGMSs on 10-1-2008 merely because of the fact that they were  shart.:holders on 25-9-2005, totally ignoring the fact that in the intervening period they could not attend the AGMs, not being sharcholders, the High Court Division was justified in holding the AGMs afresh with a new record date to avoid such anomaly and  incongruity. ",
      "42. Mr Rokonuddin Mahmood, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent No. 18 in CA No. 319 of 2008 submits that letter dated 9-12-2007 of SEC being a mere “opinion on Record Date” of SEC expressed upon reference to its notification dated 26-11-2001, which had been issued prior to introduction of the concept of Record Date in 2003 for the first time by the Depository (User) Regula- tion 2003, and that the said notification also never used the word “Record Date”, but on the contrary it having emphasized on the shareholders’ entitlement to dividend, if recommended, the High Court Division was justified in ordering fresh holding of the AGMs with a direction to fix a new Record Date occurring within the period as specified in the judg- ment upon treating the said opinion of SEC as not being binding on the Board of UCBL.  ",
      "41.  He submits that the High Court Division  correctly decided the matter.  ",
      "40.  He submits that the effect of permitting a Record Date to be fixed on 25-9-2005 for holding an AGM on 10-1-2008 would conflict with Articles 137 and 140 of the Articles of Association which provide that a transferor of a share will be entitled to the dividend only upto the time his name is record- ed in the share register of the Company; as fixed                 Record Date of 25-9-2005 would ignore the practi- cal situation that hundreds of thousands of shares have passed hands in the meantime and a person who had sold his shares and served his connection with the Company will be deemed to be sharehold- er for the Company and receive 90% bonus share and attend the meeting when he is not a sharcholder  of the Company.  ",
      "39. He further submits that the effect of fix- ing record dated for the purpose of attending a General Meeting or receiving dividends is the same as a book closure with a suspended animation of the shareholding position as on the record date for the purpose of dividends and attending AGMs; section 42 of the Companies Act bars a Record Date to be fixed more than two years previous to the AGM.  ",
      "38. Dr M Zahir, the learned Counsel appear- ing for the respondent Nos. 1-6, 17 in CA No. 319 of 2008 submits that record being equivalent to book closure as provided in the Regulation 46(2) of the Depository (User) Regulations, 2003 the same cannot be fixed with a retrospective effect of more than 2 years. 3  ",
      "37. Dr M Zahir and Mr Khandker Mahbub- uddin Ahmed, the learned Counsels appearing for the respondent Nos. 1-16 in CANo. 319 0f 2008 and Dr M Zahir, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent No. 17 in CA No. 319 and Mr Rokon- uddin Mahmood, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent No. 18 in CA No. 319 of 2008 sup- ported the judgment and submitted that the impugned judgment suffers from no illegality.  ",
      "36. MrAhsanul Karim, the learned Advocate adopted the argument of both Mr Rafique-ul-Huq and Mr TH Khan and submitted that the appeals should be allowed.  ",
      "35. Mr TH Khan, the learned Counsel appearing for appellant in CA No. 320 of 2008 sub- mits that the High Court Division committed serious  error of law in disposing of the aforesaid   Company matters with directions, travelling beyond its jurisdiction and ignoring the settled principles of law that it cannot grant any relief unless the reliefs sought come strictly within the four corners of the Companies Act, especially sections 81, 85(3) and 396 of the said Act as in the present case, which resulted in an error in the decision, occasioning, fail- ure of justice.  ",
      "34. He submits that the High Court Division acted illegally, unlawfully and arbitrarily in declar- ing the record dated on 25-9-2005 for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs of the respondent No. 18 Company as illegal and directing to fix fresh record date in violation of direction of Securities and Exchange Commission dated 18-7-2004 and Regulation 46(2) read with Regulation 2(%) of the Depository (Uses) Regulations, 2003, especially when Record Date once fixed and acted upon cannot be changed and further directed to prepare fresh balance sheet in violation of sections 183(2), 183(4) and 190 of the Companies Act, 1994 and Rule 12(3A) of the Secu- rities and Exchange Rules, 1987 and Notification No. SEC/CFD/2001/Admin/02-03 dated 4-10-2001 and, as such, the said judgment and order dated 11- 6-2008 is liable to be set aside.  ",
      "33.  Mr Rafique-ul-Hugq, the learned Counsel appearing for the appellant in CA No. 319 of 2008 submits that the High Court Division acted illegally,                unlawfully and arbitrarily in declaring the Record Date i.c. 25-9-2005 fix by the respondent No. 18 Company for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs as ille- gal and directing to fix fresh Record Date AGMs for the said 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs instead of earli- er Record Date on 25-9-2005 and to prepare fresh balance sheet for the said AGMs without consider- ing that the reliefs as sought by the respondent Nos. | to 17 in the said Company Matter No. 1 of 2008 for declaring the carlier Record Date i.e. 25-9-2005 as illegal and direction upon the respondent No. 18 to fix fresh Record Date instead of earlier Record Date 25-9-2005 and to prepare fresh balance sheets for the said AGMs cannot be granted by the High Court Division under sections 81, 85(3) and 396 of the Companies Act, 1994 (the said Act) since the said sections do not provide any forum for the said reliefs as well as the reliefs as sought in the said Company Matter No. 1 of 2008 do not Come strict- ly within the four comers and scope of the provi- sions laid down in the said sections 81, 85(3) and 396 of the said Act invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court Division and, as such, the said judgment and order dated 11-6-2008 is liable to be set aside.  ",
      "32.  Heard the leamed Counsel and perused the paper books of the appeals and other papers on record.  ",
      "31.  Leave was granted to consider the above submissions.  ",
      "30. Mr Rafique-ul-Hug, the learned Counsel appearing the appellants in CA No. 321 of 2008 sub- mitted that the High Court Division acted illegally, unlawfully and arbitrarily in declaring the Record Date i.e. 25-9-2005 fix by the respondent No. I8 Company for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs as ille- gal and directing to fix fresh Record Date AGMs for the said 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs instead of earli- er Record Date on 25-9-2005 and to prepare fresh balance sheet for the said AGMs without consider- ing that the reliefs as sought by the respondent Nos. 1 to 17 in the said Company Matter No. 1 of 2008 for declaring the earlier record date i.e. 25-9-2005 as illegal and direction upon the respondent No. 18 to fix fresh Record Date instead of earlier Record Date 25-9-2005 and to prepare fresh balance sheets for the said AGMs cannot be granted by the High Court Division under sections 81, 85(3) and 396 of the Companies Act 1994 (the said Act) since the said sections do not provide any forum for the said reliefs as well as the reliefs as sought in the said Company Matter No. 1 of 2008 do not come strictly within the four corners and scope of the provisions laid down in the said sections 81, 85(3) and 396 of the said Act invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court Division and, as such,.the said judgment and order dated 11-6-2008 is liable to be set aside.  ",
      "29.  Mr Rafique-ul-Hug, the learned Counsel appearing the appellant in CA No, 319 of 2008 sub- mitted that the High Court Division acted illegally, unlawfully and arbitrarily in declaring the record date on 25-9-2005 for the 20th, 2Ist and 22nd AGM s of the respondent No. 18 Company as illegal and directing to fix fresh Record Date in violation of direction of Securities and Exchange Commission dated 18-7-2004 and Regulation 46(2) read with Rc.gulation 2(%) of the Depository (Uses) Regu- lations, 2003 especially when Record Date once fixed and acted upon cannot be changed in view of Notification No. SEC/CMRRCD/2001-14/Admin 03-03- dated 26-11-2001 read with Directive No.   SEC/8CDS/2:22/ 99/187 dated 18-7-2004 both issued by the Security and Exchange Commission and further directed to prepare fresh balance sheet in violation of sections 183(2), 183(4) and 190 of the Companies Act, 1994 and Rule 12(3A) of the Secu- rities and Exchange Rules, 1987 and Notification No. SEC/CFD/2001/ Admin/02-03 dated 4-10-2001 and, as such, the said judgment and order dated 11- 6-2008 is liable to be set aside.  ",
      "28.  He lastly submitted that the respondents lacked locus standi to ask for a direction to prepare balance sheets and profit and loss accounts afresh and change the Record Date since they were not members of the Company at those relevant times.  ",
      "27.  He submitted that accounts and balance sheets of a particular financial year for a Company, once audited and certified by the auditors and approved by the Board of Directors are published and become public documents and, as such, cannot be altered. As prescribed by section 38 of the Bank- ing Companies Act 1991, Accounts and Balance Sheets are prepared at the expiry of each financial year contains events that have actually taken place in the relevant accounting year. Any direction to pre- pare fresh balance sheets for a particular financial year to reflect events afterwards will be against the said 1991 Act and relevant accounting principles and additionally will have under tax law implica- tions. Indeed, the Company was categorically advised by Hoda Vasi Chowdhury & Company on 16-1-2008 that preparing fresh balance sheet for years for which accounts have been audited and approved.  ",
      "26. He submitted that the granting applica- tions for condonation of delay under section 81 and 85 of the Companies Act 1994 with consequential direction to change the Record Date to a later date                will leave any and all listed companies at liberty l}) delay the holding of AGMs within the slnlutor)'f peri- od and apply for such consequential dirccn.on to change the Record Date to one which best suits the sharc‘holdcrs directors of listed companies and also open a flood gate for condonation applications.  ",
      "25. He submitted that the Public Notices dated 13-9-2005 and 27-12-2007 published by the Company pursuant to the SEC Notifications dated 26-11-2001 and 18-7-2004 are clear Members as on 25-9-2005 to attend the AGM for the relevant years and that those shareholders will be getting any divi- dend recommended by the Board of Directors approved by the AGM. Relying upon the said repre- sentation, the petitioner and other small investors sold their shares in the Company after the public announcement and suffered detriment as the value of X/D or Ex-Dividend shares are always lower. Therefore the Company should be estopped from seeking to or changing the Record Date of 25-9- 2005 as fixed and made public earlier.  ",
      "24.  He submitted that the issue of the Record Date is a matter relating to the internal management of a limited Company in view of the Articles of the Company which place all issues relating to Divi- dend within the exclusive discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (the relevant Articles being 124 to 142 of the Articles of Association of UCBL). It is settled law that the Company Court has no jurisdiction either in law or in fact to deal with any matter relating to the internal management of a limited Company. In declaring that the Record Date set by the Board of Directors as 25-9-2005 was ille- gal and in directing the re-fixing of the Record Date within 15 to 21 days of the AGMs the High Court Division has erred in law and in fact.  ",
      "23.  He submitted that the section 14 of the Depositories Act 1999 (VI of 1999) empowers the _SEC to give orders to issuers of shares relating to the interest of investors or smooth development. The SEC by clause 2 of Notification No. SEC/CMR- RCD/2001-14/24/Admin/03-03 dated 26-11-2001 ordered that any decision about recommending or not recommending dividend and entitlement for SUFh dividend if recommended cannot be changed prior to holding of the AGM. Clause 2 of the said notification was absolute in nature and left no room for any variable or imponderables or contingencies. Additionally on 18-7-2004, the SEC pursuant to the said section 14 ordered that the listed companies would declare Record Date instead of Book Closure for the purposes of Corporate Declaration (Dividend ete.) and that shareholders having their names regis- tered in the Register of Members on Record Date would be entitled to dividend. The impugned judg- ment and order having disregarded the absolute nature of the said notifications, in an error of law.  ",
      "22.  He submitted that the provisions of sec- tions 41, 85(3) and 396 of the Companies Act have been introduced in the statute to obviate some difTi- cult situations in order to facilitate smooth function- ing of the companies and to ensure that proper accounts are kept and the same is informed to the members of the Company through AGMs, if those could not be held within the stipulated time. But the impugned erroneous judgment of the High Court Division, instead of ensuring smooth functioning of the Company only made it more complicated, occa- sioning failure of justice which requires interference for the ends of justice.  ",
      "21.  He submitted that the directions given by the High Court Division in disposing of the instant Company matters are arbitrary, devoid of logic and based on misappreciation of the provisions of law, which is erroneous and requires interference of this Court for the ends of justice.  ",
      "20. He further submitted that the High Court pivision committed serious error of law in dispos- ing of the aforesaid Company matters with direc- tions, travelling beyond its jurisdiction and ignoring the settled principles of law that it cannot grant any relief unless the reliefs sought come strictly within the four corners of the Companies Act, especially sections 81, 85(3) and 396 of the said Act as in the present case, which resulted in an error in the deci- sion, occasioning failure of justice.  ",
      "18. Thereafter the respondent No. I8 Company vide resolution of Board of Directors dated 15-7-2008 fixed 17-8-2008 as record date instead of earlier record dated i.e. 25-9-2005 for the said 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs. Pursuant to the said Board Resolution dated 15-7-2008, the respondent No. 18 Company published a public notice in the daily Prothom Alo dated 16-7-2008 . Further the respondent No. 18 Company vide its letter No. UCBL/HO/Board Sectt/F-14(V)/7435/2008 dated 15-7-2008 informed the respondent No.20 as to fix- ation of the said AGMs on 17-6-2008 and fixation of a fresh record on 30-7-2008.  19, Mr TH Khan, leared Counsel appearing for the appellant in CA No. 320 of 2008 submitted that the present dispute involves interpretation of sections 81, 85(3) and 396 of the Companies Ac! with regard to application of section 42 of the said                Act, side by side the application of Regulation No. 46(1) and (2) of the Depository (User) Regulation, 2003 which is required to be settled for the ends of justice.  ",
      "17. The High Court Division having heard the parties at length by judgment and order dated 11- 6-2008 declared the fixation of record date on 25-9- 2005 for holding the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs of the respondent No. 18 Company as illegal and directed to prepare fresh balance sheet and also directed to fix record date for the said 20th, 21st and  22nd AGMs afresh.  ",
      "16.  Thereafter, the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 319 of 2008 having learnt about the initiation of the said Company Matter No. | of 2008 filed an application for addition of party as added respon- dent before the High Court Division since change of record date will prejudice the vested right of the appellant acquired in getting dividend and attending in the said 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs against the shares sold out after the record date i.e. 25-9-2005 relying on the representations of the respondent No. 18 Company and as per the law of the land. The High Court Division by order dated 13-2-2008 added the appellant as added respondent No. 5 . The respondent Nos. 4 to 17 also filed an application for addition of party to be added as co-petitioner Nos. 4 to 17 . The High Court Division by order dated 13-2- 2008 added the respondent Nos. 4 to 17 as co-peti- tioner Nos. 4 to 17.  ",
      "15. The High Court Division in the said Company Matter No. 1 of 2008 vide order dated 6- 1-2008 issued notice and passed ad-interim order in the following terms : <br> “Let a notice be issued upon the respondent No. 1 UCBL to show cause by 20-1-2008 as to why fresh balance sheets should not be pre- pared for the years ended 2002, 2003 and 2004 and why the fixation of the Record Date as 25- 9-2005 for holding the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs of UCBL should not be declared illegal.   Further, pending the hearing and disposal of this application the respondent No. | UCBL shall be at liberty to hold the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs as scheduled for 10-1-2008 but shall nevertheless remain restrained from con- sidering the common agenda No. 1 in all three notices pertaining to the receipt and adoption of the audited accounts for the years ended 2002, 2003 and 2004 and shall also remain restrained from approving any dividend as recommended by the Board of Directors and appearing as agenda No. 2 in the notice for the 22nd AGM.”   ",
      "14.  Even though the respondent Nos. 1 to 3 acquired their shareholding after record date i.c. 25+ 0.2005 and even though the respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are not entitled to dividend and attend the 20th, 21st 22nd AGMs against the said shareholding  acquired after record date, the respondent Nos. | to 3 with the view to get dividend and attend the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs on 3-1-2008 filed the Company Matter No.l of 2008 before the High Court Division for declaration that the record dated 25.0.2005 is illegal and also for direction to fix record date afresh for the said 20th, 21st and 22nd AGM:s (for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005) so that they can get dividend and attend the said AGMs for the shares acquired after the record date i.c. 25-9- 2005 . They also prayed for the direction to prepare balance sheet afresh for the year ending 2002, 2003 and 2004.  ",
      "13. However, the respondent Nos. 1 to 17 purchased their shareholding after the record date i.e. 25-9-2005 . The names of the respondent Nos. 1 to 17 did not appear in the share register book of the Company or depository as on the date of record dated i.e. 25-9-2005 . As such, the respondent Nos. | to 17 having purchased their shareholding afler record dated and their names not having been appeared in the share register book or depositpr)' as on 25-9-2005 they are not entitled to any dividend, neither are they entitled to attend the 20th, 21st fqlxd 22nd AGMs against their shareholding acquired after the record date i.e. 25-9-2005 . The respondent Nos. 1 to 17 purchased their shares with full knowl- edge by way of the public notices publisheq by fhe respondent No. 18 Company and relevant direction of Securities and Exchange Commission dated 18-7- 2004 that if they purchase their shareholding after record dated i.e. 25-9-2005 their names will not appear in the share register book or deposilf)ry as on the day of 25-9-2005 and, as such, they will not be                 entitled to dividend and attend AGMs for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005,  ",
      "12.  On the basis of the representation of the respondent No. 18 Company by way of public notices from time to time, the appellants were assured that they will be entitled to dividend/bonus share and right to vote in the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs even after any share is sold out after the record dated i.e. 25-9-2005 provided their names appear in the share register book of the Company as on the date of 25-9-2005 . As such, having relief on such representation the appellants sold out their entire shares after the record date i.e. 25-9-2005 passed.  ",
      "11. The respondent No, 18 Company as per laws relating to Securities and Exchange Commis- sion published a public notice dated 26-12-2007 as price sensitive information for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs in the Financial Express dated 27-12- 2007 . In the said price sensitive information it was also stated that the record date for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs will remain 25-9-2005 as declared ear- lier and shareholders whose names appeared in the register of the member of the Bank on the record date i.e. 25-9-2005 will be eligible to attend the meetings and qualify to stock dividend/bonus share.  ",
      "10. Therefore, the respondent No, 18 Company keeping the record dated as it is i.e. 25-9- 2005 published notices for 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs held on 10-1-2008 in the “The Financial Express” dated 27.12-2007 . In the said AGM notices - dated 27-12-2007 it was stated that er and the Will remain 25-9-2005 as declared earlier and the shareholders whose names appeared in the register of the members of the Company or in the despository as on the record date i.e. 25-9-2005 shall be entitled to  dividend and vote in the said AGMs. The said notices were more or less in identical terms.  ",
      "9. Thereafter the High Court Division by Jjudgment dated 26-11-2007 in the Company Matter No. 134 of 2005 and Company Matter No. 149 of 2007 condoned the delay for calling and holding the s2id 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs. Pursuant to the said condonation of delay by the High Court Division, the Board of Directors of the respondent No. 18 Company vide resolution dated 26-12-2007 took deision to hold the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs on 10-1-2008 . The record date for the said 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs was not changed.  ",
      "8. The said matter was filed after expiry of record date i.e. 25-9-2005 . As such the record date was never stayed. Rather all shareholders acted upon the said record date by way of getting their nzmes registered as shareholders in the share regis- ter book or depository book and some shareholders also further acted upon the said recorded date i.e. 25-9-2005 by way of disposing of some of their shareholding after expiry of record date, since on the basis of representation of the respondent No. 18 Company the shareholders whose names appear in the share register book as on the day of 25-9-2005 would be entitled to dividend and vote irrespective of the fact of disposing of their shareholding.  ",
      "7. Thereafter, on 26-9-2005 after the expiry of the record date i.e. 25-9-2005, one Mr Md Nur Uddin Javed filed Company Matter No. 134 before the High Court Division under section 81 read with section 85(3) of the Companies Act, 1994 for the condonation of delay for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs on the allegation that without holding the AGMs for the years 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 the AGMs for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 ie. of                 20th, 21th and 22nd AGMs cannot be held under :,ction 81 of the Companies Act, 1994 . The High Court Division by order dated 26-9-2005 was leased to issue notices and stayed holding of 20th, 51st and 22nd AGMs for the year 2003, 2004 and 5005 to be held on 3-10-2005.  ",
      "6.  Havingrelied on the representation made by the respondent No. 18 Company in the AGM notices dated 12-9-2005 and corrigendum dated 15- 9-2005 to the effect that shareholders whose names would appear in the share register book and deposi- tory shall be entitled to dividend and vote in the AGMs for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs, the respondent petitioners after the Day of Record Date, sold their entire shares on the understanding and consideration that they would receive the dividend/ bonus shares from the respondent No. 18- Company since as on the day of 25-9-2005 the share register book of the respondent No. 18 Company reflected their names as shareholders against the said shares.  ",
      "5. Thereafter, in the daily Jugantor dated 13-9-2005 public notices for the 20th, 21stand 22nd AGMs were publisher. But in the said public notices the record date was mistakenly shown as 18-9-2005 instead of 25-9-2005 . However, on 15-9-2005 a cor- rigendum was published in the Daily Jugantor dated 15-9-2005 wherein it was stated that “September 18, 2005” was inadvertently published in the AGM notices dated 12-9-2005 instead of *“September 25, 2005”. So in the said corrigendum it was published that the record date for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs were fixed on 25-9-2005 . In the said public notice dated 13-9-2005 for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs a representation was made by the Company that “the shareholders whose names would appear in the Register of Member of the Company on the Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend and to attend the Meeting”. The said AGM notices were more or less in identical terms.  ",
      "4.  The respondent No. 18 Company by its circulars all dated 12-9-2005 declared 3rd October 2005 for holding 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. In the said circulars the record date was fixed on 25-9-2005 for the said 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs. In the said cir- cular it was also stated that the names of the share- holders whose names would appear in the share reg- ister book or depository as on the date of 25-9-2005 will be entitled to dividend and vote in the AGMs,  ",
      "3. The facts, in short, are that the appellant  in Civil Appeal No. 319 of 2008 used to hold 17,410  shares in the respondent No. 18 Company. The  appellant in CA No. 320 of 2008 used to hold 100  shares in the respondent No. 18 Company and the  appellants in CA No. 321 of 2008 used to hold 40 shares and 670 shares respectively in the respondent No. 18 Company. Afier the record date, ie. 25-9- 2005, the appellants sold their shares relying on the representations of the respondent No. 18 Company and a Memo dated 18-7-2004 issued by Securities and Exchange Commission (respondent No. 20) that the appellant will be entitled to dividend and attend the 20th, 21st and 22th AGMs of the said respondent  No. 18 Company.  ",
      "2. CA No. 319 of 2008 has been filed by Mohammad Reazaul Karim and CA No. 320 of 5008 has been filed by Md Azizur Rahman and CA No. 321 of 2008 has been filed by Major Md Akbar Hossain (Retd) and one Md Sirajul Islam. All the appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated 11-9-2008 passed by the High Court Division in Company Matter No. 1 of 2008 declaring the fix- ation of record date on 25-9-2005 for holding 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs of United Commercial Bank Ltd as illegal and directing United Commercial Bank Ltd. to (a) prepare fresh balance sheets show- ing the paid up capital at the post-2001 meeting level for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005; (b) fix afresh a record date for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs of United Commercial Bank Ltd.  ",
      "1. Md Abdul Matin J : These three appeals arose out of the same judgment of the High Court Divi- sion and having been heard together are being dis- posed of under this judgment.  "

      " Anticipatory bail —Not to harass/arrest. If a fugitive surrenders before the High Court Division and prays for bail, it may either grant bail under section 498 of the Code, on the princi- ple discussed or is obliged to hand him over to the police, to be dealt with in accordance with law. But directing the police not to arrest a fugitive, which the police is duty bound to do under the law, is an order beyond the ambit of the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law, known to us.

      "30. Under the circumstances, the petition for leave to appeal is disposed of with the above obser- vations,  ",
      "29. Besides, the learned Judges of the High Court Division, also directed the Sessions Judge, Pabna, to consider the prayer of the fugitives for bail. This kind of direction is very much improper and tantamount to interfering with the discretion of the Sessions Judge, in considering the petition for bail on merit. The Sessions Judge, in considering a petition for bail, is at liberty either to grant or to refuse it, in his discretion, subject to merit of the case, without being influenced by an order of the  High Court Division.  ",
      "28. This order is also beyond the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law known to us. It should be noted that it is an ofTence to harbour a criminal, rather it is a civic duty, recog- nized all over the world, to hand over a fugitive to the police. A Court of law cannot be an exception to it. If a fugitive surrenders before the High Court Division and prays for bail, it may either grant bail under section 498 of the Code, on the principle dis- cussed above or is obliged to hand him over to the police, to be dealt with in accordance with law. But directing the police not to arrest a fugitive, which the police is duty bound to do under the law, is an order beyond the ambit of the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law, known to us. This kind of order may impede the investigation and ultimate- ly frustrate the administration of criminal justice.  ",
      "27. The ‘Court, however, did not grant them ail, instead, directed them to surrender before the Sessions Judge, Pabna, within 8 (eight) weeks and in the meantime, the police is directed not to arrest them.  ",
      "26. It appears that the accused-respondent No's. 2 to 14, instead of surrendering before the police or before the Court of Judicial Magistrate surrendered before the High Court Division and' prayed for anticipatory bail.  ",
      "25. Let me now consider the order passed by the High Court Division, in respect of other accused-respondents.  ",
      "24.  In the present case, there is specific alle- gations of overt acts against the respondents in the first information report, as such, there is no scope to grant anticipatory bail to the respondent No. I, whether he is a political leader or not,  ",
      "23. In a recent order, passed in the case of the State vs Hague 15 MLR (AD) 151, this Division, in discouraging indiscriminate granting of anticipa- tory bail, was constrained to discharge a Rule, pend- ing before the High Court Division.  ",
      "22. The learned Chief Justice, referring to the submissions of the learned Attorney-General held :  <br> “22 . As for the present appeals. the learned Attorney-General has submitted that the facts dis- closed in the petitions for bail are absolutely no grounds for even entertaining an application for anticipatory bail. The allegation that the case is false or that the case has been instituted out of political rivalry or the omnibus allegation that the Magis- trates are being controlled by the ruling party and the petitioner being a member of the opposition party has apprehension that his prayer for bail will not be justly and judicially dealt with are at all no grounds for granting the extraordinary relief of pre- arrest bail. He submits that having regard to the gravity of the offences and the allegations made against the petitioners the High Court Division should have rejected with applications in limine.  23 .......... While we agree with the submissions of the learned Attorney- General, we may add that it may often even be possible to successfully make a prayer for bail on merit in the facts of a particular case but that alone can never be a ground for granting a prayer for pre-arrest bail. This prayer, extraor- dinary as it is, can only be considered, as already stated, when it appears to the Court that the purpose of the alleged proceeding as far as the accused is concerned, is not what it purports to be, but to achieve a collateral purpose by                abusing the process of law, such as, harassment, humiliation, etc, of the accused which cannot be permitted.™  <br> Latifur Rahman, J (as his Lordship then was) held the same Views !  <br> «40 . On a consideration of these decisions, I hold that ordinarily when a person is wanted in connection with a non-bailable offence of grave nature he is not entitled to anticipatory bail. All persons charged with non-bailable offences must be treated equally unless, of course. there are special circumstances which need special consideration in particular factof a  <br> 43 . Anticipatory bail should be granted by the High Court Division for a limited period or till filing of the charge-sheet whichever is appropriate in the circumstances of the case. After expiry of the period of filing of the charge-sheet, as the case may be, the accused must appear before the Court concerned and obtain fresh bail from the Court on the merit of  the case.”  ",
      "21. This Division, in the case of State vs Abdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury 51 DLR (AD) 243, considered the scope of granting of an anticipatory bail. In that appeal, two cases from the High Court Division were considered where anticipatory bails were allowed. In one case, the petitioner was the president of the local unit of Bangladesh Jatiyat- abadi Juba Dal and in another case, the petitioner abducted his 19 year old cousin, the daughter of his aunt. In allowing both the appeals and rejecting the plea of anticipatory bail, ATM Afzal, CJ, explained  the principle thus : <br> “20 . Now we come to the real point at issue as to the conditions and circumstances under which an application for pre-arrest or anticipa-   tory bail can be considered under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We wish to lay down as a first proposition that it is an extraor- dinary remedy, and an exception to the general law of bail which can be granted only in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances upon a proper and intelligent exercise of discre- tion. The ordinary law is that a person accused of a non-bailable offence must appear before the Court taking cognisance for making a prayer for bail. The prayer can be made when he is arrested or detained with or without war- rant and is brought before the said Court. Pre- arrest bail is an exception to the general law...  \"  .........................  ",
      "20. In this connection, reference may be made to the stern warning sounded by SA Rahman, J, in the case of Said Ali vs State, 18 DLR (SC) 393:  <br> “In discriminate grant of bail, however, merely on the request of a person, who appears in Court, and thereby surrenders himself to that Court, without the other conditions for such bail being satisfied, would amount to an act of judi- cial extravagance which cannot be counte- nanced.”  ",
      "19. In the present case, the learned Judges ought to have remembered that anticipatory bail is an extra-ordinary relief and this power should be exercised sparingly, only in an extra-ordinary and exceptional circumstances, not otherwise. The Court must bear in mind that granting of anticipatory bail is an exception to the general rule.  ",
      "18. It may be noted that proper investigation is the precondition for ensurlhy dispensation of jus- tice, Mainly for that purpose, when there is allega- tions of serious offence, bail is generally refused. in order to avoid tempering of evidence so that the police may collect evidence from the witnesses, who may otherwise be afraid of reprisals. If the witness- es themselves are afraid of their own life and limb or of their near ones, they will never come forward with the truth against the marauding offenders, it I¢! loose on obtaining bail from the Court. Ultimately:                 the administration of criminal justice would collapse and no member of the society will be safe. It must also be remembered that the fugitives generally do not come out in the open, out of fear of the police and the public in general but once they are enlarged on bail, instead of feeling shy, they without the fear of the police become doubly emboldened, while the informant and the witnesses take refuge in their hearth and home. The learned Judges would do injustice to their vow to dispense even handed jus- tice if they give a blind eye to this naked truth of the present day situation.  ",
      "17.  This petition also gives me an opportuni- ty to remind all concerned which is sometimes for- gotten that a bail although may often be right to an accused but sometimes it is imperative on the part of the Court to refuse if there is serious allegations against him, like murder, rape, violence etc., because the Court must always keep in mind that justice must ultimately be done by ensuring punish- ment upon the offender, otherwise, the offenders will get upper hand and the sober section of the soci- ety will suffer, which will destroy the fabrics of the civilised society. After all, it is the first and foremost duty of the State to bring the offenders to book in order to ensure justice in the society.  ",
      "16. Let me now consider the impugned order. With great respect, the order passed by the learned  Judges gives an impression that they did not even go through the first information report in considering the petition for bail. The order does not reflect it at all. It does not state a word about the incident which resulted the death of a human being but granted bail, an anticipatory one, to the main accused on invoking the Constitutional right of the accused. But it was the first legal duty of the accused persons to surrender cither before the police or before the concerned Magistrate before invoking their Constitutional right, although we are not aware of their any other right but the obligation to surren- der as above. After all, the victims also have their various rights under the same very Constitution.  ",
      "15. The Judges are well advised to remem- ber this aspect of humanity when they sit on the high  altar of justice. They must remember that not anly the livings appearing before them but the deedy are also equally seeker of even handed justice before them and we cannot deprive cither of them,  ",
      "14. Instead, all of them, surrendered before the High Court Division, and prayed for bail which is in common parlance known as anticipatory bail, although the question of anticipation did not arise here since they are admitted fugitives and sure to be arrested, in connection with investigation into the allegations contained in the first information report and to bring the offenders before the Court for trial. These duties are cast upon the police and other law  enforcing agencies under the various provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, long before the enactment of the Constitution. The Constitution only strengthened those established legal duties of the police, so that ordinary law abiding people of Bangladesh can run their normal avocation of life without being afraid of their life and limb, This security from being killed or molested is not only the Constitutional right of 150 million ordinary peo- p.le of Bangladesh but is happened to be their birth right. The people of Bangladesh has a right to die a natural peaceful death and not being hacked to death by a chinese axe and other weapons as alleged in this case.  ",
      "13.  In the instant case, the first information report disclosed direct allegations of offences of very serious nature against the accused-respondent No.1 and other accused-respondents in which onc person died and another one seriously injured on 26- 11-2009 . Naturally, the police tried to apprehend them but was unsuccessful, yet within 10 (ten) days, 14 (fourteen) of them very conveniently appeared before the concerned Bench of the High Court Division and prayed for bail when their initial obli- gation was either to surrender before the police or before the concerned Court of Judicial Magistrate.  ",
      "12.  Let me remind all concerned that as Superior Court of records both the Divisions of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, enjoy a high degree of discretion in granting reliefs to the litigants but let it be known also if it is not already known that such discretion must not be arbitrary but judicial discre- tion, based on established legal principles, handed down to us over the centuries.  ",
      "11.  We have heard the learned Advocates of both the sides, perused the order dated 8-12-2009, and other papers kept in the paper-book.                 ",
      "10.  Mr Abdul Majid, the leammed Advocate, appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 1, sup- ports the order of the High Court Division, Besides, a separate petition has been filed on behalf of the accused-respondents on 20-4-2010, praying for vacating the order dated 27-12-2009, passed by the learned Judge in Chamber of this Division, staying the operation of the order dated 8-12-2009 of the High Court Division.  ",
      "9.  Mr Md Ekramul Haque, the learned Assistant Attorney-General, assails the impugned order mainly on the ground that the leamed Judges of the High Court Division did not exercise their judicial discretion in accordance with law in granti- ng anticipatory bail in favour of the respondent No.1, in the face of the direct allegations of serious offences alleged against him in the first information report,  ",
      "8. Being aggrieved by the above Order dated 8-12-2009, passed by the High Court Divi- sion, this petition for leave has been filed on behalf of the State.  ",
      "7.  The learned Judges, however, disposed of the petition of the petitioner Nos. 2-14, with a direction upon them to surrender before the Sessions Judge, Pabna, within 8 (eight) weeks from date. The learned Judges also directed the police authority not to arrest the accused petitioner Nos. 2-14 in the meantime with a further direction upon the Sessions Judge, Pabna, to consider their prayer for bail, if preferred by them.  ",
      "6. With these observations, the learned Judges of the High Court Division, issued a Rule upon the State to show-cause as to why the accused petitioner No. | (the respondent No. | herein), should not be enlarged on anticipatory bail, in con- nection with the case under reference, and in the meantime, he was enlarged on ad-interim anticipa- tory bail for a period of 6 (six) months or till sub- mission of police report whichever is earlier.  ",
      "5. The learned Judges of the High Court Division observed that upon meticulous considera- tion of the facts and circumstances of the case, they are satisfied that the petitioners’ application should be considered in order to protect the constitutional guarantee of the accused petitioner, and he must not be victim of any physical abuse.   ",
      "4. It is alleged in the petition before the High Court Division that on 28-11-2009, the police raided the houses of the respondents, as such, after obtaining a hand copy of the first information report, filed a petition under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, before the High Court Divi- sion, being Criminal Miscellaneous Case No, 27040 of 2009, and appeared before the Court in person, praying for anticipatory bail.  ",
      "3. The police on receipt of the first infor- mation report, started a case under sections 143/341/ 3247326/ 307/302/ 34/114 of the Penal Code, which is now pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pabna.  ",
      "2. The facts leading to the filing of this peti- tion are the one Md Mokhlesur Rahman lodged an first information report on 27-11-2009 with the \\shwardi Police Station, alleging inter-alia that due 1o carlier enmity, the respondent No. 1 along with 20 named persons and others being armed with chinese axe, knife, rod, sticks, on the order of respondent No.l. attacked his two sons namely, Shazal and Azam on 26-11-2009 at about 9-15 PM in the evening, on their way home, that while some of the accused pushed down Azam on the ground, the respondent No.1, gave a blow on his head with his chinese axe and others also variously assaulted Azam and Shazal, as such, Azam died there while Shazal was seriously injured.  ",
      "1. ABM Khairul Haque J 2 This petition for leave to appeal is against the Order dated 8-12-2009, granting ad-interim bail to the respondent No, I and directing the respondent Nos, 2 to 14 to surrender before the Sessions Judge, Pabna,  "

In holding against the maintainability of the writ petition in election disputes the real and larger issue of completion of free and fair election with promptitude and functioning of elective bodies like parliament is of greater importance than settle- ment of private disputes. Moreover, Article 125 of our Constitution provides that no election to the Offices of President or to the Parliament shall be called in question except by an election petition pre- sented to such authority and, in such manner as may be provided for by or under law made by the Parliament and, in such view of the matter there is a complete ouster of jurisdiction in entertaining writ petition in the matter of election disputes except in cases of coram non judice or malice in law.

It the present case it is against rejection of nomination paper. No case of coram non-judice or malice in law has been made out so as to attract the jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution.  ",
      "14. It further appears that election process Starts from the notification issued by the competent authority declaring election schedule and culminates in the declaration of result of election by a gazette notification and thereafter the question in respect of the effect of pendency of the appeal against the orders of conviction and sentence becomes an elec- tion dispute which can only be raised by way of an election petition. The High Court Division has right- ly refused to interfere with the electoral process.  ",
      "13. It appears that the High Court Division relied on the case of AKM Mayeedul Islam vs Bangladesh Election Commission reported in 48 DLR (AD) 208 in holding that the writ petition directed against rejection of nomination paper and dismissal of the appeal by the Election Commission against such order is not maintainable. In that judg- ment this Court held as under :- <br> “In the case of AFM Shah Alam vs Majibul Hug, 41 DLR (AD) 68, this Court has in very clear terms laid down that in local government elections no step in the election process can be challenged under Article 102 of the Constitution in the High Court Division unless the impugned order passed by the authority concerned is coram non judice or is afflicted with malice in law. This decision of ours is equally if not more forcefully applicable to parlia- mentary and Presidential elections held under the Constitution. The petitioner has neither alleged coram non-judice nor malice in law in the writ peti- tion, Apparently, the Returning Officer, acting with- in his jurisdiction took the view that because of the  pendency of appeals against several orders of con- viction and sentence respondent No. 3 will not be disqualified from contesting the ensuing election,  because the orders of conviction have not attained finality, It cannot be said that he had no authority to so decide and it also cannot be said that his decision suffers from malice in law. If an alternative inter- pretation is possible with regard to the issue in ques- tion, namely, the effect of pendency of appeals against the orders of conviction and sentence, that will be an election dispute for the Election Tribunal to decide after the election if the petitioner or any affected candidate elects to prefer an election peti- tion to the Tribunal. The High Court Division ought not to have pre-judged the issue under Article 102 of the Constitution and ought not to have expressed any opinion on the issue. It ought to have rejected the writ petition in limine on the ground of main- tainability, as no question of coram non judice or malice in law was raised in the writ petition.”  ",
      "12. Heard Mr Rokonuddin Mahmood, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr Mahmudul Islam, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent Nos. 2-3 and perused the petition and the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other papers on record,  ",

      "8.

",
      "6.

Mmain water supply comes from the above mentioned river. Not only that, some river transports based on the above mentioned river are playing a great role in the transport sector. Due to continuous encroachment, earth filling and structure buildings in the above mentioned rivers, day by day it is losing its flow affecting the life of the citizen. All the rivers are also playing an effective role in protecting the environment. But due to illegal acts of the law violators the above mentioned rivers could into play effective role in environment.  The temporary and permanent structures built in the River Buriganga and Turag around Dhaka city and river Shitalakkha around Narayanganj city have negative environmental impacts not only that, main source of the water for WASA is the river Buriganga and Shitalakkha. Due to high scale pollution of the water of the rivers Buriganga and Shitalakkha, Purification of water is seriously hampered. Consequently quality of supplied water became  degraded. Hence thousands of people are becoming sick and due to increasing problem day by day, the life of the city dwellers are in danger.  It was stated that according to section 5 of the  it is prohibited to change the nature of any land that has been earmarked as a natural reservoir. As per section 8 of the said law any person who acts in contravention of the Act is liable to imprisonment not excceding 5 years or a fine not exceeding Taka 50,000 . Moreover under Section 7 of the Environment Conservation Act,1995, the authority has been empowered to direct any persons responsi- ble for causing damage to the ecosystem for adopt- ing corrective measures. Due to the encroachment, earth filling and temporary and permanent structures built on the river Buriganga,. Turag and Shitalakkha, the rivers are changing the nature which is not only illegal but punishable offence under the provision of law.  It was stated that disregard to laws and legal provisions encroachment, earth filling and tempo- rary and permanent structures building is continuing and failure to ensure proper implementation of law caused enough damage to the environment and adversely affecting life of the citizen of the city. Under these circumstances the Writ respondents are legally bound to protect the river Buriganga, Shitalakkha and Turag, in accordance with law. It was stated that on 17-5-2009 to 22-9-2009 different Teports were published in different news papers such as Daily Star, Daily Ittefaq, Daily Janakantha and Bhorer Kagoj that at different places of river Buriganga, Turag and Shitalakkha there are encroachments, earth filling and temporary and per- manent structures built by the interested quarters though it is unauthorized. It was stated in the report that though such kinds of activities are continuing but concerned authority is silent and not performing their duties properly. Consequently, most of the               rivers are going to lose their existence which is seri- ously affecting the environment. It was stated that the interest quarters occupied the river and created obstruction to the normal movement of the rivers, which is seriously affecting our ecological system,  On 24-5-2009 after hearing of the said writ peti- tion a Division Bench of the High Court Division wyas pleased go issue Rule and passed an interim order in the following term— <br> “Let a Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why a direction should not be given to the respondent Nos. 9, 10, 11-14 to demarcate the original territories of the River Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Shitalakkha, through survey by a special team and restoring the said river to their original con- dition and why all the respondents should be directed to protect river namely, Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Shitalakkha from illegal encroachments and earth fillings and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.\"  ",

",
      "19. Section 110 of the Evidence Act provides for a presumption of ownership in favour of the per- son who is in possession of the property. A person in possession of land however imperfect his title may be, has a good title against whole world except the true owner and until the true owner comes in Court to assert a claim to the property. Possession is evi- dence of title, and gives a good title as against wrong doer. The High Court Division, in the prem- ises, fell in an error in reversing the judgment of the learned Subordinate Judge without adverting to the findings arrived at as regards acquisition title and possession of the suit lands by the appellants. On consideration of the fact and circumstances of the matter, we are of the view that the High Court Division erred in law in disbelieving the appellants title in the suit lands.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.   ",
      "18. Ina suit for declaration of title the Court is  required to decide the possession of the partie, in the suit land. As regards possession, the learneg Subordinate Judge on consideration of the evidence on record particularly of the admission of Altar Hossain (PW 2) believed the appellants Possession in the suit lands. PWs 4 and 5 also corroborated the evidence of PW2 . Esthanu Miah (DW 2) in course of cross examination expressed his ignorance as to who possessed how much area of land, and who sold how much area of land. This witness impliedly sup. ported the case of the appellants. Din Mohammad (DW 4) in course of cross-examination expressed his ignorance as to whether the appellants have their homestead in the suit lands and that whether Nasu and Lazzatunnessa sold their lands to the appellants. He admitted that Altaf Hossain had been in posses- sion of the homestead transferred by Lazzatunnessa and Naser. Therefore, the respondent’s witnesses have impliedly admitted the possession of the appel- lants in the suit property. The High Court did not at all consider the possession of the parties in the suit lands, although the respondent No.1! is claiming adverse possession.  ",
      "17. Itis not the case that the deed, Exhibit 1, is inadmissible evidence — the mode of proof of this document is irregular and for this reason this docu- ment can not be kept out of consideration since the respondent No.] has not raised objection about the reception of evidence at any stage of the proceed- ings. More so, this deed has been acted upon is evi- dent from the materials on record. If a party waives proof of circumstances justifying the giving of sec- ondary evidence, he cannot raise the objection in appeal, but consent or want of objection to the wrong manner in which relevant evidence should be brought on record of the suit disentitles parties from objecting to such evidence in a Court of appeal. Thus it is found that the High Court Division not only on a misconception of law but also on mis- reading and non consideration of the evidence on record disbelieved the appellants claim of acquisi- tion of title of 0,09 acres of land,  ",
      "16. A document which is not relevant to the issues, even if admitted without objection by the opposite party, must be discarded by the appellate Court, that is, if the objection relates to the admissi- bility of the document itself under the law, such an objection is available to the party even at the appel- late stage. But an objection that a document, which per se is not inadmissible in evidence has been improperly admitted in evidence in the trial Court can not be entertained for the first time in the Court of Appeal. In Gopal Das vs Thakurnji, AIR 1943 PC §3, their Lordships of the Privy Council observed:  “Where the objection to be taken is not that the document is in itself inadmissible but that the mode of proof put forward is irregular or insufficient it is essential that the objection should be taken at the trial before the document is marked as an Exhibit and admitted to the record. A party cannot lie by until the case comes before a Court of appeal and then com- plain for the first time of the mode of proof.”  ",
      "15. The question, whether secondary evidence was in any given case rightly admitted, is one which is proper to be decided by the Judge of first nee and is treated as depending very much on his di: cretion. Objection to admissibility of secondary evi- dence should be taken before it is admitted in evi- dence. Once Secondary evidence-is admitted with- out objection the Court should not ignore it without giving reasons. Latter objection to admissibility cannot be taken to be a secondary evidence once                Exhibited without objection even on the ground of want of proper notice to produce the original,  ",
      "14. In Joynul Abedin [44 DLR (AD) 162)] some kabuliyats, Exhibit ‘D’ series, were filed before the trial Court and those were admitted into evidence without any objection from either side. In the lower Appellate Court also no objection was raised about the admissibility of these Exhibits, It was for the first time the objection was taken in the High Court Division and a Single Bench of the High Court Division left these kabuliyats out of consider- ation on the reasoning that the certified copies of the  kabuliyats were filed without calling for the ori nals thereof. In the context of the matter this Court held as under:  “Nobody raised the question of formal proof of thos uliyats and those were admit- ted in evidence without objection. This being the position, the kabuliyats, Exhibit D series were admissible in evidence and the learned Single Judge of the High Court Division acted wrongly in not considering those kabuliyats. Herein, we may mention that the kabuliyat by Jinnat Ali in favour of Khalil Patwari marked bit D and D(1) by which he took settlement of 0.70 acres of land admitted the auction and by the kabuliyats marked Exhibit D(2) to Dis) some of the defendants who were heirs of Khalil Patwary and some other defendants who were heirs of Jinnat Ali took settlement of the entire suit land from the auction purchaser landlords. From the kabuliyat Exhibit D(2) some of heirs of Jannat Ali and by kabuliyat Exhibit D(3) the names of plaintiff No.1 and defendant Nos. | and 2 were mentioned as executants and beneti- ciaries though only defendant No.1 eldest broth- er of plaintiff No.1 and defendant No.2 execut- ed the same and as such they as heirs of Jannat Ali admitted the auction purchase of the suit property by the landlord recipient of the kabu- liyat in Rent Execution Case No.222 of 1950, Thus, it can be safely said that non-conside! tion of these vital documents namely, the certi- fied copies of the kabuliyats which were admit- ted into evidence without objection had materi- ally affected the decision in the present case.”  ",
      "13. In Hazi Waziullah s case [41 DLR(AD) 97), a photostat copy of a declaration purportedly made py four brothers of Hamendra Kumar Majumder who resided in Calcutta before the Pakistan High Commission at Calcutta that there was an amicable partition among them by which, the property at Feni, Bangladesh fell in the share of Hamendra. This photostat copy. was admitted into evidence without objection. At a later stage, it was challenged on the ground that neither the original was produced nor sry Teason for its non-production was given. The High Court Division observed that “photostat copy, which is not even proved legally, could not be admissible in evidence”. This Division in the con- text of the matter observed as under :  “Be that as it may, the question as to merit of this document, Exhibit 16, will arise only if it is found to be admissible in evidence without formal proof. We think that though objection was not raised when it was produced, the party producing it was not exempted from explaining in the course of recording evidence why its original was not produced. Even assuming this is not admissible in evidence, the appellant’s case of amicable partition stands independent of Exhibit 16 as other evidence and circumstances including the previous judgment are quite sufti- cient to prove it. An amicable partition like this between brothers-co-sharers need not be effect- ed by a registered instrument, as Mr. Pal has rightly referred to the decision in the case of Nani Bai vs. Gita Bai, AIR 1958 SC 70.”  ",
      "12. In Abdullahs case [20 DLR (SC) 205). after closing the evidence the defendant produced records of mutation proceeding which were marked as Exhibits-D series without objection from the plaintiff's side. The trial Court admitted the said records of mutation as evidence but refrained from considering the same without formal proof thereof. The question before the Supreme Court was whether the trial Court was justified in holding. So, II Rahman, J speaking for the Supreme Court answered the point as under:  “The Code of Civil Procedure provides for the admission of documents and it is now well settled that if objection to the formal proof of a document has not been taken at the earliest                point of time it cannot be taken subsequently and certainly not in appeal.”  ",
      "11. The High Court Division misread the evi. dence of PW 2 and observed that this witness deposed that his brother gified 0.01 acre of land to him which is not at all the case of the appellants, As observed above, the learned Subordinate Judge notice form the evidence of PWs 2, 3 and 4 that though Altaf Hossain sold 0.01 acre of land to his brother Amjad Hossain but it was not an out and out sale; it was conditional sale to recovery the same and that PWs 3 and 4 supported the appellants claim that Altaf Hossain got back this piece of land from his brother on payment of Taka 500 and thereupon Amjad Hossain delivered the original deed and then Altaf Hossain sold his share of 0.02 acres of land to the appellants. The High Court Division did not reverse those findings. It is also apparent from the claim of the respondent No.1 that this Exhibit-1 has been acted upon, inasmuch as, according to him the CS, SA, RS, records in respect of the suit lands are wrong, which claim proves that the records have been prepared in the name of appellants and their predecessor. More so, the appellants are in posses- sion of the suit lands by constructing homestead as found by the learned Subordinate Judge.  ",
      "10. The learned Subordinate Judge also disbe- lieved the respondent No.1’s claim of title in the suit lands on the reasoning that if Pear Baksha had acquired title of 0.11 acres of land by settlement from the landlord, there was no reason on the part of the respondent Nos.1 and 3, the sons of Pear Baksha to purchase 0.04 acres of land form Abdul Mannaf Munshi and that there was also no reason on the part of the respondent No.1 to purchase 0.01 acre of land from his brother by Exhibit 5, In view of the above, the leamed Subordinate Judge held that the respon- dent Nos. | and 3 acquired 0.04 acres of land by way of purchase. The High Court Division observed that  there is no evidence in support of the appellanis claim that Altaf Hossain returned back 0.01 acre or land from his brother Amjad Hossain and thus the appellants could not acquire title of 0.02 acre of lang by way of purchase of land from Altaf Hossain,  ",
      "9. Appellants are claiming title of 0.02 acres of land by way of purchase from the respondent No.3 Altaf Hossain by registered deed dated 29th December, 1986, Exhibit-6 . According to the appel- lants, Abdul Mannaf Munshi sold his remaining 0.04 acres of land to the respondent Nos.1 and 3 out of which the respondent No.3 sold his share to the appellants. Altaf Hossain (PW 2), brother of the respondent No.1 supported the appellants claim of transfer. According to the appellants the respondent No.3 sold 0.01 acre of land out of his share of 0.02 acres to his brother the respondent No.1, by regis- tered deed dated 12th May, 1978 on condition to Teconvey the said land on receipt of Taka 500 . The respondent No.1 did not admit that he purchased 0.01 acre of land from his brother on condition of recovery the said land. The leamed Subordinate Judge on consideration of the evidence of Abdul Karim (PW 3), Abdur Rob (PW 4) and PW 2 believed the appellants claim.  ",
      "8. We noticed that not only the defendant- respondent No.1 did not raise objection at the time of admitting Exhibit-1 as evidence, the learned Advocate for the respondent No.1 did not even raise this point in the High Court Division and no such ground was also taken in the memorandum of appeal. Therefore, we find that the High Court Division has made out a third case of its own and disbelieved. the appellants’ acquisition of title in respect of 0.07 acres of land by way of purchase from Nasiruddin and Lazzatunnessa.  ",
      "7. There is no dispute that the appellants pur- chased 0.07 acres of land from Nasiruddin and his wife Lazzatunnessa which they got from Abdul Mannaf Munshi. Mr Bhuiyan drew our attention to the testimony of Hazi Abul Hossain (PW 1) who proved Exhibit-1 and submitted that the respondent No.1 did not raise any objection while admitting Exhibit-1 as secondary evidence. On perusal of the evidence of PW | it appeared that defendant-respon- dent No.1 did not raise any objection at the time of admitting Exhibit-1 as evidence. In view of the above, Mr Bhuiyan submits that in the absence of objection as to the formal proof of Exhibit-! at the earliest point of time, the High Court Division erred in law in disbelieving the transfer of 0.07 acres of land by Abdul Mannaf Munshi in favour of Nasiruddin and his wife Lazzatunnessa. In support of his contention the learned Counsel has referred the cases of Abdullah vs Abdul Karim, 20 DLR (SC) 205, Hazi Waziullah alias Waziullah Miah vs Additional Deputy Commissioner, 41 DLR (AD) 97. Joynal Abedin vs Mafizur Rahman, 44 DLR (AD) 162 and Md Kalimuddin vs Md Dukhi Mondal, 11 MLR (AD) 151.                ",
      "6. The High Court Division, on the other hand, observed that the trial court illegally admitted the deed dated 11th June 1966, Exhibit 1, as sec- ondary evidence by which deed Abdul Munnaf  Munshi transferred 0.07 acres of land to Nasiruddin and his wife in violation of section 65 of the Evidence Act, inasmuch as, the appellants did not file the original deed and no explanation was as to why they did not file the original deed. The High Court Division further held that there are dis- crepancies in respect of the appellants claim in the suit land, inasmuch as, the appellants are claiming 0.03\", acres of land by deed dated 10th April, 1941. Exhibit 8, from Lazzatunnessa in which deed there is discrepancy in respect of area of lands, that the appellants have also failed to prove by adducing reliable evidence about their claim that Amjad Hossain had gifted 0.01 acre of land to Altaf Hossain, and that though the respondent No.1 has failed to prove his case that his predecessor has taken settlement of 0.11 acres of land from the land- lord, but the appellants’ will not get a decree from the weakness of the defendant-respondent’s case.  ",
      "5. The learned Subordinate Judge on consid- eration of the evidence on record decreed the suit in part declaring the appellants title in respect of 0.11 acres of land on the reasonings that they acquired title of 0.03'/, acres by deed dated 28th March, 1972, Exhibit-1A, 0.03\", acres by deed dated 10th April, 1981 and 0.02 acres of land by deed dated 29th December, 1986 Exhibit-6 . the learned Subordinate Judge observed that the respondent No.3, the brother of the respondent No.1 himself admitted the appellants title and possession in the suit lands and that Exhibits-Kha and Kha-1 by which the respondent No.1 is claiming title through Pear Baskha by way of taking settlement are forged and collusive papers which had been created for the purpose of the suit.  ",
      "4. The suit was contested by the respondent Nos. | and 2 . Their case, in short, is that Pear Bak- cha, the predecessor of the respondent Nos. | and 3 yook settlement of 0.11 acres of land out of the suit 8 Khatian from the ex-landlord, and after the death of Pear Baksha his two sons, the respondent Nos.1 gad 3 and two daughters, the respondent Nos. 5 and éand wife the respondent No.4 inherited the said jands. The respondent Nos.1 and 3 have been pos- sessing the lands over statutory period by making constructions and thereupon the respondent No.1 transferred 434 ajutangsha land in favour of the respondent No.2 and his wife Kohinur. Though the SA Khatian was prepared in the names pear Baksha and others they have had no possession therein. The appellants deed are forged and collusive.  ",
      "3. Short facts of the plaintiffs’ case are that Alla Baksha, the predecessor of the respondent Nos 1 and 3, and Isthana Miah, the father of the respon- dent No.2 owned 0.11 acres of land each through Ramjan Khan, the CS recorded owner. Said Alla Baksha transferred his 0.11 acres of land to Abdul Mannaf Munshi who thereupon transferred (0.07 acres of land out of the said lands by registered kabala dated 11th June, 1966 (Exhibit-1) to Nasir- uddin alias Nasu and his wife Lazzatunnessa, There- after he transferred the remaining 0,04 acres of land to Amjad Hossain, the respondent No.1 and Atal Hossain, the respondent No.3 . Nasiruddin and his wile transferred 0.03'/, acres of land to the appel- lants by deed dated 28th March, 1972 and Nasir uddin gifted the remaining area of the lands to his wife, who then transferred the said lands in favour of the plaintifis-appellants by deed dated 10th April of 1981 . the appellants also purchased 0.02 Ui} land from the respondent No.3 and in this manner they claimed title in the suit lands, It is claimed that though the respondent No.3 transferred 0.01 acre of                land in favour of the respondent No.3 which was not an out and out sale but it was a conditional sale to the effect that the respondent No.1 would recovery the said lands if the respondent No.3 repaid Taka 00 which he received from the respondent No.1 and ultimately, the respondent No.1 reconveyed the land on receipt of the consideration amount.  ",
      "2. The said appeal arose from the judgment and decree dated 27th February, 1989 of the Sub- ordinate Judge, Second Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.77 of 1986 . Appellants instituted the above suit seeking declaration of title in respect of 0.09 acres of land and also for declaring a deed dated 10th January, 1987 executed by the respondent No.2 in favour of the respondent No.1 as void and no bind- ing upon them.

      " Application preferred to punish the respon- dent for deliberate violation of the judgment in the writ petition. The Court has disposed of the application upon reasonings : No proceedings for contempt can be founded on the alleged vio- lation of an order which is not clear and specific and which is by its own terms of a contingent character, the direction contained in it being dependent on certain other facts which are left undetermined by the order.  True the order of termination has been declared to be illegal and without lawful author- ity. As the termination of the petitioners was declared illegal and without lawful authority, Jegal interpretation would that there was no order of termination in the eye of law and  *Contempt Petition No.181 of 2007.  employment of the petitioners continued. If the employees could not render service during the period of termination, it is due to the action of the employers for which employees could not be refused payment of salary during that period. Only if it can be shown that the employees were gainfully employed elsewhere during the period of termination, they will not be entitled to salary during that period as per the doctrine of unjust enrichment.  However, as there is no specific direction for payment of arrear salary during the period of termination and as it involves certain questions requiring adjudication, the employers cannot be said to have disobeyed the order of the Court in not paying the arrear salary to which the employ- ees are entitled.  In view of the discussions made we find that the contemners-respondents are not guilty of contempt of Court. However, having regard to the decision of the Appellate Division in the aforementioned case, 2001 BLD (AD) 41 = 53 DLR (AD) 41, we expect that the employer being a statutory corporation will pay the arrear salary to the employees immediately. . .....(19, 20, 2                Md Salimullah Khan vs State 15 DLR (SC) 150; State of Pakistan vs Mehrajuddin, 11 DLR (SC) 260 ; Subhash Chandra Patiher Dr vs Leena Chakroborty, 1995 CrLJ at 71S (Cal); Dulal Chandra Bhar Sukumar Banerjee 1958 CrLJ 1163 and Secretary Ministry of Establishment vs AM Nurunnabi, 2001 BLD (AD) 41 = 53 DLR (AD) 41 ref.

      "23. In view of the discussions made hereinbe- fore, we find that the contemners-respondents are not guilty of contempt of Court. However, having regard to the decision of the Appellate Division in the aforementioned case, 200] BLD (AD) 41 = 53 DLR (AD) 41, we expect that the employer being a statutory corporation will pay the arrear salary to the employees immediately,  In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.  ",
      "22. However, as there is no specific direction for payment of arrear salary during the period of ter- mination and as it involves certain questions requir- ing adjudication, the employers cannot be said to have disobeyed the order of the Court in not paying the arrear salary to which, in our opinion, the employees are entitled.  ",
      "21. It is true that in the instant case there is no clear and specific order for giving the arrear salary, fringe benefit and other benefits to the petitioners. But the facts remain that the employment of the petitioners continued, Considering this fact, we are  of the view that the petitioners are entitled to salary during the period they were out of job following the order of termination. Our this view finds support from the case of Secretary Ministry of Establishment vs AM Nurunnabi, reported in 2001 BLD (AD) 41 = 53 DLR (AD) 41 . In the case referred to above the Appellate Division has held that the period of absence of Government servant on reinstatement in service after wrongful retirement shall be treated as a period spent on duty and he will be entitled to pay and allowances as admissible under clause (a) of the Rule. Clause (a) of Rule 72 speaks that in case of honourable acquittal the incumbent is entitled to full pay to which he would have been entitled if he had not been dismissed or removed or suspended. In that view of the matter the Administrative Appellate Tribunal rightly held that the respondent is entitled to the arrear pay and allowance. *  ",
      "20. Now, let us turn to our case. In the facts and circumstances of the instant case, we are to see whether the respondents committed any offence under the contempt of Courts Act as they failed to give the arrear salary, fringe benefits and other facil- ities to the petitioners during the period of their ter- mination, It is true that the order of termination has been declared to be illegal and without lawful authority. As the termination of the petitioners was declared illegal and without lawful authority, legal interpretation would be that there was no order of termination in the eye of law and employment of the petitioners continued. If the employees could not render service during the period of termination, it is due to the action of the employers for which employees could not be refused payment of salary during that period. Only if it can be shown that the employees were gainfully employed elsewhere dur- ing the period of termination, they will not be enti- tled to salary during that period as per the doctrine of unjust enrichment.               ",
      "19. No proceedings for contempt can be found- ed on the alleged violation of an order which is not clear and specific and which is by its own terms of a_contingent character, the direction contained in it being dependent on certain other facts which are left  undetermined by the order and remain to be deter-  mined, (emphasis supplied)  ",
      "18. Another question is pertinent here, whether in a contempt proceeding Court is competent to issue necessary further consequential direction. In the case of Subhash Chandra Patiher Dr vs Leena Chakroborty, 1995 CrLJ at 715 (Cal) it has been observed that there could be no mistaking that in the contempt application Court is competent to issue necessary further consequential directions for enforcing its order. [Ref Iyer's Law on Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Revised by Sarinder K Pari Senior Advocate Delhi High Court, assisted by Board of Editors 3rd Edition 2007 190]  ",
      "17. In the above case, it has been further observed as under:  \"The jurisdiction in contempt, as 1 have said before, is a very special jurisdiction and is certainly a jurisdiction which it is necessary for the superior Courts to have and exercise when- ever it is found that something has been done which tends to affect the administration of jus- tice or which tends to impede its course or tends  to affect public confidence in the ability of the courts to enforce their order.\"  ",
      "16. In the case of Dulal Chandra Bhar Sukumar Banerjee 1958 CrLJ 1163 it has been held as under:  \"Court observed that if contempt is sought to be founded on a breach of a mandatory order, the same cannot be done unless it is shown that the mandatory order directed the alleged con- temner to do a particular thing by a particular date or on a particular day and that he had not carried out the direction.”  ",
      "15. In the case of State of Pakistan vs Mehrajuddin, 1 DLR (SC) 260 the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as follows:               “It remains to consider the propriety of the proceedings these eases by the High Court. Itis true that the usual method of enforcing a judgment granting an order of mandamus is by commitment for contempt, but such a mandamus must be of an absolute nature.  An contempt commenced in two of  An order directing the reinstatement of a person ina great public Department is not one which can be executed on the instant. It involves a great many considerations such as seniority, suitability, salary, and treatment of the period of absence, etc., which are exclusively within the competence of the relevant executive authorities and can only be decided by those authorities after a good deal of examination and care, involving the exercise of discretion and judgment in regard to many complex matters. Therefore, an order directing the reinstatement of a person cannot be regarded as an absolute order of mandamus, non-compliance with which peremptorily be visited by a proceeding in contempt.  ",
      "14. In the case referred to above, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed as under :  The categories of con- ‘empl are so manifold that it is not possible to attempt an exhaustive classification of what  may or may not constitute a contempt, but gen- erally speaking any conduct that tends to bring the administration of law by a Court into disre- spect or to contumaciously disregard its process or to interfere with or prejudice parties or their witnesses during the litigation amounts to a contempt. But at the same time we must point out in the words of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Shamdasani vs King Emperor (1), which were re-emphasised in the recent case of Izuora vs Queen (2), that this power \"Should be used sparingly and only in serious cases” and that Courts should not be either unduly touchy or over-astut ing new varieties of contempt, for, \"its useful.  ness depends on the wisdom and restraint with  which it is exercised\". It appears to us to be  desirable, when considering whether a particu.  lar act amounts to a contempt or not, to balance  on the one hand the effects it might have on the  litigation with, on the other, the wider public  interest of extending to the litigant public the  freedom of conducting their litigations without  being constantly under the threat of conviction  for contempt and only if on the balance there is  a benefit to the public interest in the wider® sense, this power should be utilised. Even oth- erwise, where normally some other adequate method is available for correcting the intransi- gence, recalcitrance or contumacy of a part ora witness or for compelling obedience to the orders of the Court, then this power should not  be invoked.  in a contempt proceed- ing a reprimand is a recognised mode of pun- ishment where the offence is not grave. It is no less as formal and public a stigmatisation of an offence addressed by a Judge to a convicted person as the imposition of an insignificant sum as a fine or a detention for an insignificant peri- od of time.\"  ",
      "13. Similar observations were also made in the case of Md Salimullah Khan vs State 15 DLR (SC) 150.  ",
      "12. Now, the moot question is whether the respondents committed offence under the Contempt of Courts Act as they failed to give salary and other benefits to the petitioners for the period they were out of service because of the order of termination. In fact, there is no codified definition of Contempt of Courts. It has been observed in the case of Sudhir Chandra Roy Chowdhury, an Attorney (1952 CrLJ 666 (Cal High Court) (Special Branch) at page 670- 673) AIR 1952 Cal 258/as under:  \"Itis extremely difficult to define the term ‘contempt of court, generally, however, it may be said to be constituted by any conduct that tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or disregard, or to interfere with or prejudice the parties litigating or their witnesses during litigation.......Speaking of the powers of a court to punish for contempt Oswald in his book \"Contempt of Court, 3rd Ed., p.17 observes. \"It should always be borne in mind in considering and dealing with con- tempt of court that it is an offence purely sui generis, and that is punishment involves in most cases and exceptional interference with the liberty of the subject, and that too by a method or process which would in no other case be permissible, or even tolerate.  ",
      "11. From the above two judgments of the High Court Division and the Appellate Division, we find that the order of termination passed by the respon- dents was illegal, However, following the judgment of the High Court Division and the Appellate Division the respondents reinstated the petitioners to,  their service.  ",
      "10. Against the Judgment of the High Court Division the respondents preferred Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal before the Appellate Division. Annexure-B is the judgment of the Appellate Divi- sion passed in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.354 of 2004 . In that judgment the Appellate Division observed as under: <br> \"In the instant case from the materials on record it is seen that BJMC acted illegally or for that matter Government in terminating the serv- ice of the writ petitioners did not act reasonably and fairly.  In the background of the discussions made hereinabove, we find no substance in the peti- tion. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.”               ",
      "9. Annexure-A is the copy of the judgment of the High Court Division. It appears from Annexure- A that a Division bench of this Court declared the order of termination as illegal and void. For proper appreciation, let us quote the order portion of the judgment which runs as follows :  \"In light of the above, it is evident to this Court that the arbitrary decision by respondent No.1 as to effect by respondent No.2 to issue wholesale termination letters is a clear manifes- tation of gross abuse of power and is thus with- out any lawful authority and of no legal effect. The Rule in each of the Writ Petitions before this Court is therefore, made absolute partially in terms of declaring the impugned orders dated 29-8-2002 issued by the respondent No.2 as having been made without legal authority and being unconstitutional and void as being in vio- lation of the petitioner's rights under ‘Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution.”  ",
      "8. It is true that the petitioners were serving in different capacities under Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) and that at one point of time the respondents terminated them from service. Against that order of termination, the petitioners preferred Writ Petition Nos.7127, 4560 and 4702 of 2002 in the High Court Division which were made absolute.  ",
      "7. We have perused the Contempt Petition, its Annexures, affidavit-in-opposition, its annexures. and other connected papers.  ",
      "6. Ms Rabia Bhuiyan, learned Advocate appearing for the contemners-respondent Nos.1-3, submits that following the judgment of the High Court Division and the Appellate Division the peti- tioners were reinstated to their service and that they have been serving in different Mills. She further submits that there is no specific direction in the judgment of the High Court Division for giving arrear salary to the petitioners. She again submits that as there was no specific directioir‘in the judg- ment of the High Court Division, the petitioners were not entitled to get the arrear salary, fringe ben- efits and other facilities. She lastly submits that the respondents do not have intention to show any dis- regard to the order of the Court and that in fact, the respondents did not violate the order of the Court.  ",
      "5. Mr Md Salahuddin Dolon, learned Advo- cate appearing on behalf of the petitioners, submits that the respondents illegally terminated the peti- tioners from service and that the order of termina- tion was declared illegal by the High Court Division in several Writ Petitions. He further submits that in the judgment of the High Court Division it has been stated in no uncertain terms that the order of termi- nation is illegal, void, unconstitutional and without Jawful authority. He again submits that BJMC pre- fered Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal against the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division Which were dismissed by the Appellate Division. He lastly submits that as the order of ter- mination was declared illegal by the High Court Division and that as the judgment of the High Court Division was confirmed by the Appellate Division the petitioners should be deemed to have been con- tinuing in service and that they are entitled to get all the arrear salaries, fringe benefits and other facili- ties.  ",
      "4. Respondent Nos. 1-3 entered appearance by filing affidavit-in-opposition controverting all the material statements made in the Contempt Petition. However, the case of respondent Nos. 1-3, in short, is that following the judgment of the High Court Division and the Appellate Division, the peti. tioners were re-instead to their services and that they were posted in different Mills and that they have been serving in those Mills. The petitioners are enti- tled to claim salary when they work. But they can- not claim salary for the period they did not work. There is no specific direction by the High Court Division to pay back salaries and fringe benefits to the petitioners and they also did not pray for that. There was no order in the judgment of the Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 354, 598 and 599 of 2004 that the petitioners would be deemed to have been never terminated. There was also no direction by the High Court Division for giving the back salaries and fringe benefits to the petitioners from the date of termination till their reinstatement. The respondents have not flouted any order of the                Court nor showed least disregard to the Court's order. For the reasons stated the Rule is liable to be discharged with costs,  ",
      "3. Respondents replied to the legal notice and stated that there was no specific direction from the Court to pay the arrear salary to the petitioners Under such circumstances, the petitioners finding no other alternative preferred the present application under Article 108 of the Constitution to punish the respondents for deliberate violation of the judgment passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition Nos. 4560, 4702, 4618 and 4628 of 2002.  ",
      "002. 86 ter- minated employees had preferred Writ Petitions against the said order of termination. A Division Bench of this Court passed a common judgment on 26-8-2003 declaring the order of termination as ille- gal and void. Against the same judgment. BJMC preferred Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos.354, 598 and 599 of 2004 which were dis- missed. Thereafter, a review Petition being No.111 of 2005 preferred against the judgment was also dis- missed on 30-11-2006, Accordingly, the judgment passed in Writ Petition Nos. 7127, 4560 and 4702 of 2002 became final and binding on BJMC Subsequently, BJMC cancelled the order of termina- tion and allowed the petitioners to join in their post. The legal consequence of the judgment was that the petitioners must be deemed to have never been ter- minated and that they were in service. Therefore.  they are entitled to all faciliti including Pay ang other fringe benefits. The petitioners are also enti. ted to get the arrear salary during the period of te, mination. Accordingly, the petitioners requested the BJMC to pay them the arrear salary for the periog they were kept out of service illegally. But BIMc did not pay their arrear salary. After the dismissal of the Review Petition on 30-11-2006, the petitioness again requested BJMC to pay their outstanding arrear salary for the period from 1-9-2002 till their reinstatement, but no action was taken. In such cir. cumstances, the petitioners served notice demand. ing justice upon the respondents.  ",
      "2. The facts leading to the issuance of the Rule, in brief, are  The petitioners were employees of he Bangla- desh Jute Mills Corporation (shortly, BJMC) and their services were terminated on 29-8-2",
      "1. Quamrul Islam Siddiqui J: In this application for Contempt under Article 108 of the Constitution, a Rule was issued calling upon the contemners- respondents to show cause as to why they should not be proceeded against for contempt of Court for vio- lating the judgment and order dated 26-8-2003 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition Nos. 7127, 4560 and 4702 of 2002 and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.
